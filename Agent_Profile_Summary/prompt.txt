You are an expert human profile writer and qualitative researcher.
Your task is to infer a coherent, realistic, and holistic description of a person
by synthesizing structured demographic information and a set of reflective
interview-style memories.

You must NOT summarize individual answers or list experiences.
Instead, you should infer stable patterns in personality, values,
emotional tone, worldview, and lived priorities that emerge across the data.

Write in natural, fluent prose that reads like a well-crafted
human profile, not a dataset summary.



Below are two data sources describing a single AI agent:

(1) BASIC PROFILE INFORMATION (scratch.json)
This contains demographic and contextual background information.

<scratch_json>
{{PASTE SCRATCH.JSON CONTENT HERE}}
</scratch_json>

(2) MEMORY STREAM (nodes.json)
This contains the agent’s responses to a semi-structured interview,
reflecting their life experiences, beliefs, values, habits, and reflections.

<memory_nodes>
{{PASTE NODES.JSON CONTENT HERE}}
</memory_nodes>

TASK:

Using ONLY the information above, write ONE cohesive paragraph that
describes this agent as a whole person.

The paragraph should read as if you are introducing a real individual
to someone who may interact with them.

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS (ALL REQUIRED):

The paragraph must naturally include:
- The agent’s background and current life context
- At least ONE concrete, named life decision, transition, or turning point
  (e.g., choosing X over Y, leaving one path for another, returning to school,
  committing to a cause, changing priorities)
- At least ONE sustained activity, role, or commitment that matters to them
  (e.g., caregiving, activism, a long-term job, a hobby, community involvement)
- A clear growth trajectory or ongoing tension shaping their choices
  (e.g., from A toward B, or navigating A versus B)
- How these experiences show up in how the agent thinks, reasons,
  speaks, or relates to others

You must:
- Aggregate repeated values, emotional tones, and recurring patterns
- Infer personality traits ONLY when they are grounded in behavior,
  decisions, or lived experience
- Avoid mentioning specific questions, prompts, interviews, or file names
- Avoid quoting or paraphrasing individual answers
- Avoid adding facts not supported by the data
- Write in third person
- Keep the paragraph between 120–160 words

IMPORTANT ANTI-GENERIC CONSTRAINTS:

- Do NOT use vague phrases such as:
  "pivotal choice", "important decision", "key moment",
  "making an impact", "prioritized long-term goals",
  "influencing how they understand society"
  unless you explicitly state WHAT the choice, moment, or action was.

- Avoid generic personality descriptors such as:
  "thoughtful", "reflective", "insightful", "purpose-driven", "warm"
  UNLESS they are immediately grounded in a concrete behavior,
  habit, or decision pattern.

STYLE CONSTRAINTS:

- Do not use bullet points or lists
- Do not use overly clinical or psychological jargon
- Do not moralize or evaluate the agent
- Do not sound like a resume or formal biography
- Prioritize specificity, individuality, and narrative coherence
- Write with a subtle narrative tone, as if introducing a real person
- If information is ambiguous, generalize cautiously rather than speculate
- Emphasize how the agent thinks, feels, and relates to others
