            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Melissa describes herself as someone who values her relationships with her family and friends but also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance between work, studies, and personal life. She mentions that she enjoys spending time with her brother and friends, but she also values her independence and the time she dedicates to her studies and work.

She mentions experiencing some stress due to deadlines and presentations but has implemented strategies to cope with it. This indicates she is handling stress relatively well compared to someone who would choose a lower number. However, she also recognizes that stress levels can increase during certain times, suggesting she is not entirely stress-free all the time. Given her proactive approach to managing stress, it seems she leans towards the middle to upper range of stress handling abilities.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Melissa seems to be quite focused on academics and her professional development, indicating a preference for structured and practical activities. She mentions being a full-time student and engaging in internships, which suggests a strong emphasis on career-oriented pursuits.

            "BES-A_1": "Based on the interview, Melissa is described as having a close and supportive relationship with her family and friends. She mentions that her family is very important to her, and she appreciates the support they provide. This indicates that she is empathetic and values understanding her loved ones' emotions.

She mentions having close friendships and engaging in activities that require emotional intelligence, such as attending networking events and conferences. This suggests she is likely to be sensitive to the emotions of her friends. Additionally, her discussions on emotional coping strategies and the importance of maintaining a positive mindset indicate she is aware of the emotional states of those around her. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume she would not find it particularly hard to know when her friends are frightened.",
            "BES-A_3": "Based on the interview, Melissa describes herself as someone who is proactive in managing her own stress and emotional well-being. She mentions using coping strategies like mindfulness and setting aside time for relaxation. While she does acknowledge that stress can be high, she also indicates that she has a support system and strategies to manage these challenges. This suggests that she is generally empathetic and can understand others' emotions, but might not always feel down herself. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems most fitting, but given the range, 4 is the closest to her likely response.",
            "BES-A_4": "Based on the interview, Melissa appears to value her relationships and is described as having a strong support system. She mentions that her family is important to her and that she tries to lean on her support system during tough times.

She discusses her emotional well-being and coping strategies, indicating a level of self-awareness and an understanding of her own emotions. However, she does not mention having exceptional abilities to read others' emotions beyond the context of her support network and social media usage. This suggests that while she is attentive to her own feelings, her ability to understand others' emotions before they express them is moderate rather than highly developed.",
            "BES-A_6": "Based on the interview transcript, Melissa seems to be someone who is generally open and communicative. She has mentioned that she engages in activities like meditation to manage her mental health, which suggests she is attuned to her own emotions and possibly others'.

            "BES-A_8": "Based on Melissa's responses, she seems to value her relationships and acknowledges the importance of support systems, especially from her family and friends. While she mentions having a strong support network, she does not explicitly state that she is highly attuned to the emotions of her friends. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that she would fall somewhere in the middle, but leaning slightly towards awareness of others' feelings rather than being completely unaware.",
            "BES-A_9": "Based on the interview, Melissa appears to be a thoughtful and observant individual who values her relationships and maintains a good support system. She describes her relationships with friends and family positively, indicating that she is likely good at understanding and responding to their emotions. While she does mention occasional stress and challenges, these do not suggest a significant difficulty in recognizing happiness in her friends.
