Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMelissa Steele: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in the United States, though my family has German roots. My parents met in college, both having only completed high school, but they worked hard to give me and my brother every opportunity. Growing up in Naperville, Illinois, we were always encouraged to pursue our interests, and my parents managed to keep us close to home even as we grew older. I attended Naperville North High School, where I excelled academically and participated in various extracurricular activities like debate and drama club. After high school, I decided to stay in the area to attend Northern Illinois University, where I earned my bachelor's degree in business administration.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMelissa Steele: Certainly, one such moment came during my junior year in college when I faced a decision about my future. I had been accepted into several prestigious programs, including a top MBA program in Chicago and a master's program in international business in Europe. On the one hand, staying in Chicago and pursuing the MBA seemed like the safer bet, given the job market and my desire to remain close to home. On the other hand, the European program offered a unique experience and the chance to learn from different perspectives. I ended up choosing the European program, which turned out to be one of the best decisions of my life. It broadened my horizons, taught me valuable skills, and opened doors to opportunities I never would have imagined.\n\n",

The fact that I chose the European program just happened to work out perfectly, leading me to meet amazing people, immerse myself in different cultures, and gain a global perspective that I value deeply. It's one of those moments where you look back and think, 'How did this happen?' but at the same time, you're grateful for all the experiences it brought me.\n\n",

They also provided valuable insights and resources that made the decision-making process less daunting.\n\n",

Rent for my apartment is usually the biggest expense, followed by groceries and utilities. I also set aside money for my student loans and any other bills that come up. Lately, I've been spending more on transportation since my internship is in a different part of town, but I try to offset that by using public transit as much as possible.

I allocate a significant portion of my budget to rent ($700), groceries ($300), and utilities ($200).
