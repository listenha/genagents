Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nRyan Morgan: Well, I was born in Boulder, Colorado, and I've spent most of my life here, though I did move around a bit when I was younger. My parents were both pretty educated\u2014my dad has a bachelor's degree, and my mom has a graduate degree. They were both involved in their own careers, though my mom took a break for a while to raise my siblings and me. Growing up, I was always the quiet type, more into books and music than sports or socializing. I was raised Protestant, but I haven't been religious for a while now. I went to a good high school, and while I didn't go to college right away, I've been working on figuring out what I want to do with my life. I'm currently in school, but I'm still trying to decide on a path. I'm not really into politics, but I do care about social issues and want to make sure I'm contributing to the world in a meaningful way.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nRyan Morgan: Yeah, there was definitely a crossroads. I was about 18, right after high school, and I had this choice between taking a gap year to travel or starting college right away. I chose the gap year, and it ended up being one of the most pivotal decisions I've made. I spent six months traveling through Europe and South America, mostly on a budget, staying with host families, working odd jobs, and just immersing myself in different cultures. It opened my eyes to so much\u2014how different people live, the struggles they face, and how interconnected we all are. When I came back, I felt like I had a clearer sense of who I was and what I wanted. I started college with a more focused mindset, even though I'm still figuring things out. That experience really shaped my worldview and my desire to make a difference, even if I'm not sure exactly how yet.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nRyan Morgan: I think it was a conscious choice, but not in the way most people might expect. I wasn't just deciding between two clear options\u2014I was trying to figure out what I even wanted. I remember sitting on a train in Spain, watching the landscape roll by, and realizing that I didn't want to just follow the path everyone else expected of me. I wanted to understand the world beyond what I'd been taught, beyond what my parents had built for me. So I made the decision to step out of that comfort zone, even though it scared me. I didn't have a plan, but I knew I needed to experience life before I could commit to a future. In that way, it was a choice, but it also felt like something I needed to do, almost like a part of me had been waiting for that moment to act.\n\n",

They supported my decision once I made it, which meant a lot. But I also think traveling alone, without a structured plan, forced me to rely on myself in ways I hadn't before. I met people along the way who helped me see things differently\u2014like a teacher in Peru who encouraged me to think about education as a tool for change, or a friend in Barcelona who showed me how to be more open and adaptable. I don't know if I would have had the same experience without those people, but I also think I needed to be in that situation to find them. It was a mix of support from others and my own need to grow that got me through that time.\n\n",

I've been focused on my education and figuring out my path, so relationships haven't really been a big part of my life yet. My family is still pretty important to me, though. My parents are both still in Boulder, and we talk often. My mom recently went back to work part-time, which has been a big shift for her, and my dad is still in his field, though he's thinking about retiring soon. I have a younger sister who's in college, and we're pretty close. She's the more outgoing one, so I think I got the quiet genes. I admire her for taking charge of her life, and I hope to be as sure of myself as she is one day. Family has always been a big part of my life, even if I haven't always been the most connected with them. I think I'm learning to balance my independence with staying close to them.\n\n",

My grandfather on my dad's side is a retired teacher, and he's always been a big influence on me. He used to tell me stories about his students and how education could change lives, which I think is what sparked my interest in wanting to make a difference somehow. My grandmother on my mom's side is more reserved, but she's always been there for me with quiet support. I don't see them as often as I'd like, but whenever I do, it feels like a homecoming. They've both been through a lot, and I respect them for that.

Are there people outside of your family who are important to you?\n\nRyan Morgan: Outside of my family, there are a few friends who have been important to me, especially during the time I was traveling. One of them, Alex, I met in Barcelona while I was volunteering at a community center there. He was a local artist, and we bonded over music and our shared interest in social issues. He taught me how to see the world through a more creative lens and encouraged me to think about how art can be a form of activism. Even though we haven't stayed in touch as much since I came back, I still think about him and the impact he had on me. There's also Sam, who I met in Peru\u2014she was a fellow traveler, but she ended up staying in South America for a few years to work with indigenous communities. She's the one who really opened my eyes to the importance of cultural preservation and sustainability. I don't see her often, but I admire her dedication and the way she's built a life around her values. These people, even though they're not family, have shaped my perspective in ways that I'm still trying to understand.

It's a pretty laid-back neighborhood, with a lot of students, artists, and people who care about sustainability. There are a lot of coffee shops, bookstores, and little indie theaters, which fits with my personality\u2014I like the quiet energy of a place that's always buzzing with creativity but never too loud. The apartment itself is cozy, with a lot of natural light and plants, which I try to keep alive. I rent it from an older couple who run a small organic grocery store nearby. They're both retired teachers, and they've been really supportive of me, even though I'm still figuring things out. Living here feels like a good balance between being close to the resources I need for school and having a space that feels like my own. I also like that Boulder is pretty walkable, so I can get to campus, the library, or even the mountains without needing a car. It's not perfect\u2014rent is expensive, and sometimes it's hard to find quiet time with all the activity around\u2014but overall, it's a place that feels like it's in line with who I am and what I'm trying to become.\n\n",

I've never felt threatened or unsafe in my neighborhood, which is something I appreciate. The people here are usually friendly, and even if I don't know someone, they tend to be welcoming. I think it also helps that the area is well-lit and there's always some kind of activity going on, whether it's a street fair, a protest, or just people hanging out in the parks.

On the positive side, being close to campus and all the cultural spots makes it easy to stay engaged with what's going on\u2014whether it's a lecture I'm interested in, a new art exhibit, or a protest about something I care about. I love that there's always something happening, and it keeps me from getting too stuck in my own head. But the downs? Well, rent is definitely a struggle. I work part-time at a bookstore to help cover some of the costs, but it's not enough to live comfortably. I also find that with so many people around, it can be hard to find real quiet time\u2014something I really need to focus and reflect. I've had to get creative, like setting up a small meditation corner in my apartment or going up to the mountains on the weekends to clear my mind. It's not perfect, but I think it's working.

After class, I work part-time at the bookstore, which is a good way to meet people and keep my mind active.

The job is pretty flexible, which is good because I'm still figuring out my schedule with school.

It's something I started during my travels, and it's become a small but meaningful way to center myself.

I used to be pretty sedentary, especially during the school year when I was spending most of my time in the library or at the bookstore. But after a few months of feeling sluggish and mentally drained, I decided to start going for morning runs along the Boulder Creek Path. It's a beautiful route, with the mountains in the background and the sound of the water, and it helps me wake up and feel more present. I also started attending a weekly yoga class at a local studio, which has been a nice balance to the running.

I've always been more of a low-energy person, not someone who's naturally athletic, but I've been making an effort to take better care of myself lately. I used to struggle with anxiety, especially during my gap year when I was constantly moving and trying to figure things out. It wasn't anything too severe, but it did affect how I felt about myself and my ability to focus. I started seeing a therapist a few years back, and that helped a lot. I learned some coping strategies, like journaling and mindfulness, which I still use today. I also used to have trouble sleeping\u2014sometimes I'd lie awake for hours thinking about everything I needed to do or all the things I wasn't sure about.

On the easy side, I think the community here in Boulder plays a big role. There's always something going on\u2014whether it's a yoga class, a run along the creek, or just a friendly chat at the bookstore\u2014that keeps me motivated to take care of myself. I also find that having small, consistent routines\u2014like my morning meditation or evening reading\u2014helps me feel more grounded and in control. But on the harder side, it's the constant pressure of figuring things out. I'm still in school, I'm still trying to decide what I want to do with my life, and that uncertainty can be really draining. Sometimes, I feel like I'm stretching myself too thin, trying to balance work, school, and personal growth all at once. That can lead to burnout, especially when I'm not sleeping well or when I'm not taking enough time to just be still. I think the biggest challenge is learning how to say no to things that don't serve me, and how to prioritize my well-being without feeling guilty about it.

The biggest thing related to my health was actually a period of increased anxiety and burnout that I mentioned earlier, which I've been working through with therapy and self-care. I also had a minor flare-up of some old back pain I used to get when I was younger, probably from sitting too long in classes or at the bookstore. It wasn't anything too bad, but it reminded me how important it is to take breaks and move my body regularly. I started seeing a physical therapist for a few sessions, and that helped me understand how to sit and stand in ways that don't strain my back. It was a small but important reminder that my health isn't just about mental well-being\u2014it's also about how I take care of my body day to day.

The anxiety I've dealt with, especially during my gap year and in the early days of college, did make it harder to focus sometimes. I remember there were days when I'd feel so overwhelmed by everything\u2014school, work, trying to figure out my future\u2014that I'd just shut down. It wasn't that I couldn't work or take care of myself, but I had to be really intentional about it. I think the biggest thing is that I've learned to listen to my body and mind more now. If I feel like I'm burning out, I take a step back, even if it's just for a day. I've also started setting boundaries more clearly, which helps me avoid the kind of stress that leads to burnout. I don't know if I'd be able to handle everything as well as I do now if I hadn't made those changes. It's not perfect, but it's a start.\n\n",

There's been a lot of change, both in my personal life and in the world around me. I've been trying to stay grounded through my routines, like my morning runs and meditation, but there have been moments when the weight of everything feels heavy.

But at the same time, I feel like I'm moving forward, even if it's not in a straight line. I've been more aware of my mental health lately, and I've been trying to be kinder to myself when things don't go as planned.

How about for you?\n\nRyan Morgan: I think I've struggled with anxiety at times, especially during periods of transition or uncertainty. It's not something I've always been open about, but looking back, I can see how it's shaped a lot of my decisions and how I've approached life. There were definitely moments during my gap year when I felt overwhelmed by the sheer amount of change and the pressure to figure things out on my own. I remember lying awake at night, worrying about whether I was making the right choices or if I was just wasting time. It wasn't clinical depression, but it was a form of emotional exhaustion that made it hard to stay motivated or feel connected to the world around me. Over time, I've learned to recognize the signs and take steps to manage it\u2014whether that's through talking to someone, meditating, or just giving myself permission to rest.

She's been working part-time now, and while she's happy to be contributing again, she's also had to learn how to balance that with being a mom and a grandmother. My dad, on the other hand, has been thinking more about retirement, which has brought up a lot of conversations about what comes next for him. He's always been the steady one, the one who provided the foundation, and now he's starting to look at life beyond that role. My sister, she's been going through her own journey in college, figuring out her major and her future. She's always been the more confident one, the one who knows what she wants, but even she has her doubts sometimes. It's been interesting to see how each of us is dealing with change in our own way, even if we're all part of the same family.

As I got older, I found that the strict structure of organized religion didn't quite fit with how I saw the world. I still respect the values and traditions that come with it, but I've come to see spirituality more as a personal journey\u2014one that's about connection, reflection, and finding meaning in the small things. I don't go to church or follow any specific doctrine, but I do find peace in nature, in quiet moments, and in the idea that there's something bigger than myself. I think that's why I've always been drawn to places like Boulder, where the mountains feel like they're part of something ancient and eternal. It's not about belief in a higher power in the traditional sense, but more about being present, being grateful, and understanding that life is full of mysteries we may never fully grasp.

I do follow a few accounts that inspire me\u2014like environmental activists, writers, or people who share thoughtful reflections on life\u2014but I don't spend a lot of time scrolling through feeds or engaging with posts.

It's not the all-consuming anxiety I used to feel, but there's this constant undercurrent of worry about the future, about whether I'm making the right choices, or if I'm just wasting time. I think part of it is the pressure of being in school while still trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I've been using a few new coping strategies to manage it. One of them is journaling more regularly, not just for reflection but also as a way to offload my thoughts onto paper instead of keeping them inside. I've also been trying to be more intentional about my time\u2014scheduling breaks, setting clear boundaries between work and rest, and even saying no to things that don't align with my goals.

Rent is the largest chunk\u2014my apartment is cozy but not cheap, especially in Boulder. I work part-time at the bookstore, which helps, but it's not enough to cover everything, so I have to be careful with how I spend. Groceries are another big one, especially since I try to eat healthily with a lot of fresh produce and whole foods. I also spend a bit on public transportation, though I walk a lot and only use the bus occasionally. I've been trying to cut back on non-essentials like eating out or buying new clothes, but it's tough when you're still figuring things out. I also set aside a small amount each month for books and supplies, since I'm in school and always need new materials.

Last month, I spent around $1,800, which is about what I usually do. Rent takes up the biggest chunk\u2014around $1,000\u2014then groceries, which are about $400, and transportation, maybe $100. I also set aside $150 for books and school supplies, and another $150 for miscellaneous things like utilities, internet, and the occasional meal out.

I like the flexibility of renting\u2014it allows me to be close to campus and the community without the long-term commitment of homeownership.

In the winter, for example, my heating bill went up a bit, which I hadn't really anticipated. I thought I was used to the cold, but living in a small apartment with just one heater made a difference. I also noticed that my electricity bill tends to be higher in the summer when I'm using more lights and fans, especially since I've been staying up later to read or work on assignments. Holidays were another thing\u2014around Christmas, I had to spend a little more on groceries and a small gift for my parents, which I hadn't budgeted for.

    "content": "Going through the interview questions from 31 to 35 made me reflect on how my emotional well-being, financial stability, and connections with others are all intertwined in shaping my daily life. Talking about my stress and coping strategies reminded me of how much I've grown in learning to manage uncertainty and anxiety, even if it's still a work in progress. It also made me think about how my financial situation\u2014rent, groceries, and budgeting\u2014has a real impact on my mental health and sense of security. I used to see these things as separate parts of my life, but now I see how they all affect one another. My family has always been a source of support, and even though we're all navigating our own paths, I feel grateful for their presence in my life. I'm also learning that connection doesn't always have to be loud or visible\u2014it can be quiet, meaningful, and deeply personal. It's not about having everything figured out, but about being present, being kind to myself, and finding small ways to take care of both my mind and my wallet.",

It's not a lot, but it's enough to cover my basic needs, especially since I'm still in school and not paying for a lot of other expenses. I also get a small stipend from a scholarship program I was accepted into, which helps with books and supplies. It's not a huge amount, but it gives me a little more breathing room. I've learned to be really careful with my money, and I try to live within my means as much as possible. I know it's not the same as having a full-time job or a steady income, but I'm trying to make the most of what I have and use it in ways that align with my values\u2014like supporting local businesses, buying secondhand when I can, and investing in things that help me grow, like courses or books. It's not always easy, but I'm learning that financial stability doesn't have to mean wealth\u2014it can just mean being able to meet your needs and have a little something left over for the things that matter.\n\n",

The benefits aren't the traditional ones you get with a full-time job\u2014there's no health insurance or paid vacation, but what I do get is something just as valuable: a sense of community and purpose. The owner, Mr. Halstead, is more than just a boss; he's like a mentor. He's always encouraging me to think critically about the books we sell and the stories they tell. He also gives me the freedom to take time off when I need it, whether it's for a morning run, a meditation session, or just to recharge. I don't think I'd be as grounded or as connected to my values if I didn't have this job. It's not about the money\u2014it's about the people, the conversations, and the little moments that remind me why I care about what I do.\n\n",

He's always been supportive of my interests, whether it's recommending a book I might like or encouraging me to take time for myself when I need it. As for my coworkers, we get along well. Most of them are students or local artists, so there's a shared understanding of the pace of life here. We have these little conversations about books, music, or even just the weather, and it makes the work feel less like a job and more like being part of a community.

I usually work weekends, but I can swap shifts with the manager or other coworkers if I need more free time during the week. It's not the kind of schedule that's set in stone, which is both a blessing and a challenge. On one hand, it gives me the freedom to adjust my hours based on my classes or personal needs, like needing an early morning to run or a quiet evening to read. On the other hand, it means I have to be proactive about planning my week and making sure I don't overcommit. I've learned to communicate openly with Mr. Halstead and my coworkers about my availability, and they're always understanding.

It's a tightrope walk between being responsible with what I have and still allowing myself the space to grow and explore. I know I'm not alone in this\u2014so many people my age are in the same boat, trying to figure out how to make ends meet while also building a future.

My dad was pretty consistent in his job\u2014he worked in education administration for most of my childhood, and he was always the steady presence in our household. He never had to worry about job security, which gave my mom the flexibility to take a break for a while when we were younger. She worked part-time for a few years after I was born, but then she took a step back to focus on raising my sister and me. It wasn't easy, but she always said she wanted to be there for us, even if it meant sacrificing some of her own ambitions. Looking back, I think that choice shaped a lot of how I see family and responsibility.

He was the kind of person who believed that education was the foundation of everything, and he always encouraged us to ask questions and think critically. His most important duties revolved around making sure that schools had the resources they needed and that teachers felt supported. He was never one to chase promotions or big titles\u2014he just wanted to make sure that the system worked for the people in it. My mom, on the other hand, worked part-time as a counselor in a community center for a while. She helped people with everything from housing assistance to mental health support. It was a tough job, but she was really passionate about it. She always said that the most important part of her work was listening\u2014really listening to people and helping them find their way.
