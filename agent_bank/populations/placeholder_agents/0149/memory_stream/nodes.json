Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nLaura Sullivan: Well, I was born in Portland, Oregon, and I've always felt a deep connection to the Pacific Northwest. My parents were both well-educated\u2014my father had a graduate degree in engineering, and my mother has a bachelor's in education. We lived in a small neighborhood in the Pacific area when I was a kid, and though I moved to a different city in Oregon when I turned 16, I've always considered myself a Portlander at heart. Growing up, I was pretty sheltered but also had a lot of opportunities because my family was financially stable. I went to college on a part-time basis while working, which was tough, but I managed to earn my bachelor's degree in social work. I've always been drawn to helping others, which is why I ended up in my current job, even though I work part-time now. I'm married to a wonderful man who's also very involved in community work, and we have two kids. Life hasn't been without its challenges, but I've always tried to stay grounded in my faith and my values.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nLaura Sullivan: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped who I am. I was in my early twenties, working full-time at a nonprofit while going to school part-time. I had the chance to take a job offer in Seattle that would have paid significantly more and offered more stability, but it was in a corporate setting that didn't align with my values. At the same time, I was volunteering with a local community center that focused on supporting low-income families, and I felt a deep calling to continue that work. I remember sitting with my husband one night, weighing the pros and cons of each path. He encouraged me to follow my heart, even if it meant less financial security. I chose to stay in the nonprofit sector, and while it was harder financially, it gave me a sense of purpose that I couldn't have gotten anywhere else. That decision solidified my commitment to social work and to living a life that reflects my faith and my belief in helping others. It wasn't an easy choice, but it was the right one for me.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nLaura Sullivan: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made in a single moment. It was more of a gradual realization, like a path unfolding over time. I had always been drawn to helping others, even as a child\u2014whether it was babysitting for neighbors or organizing food drives at my church. But when I was in my early twenties, I started to understand that my values weren't just about being kind or doing good deeds; they were about dedicating my life to a cause that mattered. I didn't just 'choose' to stay in the nonprofit sector\u2014I felt it was where I was meant to be. It wasn't always easy, and there were times when I questioned if I was making the right decision, but I think the difference was that I was actively choosing to align my life with what I believed in, rather than letting external pressures or convenience dictate my path.\n\n",

My husband was my biggest advocate during that time\u2014he reminded me of why I started this journey in the first place. Also, my mentor at the community center, a woman named Margaret, was someone I looked up to. She had been in the nonprofit world for decades and had faced similar challenges. She shared her own story with me, which helped me realize that staying true to my values wasn't just a choice\u2014it was a responsibility. I also leaned on my faith; my parish priest was someone I could talk to openly about my doubts and fears. He didn't push me toward one path or another, but he reminded me that God calls people to different things, and sometimes the hardest path is the one that leads to the most meaningful work. I don't think I could have made that decision without the people who believed in me and encouraged me to listen to my heart.\n\n",

We met in college, actually\u2014though I was working part-time and going to school, he was a full-time student majoring in environmental science. We bonded over our shared love for community service and our commitment to making a difference in the world. We got married a few years after I graduated, and we've been together ever since. We have two kids: a daughter, Emily, who's 8, and a son, Michael, who's 5. Both of them are incredibly curious and compassionate, just like their parents. Raising them has been one of the greatest joys of my life, though it's also come with its own set of challenges. I try to instill in them the same values that were important to me growing up\u2014kindness, faith, and the importance of helping others. Daniel and I both work in community-focused roles, so our kids are used to seeing us involved in volunteer work and local initiatives. It's not always easy balancing work and family, especially with part-time jobs and the demands of raising two kids, but we make it work. Our family is our priority, and I wouldn't trade this life for anything.\n\n",

They've always been a source of love and support, even though we don't see each other as often as I'd like. My father, Richard, is retired now but was a professor of engineering at a local university before he retired. He's always been very proud of my career choices, even though he sometimes worries about the financial stability of working in the nonprofit sector. My mother, Anna, is still active in her community\u2014she volunteers at the same church I grew up in and has taken on a leadership role in the women's group there. She's been a huge influence on me, not just because of her education but because of her unwavering faith and compassion. I also have an older brother, Thomas, who lives in Seattle. He's a teacher, and we don't always see eye to eye politically, but we have a strong bond. We talk often, and even though we disagree on some issues, I respect his perspective.

One person who comes to mind is Margaret, my mentor at the community center I worked at in my early twenties. She was like a second mother to me, offering both guidance and tough love when I needed it most. Her belief in me helped me stay the course when I was tempted to take the corporate job in Seattle. Then there's my best friend, Sarah, who I met in college. We've been through a lot together\u2014late-night study sessions, parenting struggles, and even some personal crises. She's the one I call when I need to vent or just be reminded of why I started this journey in the first place. I also have a small group of friends from my church who meet regularly for coffee and prayer. They're not just friends\u2014they're part of my spiritual family.

It's a tight-knit community where people know each other, and there's always someone willing to lend a hand. We have a local park nearby where we often take the kids, and there's a community center that hosts events like food drives, art classes, and even weekly prayer groups. I've always appreciated the sense of belonging here, and it's one of the reasons I chose to stay in Portland after college.

There's a lot of diversity in the area too\u2014people from different backgrounds, cultures, and walks of life, which I think is really important for raising kids who are open-minded and compassionate.

My parents always emphasized the importance of community and looking out for one another, and I think that's something that's still alive in this neighborhood. There's a sense of mutual respect and care that I don't see in every place. I've never had to worry about walking alone at night or leaving my doors unlocked, which is something I'm grateful for. It also helps that the local police department is very responsive, and there are neighborhood watch programs that keep things peaceful. I think safety is more than just the absence of crime\u2014it's about feeling connected to the people around you, knowing that if something happens, someone will be there to help.

One of the things I love most is the sense of community\u2014it's rare to find a place where people genuinely care about one another. That said, the slower pace of life can sometimes feel overwhelming when I'm juggling work, family, and volunteer commitments. There are days when I feel stretched thin, especially when the kids are sick or when a project at the community center takes up more time than I anticipated.

On weekdays, I usually wake up early, around 6:30 or 7, to get the kids ready for school and have a quiet moment with my coffee before the day starts. I work part-time at the community center, so my days are usually from 9 to 12, and then I pick the kids up from school. After that, I spend the afternoon helping with homework, playing with them, or running errands. I also try to fit in some time for myself\u2014whether it's reading, going for a walk, or just sitting in the garden with a cup of tea. On weekends, we usually have family time\u2014maybe a trip to the park, a visit to my parents, or a simple day at home with a movie and some board games. I also volunteer a few hours each week at the food bank or the local church, which keeps me connected to the community.

My hours are typically from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., Monday through Friday, which allows me to be home with my kids in the afternoons.

I find that starting the day with a few minutes of quiet reflection helps me center myself and remember why I'm here.

They wake up around 7:30 a.m., have breakfast, and then get ready for school. Emily, my daughter, is in third grade, and she has a full day at school, while Michael, my son, is in kindergarten and has a shorter day. After school, Emily usually has an after-school program at the community center where she does homework, plays with other kids, and sometimes participates in art or music activities. Michael is picked up a little earlier, and he usually has some time to play outside before we head home. Once we're back, we have a light snack and then it's homework time\u2014though Michael's homework is pretty minimal.

My husband, Daniel, is always encouraging me to rest when I need to, and my kids remind me to move my body when they're running around the house.

The biggest thing was a flare-up of my knee arthritis last winter, which made it really hard to keep up with the kids and do my job at the community center. I had to take a few weeks off work to rest and see a physical therapist, which was tough because I felt like I was letting everyone down. But honestly, it was a wake-up call. I started incorporating more low-impact exercises, like swimming and gentle yoga, which have helped a lot. I also had a minor anxiety flare-up during the pandemic surge, which I managed with more frequent check-ins with my priest and some regular therapy sessions. It was a difficult time, but it taught me that it's okay to ask for help and that my mental health is just as important as my physical health. I've learned to be more proactive about scheduling time for rest and self-care, even if it's just a few minutes of deep breathing or a walk in the garden.

It was humbling to realize how much I relied on my body to keep up with the demands of work and family. I had to ask Daniel to take over some of the responsibilities for a while, and I felt guilty about it. But in the end, I think it taught me that asking for help isn't a weakness\u2014it's a sign of strength. I also had to adjust how I approached my work at the community center, delegating more tasks and setting clearer boundaries so I could take the time I needed to recover. It wasn't easy, but it helped me realize that I can't pour from an empty cup. Taking care of my health isn't just about being able to work or care for my kids\u2014it's about being present for them, even if that means slowing down and asking for support when I need it.\n\n",

Tell me all about how you have been feeling.\n\nLaura Sullivan: Over the past year, I've felt a mix of emotions\u2014some days I've felt deeply grateful for the life I have, and other days I've felt overwhelmed by the weight of it all. There were moments when I questioned whether I was doing enough, whether I was giving my kids the best possible life, or whether I was making a difference in the community I care so much about. But there were also moments of profound joy\u2014like when Emily won a science fair at school or when Michael learned to ride his bike for the first time. Those little victories reminded me why I keep going. I've also been working on being more present in the moment, which has helped me feel more grounded. I've started setting aside time each evening to just sit with my kids and listen to them talk about their day, without distractions. It's not always easy, especially with the demands of work and the occasional health setback, but I'm learning to be more patient with myself and with the pace of life. I think the past year has been a journey of balance\u2014trying to hold on to what matters most while also being okay with the imperfections of everyday life.\n\n",

The challenges I've faced, like the knee flare-up and anxiety flare during the pandemic, were hard, but they also taught me the importance of asking for help and setting boundaries. I'm learning that health isn't just about avoiding illness\u2014it's about showing up with energy, presence, and compassion for myself and others. I'm grateful for the support I have, and I'm trying to be kinder to myself as I continue this journey of balance and self-care.",

There were days when I felt like I was constantly on edge, worrying about my kids, my job, and the state of the world. I didn't always recognize it as anxiety at first\u2014I just thought I was being overwhelmed by life. But over time, I realized that I needed to take it more seriously. I started talking to my priest more regularly, and I also began seeing a therapist once a month. It's been a process, but it's helped me understand that anxiety doesn't define me, and that it's okay to reach out for help. I've also found that my faith has been a huge source of comfort. When I feel anxious, I try to remind myself that God is with me, and that I'm not alone in this. I'm still learning how to manage it, but I'm grateful for the tools I've gained along the way.

Being Catholic, I find comfort in the rituals, the prayers, and the sense of community that comes with attending Mass every Sunday. It's more than just a tradition\u2014it's a way of grounding myself in something bigger than myself. My faith has been especially important during difficult times, like when I was struggling with anxiety or when I had to make tough decisions about my career. It's given me a sense of purpose and reminded me that I'm not alone in this journey. I also find that my faith influences how I raise my children, teaching them about compassion, forgiveness, and the importance of helping others.

I do use Facebook occasionally to keep in touch with family and old friends, especially my parents and my brother, who don't use other platforms as much.

Michael is in kindergarten, and while his activities are fewer, we still have some costs for his school supplies and a few enrichment programs.

The increase was mainly due to Emily's science club membership and a special field trip fee, as well as some unexpected medical costs related to my knee therapy. Normally, we spend between $2,800 and $3,000 a month, with the majority going toward rent, groceries, and our kids' school-related expenses.

For example, during the winter months, our heating bill went up significantly, which was a bit of a strain on the budget. We also had higher grocery costs during the holidays, especially when we hosted our extended family for Christmas. School-related expenses also vary\u2014when the kids are in full-time school, we have more fees for clubs, uniforms, and supplies, but during summer, those costs drop.

It reminded me that while life has its ups and downs, I've become more intentional about how I handle stress\u2014whether through mindfulness, prayer, or simply talking to someone I trust. I also thought about how our household budget, though not extravagant, requires careful planning and flexibility, especially with the costs of raising two kids and managing my health. It's comforting to know that even with financial challenges, we've found ways to prioritize what matters most\u2014our family, our health, and our community. These reflections helped me appreciate the balance I've found in my life and the ways I've learned to adapt, even when things don't always go as planned.",

That includes Daniel's salary from his environmental consulting job, my part-time income from the community center, and the occasional freelance writing gigs I take on. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our basic needs and some of the extras we value\u2014like our kids' activities, our groceries, and our healthcare. I know it's not the same as what some of my friends earn, but I've learned to be content with what we have. What matters most is that we're able to live with purpose, support each other, and give back to the community in our own way. I think the key is that we're not chasing wealth for its own sake\u2014we're building a life that reflects our values, and that gives me a deep sense of fulfillment, even if it doesn't always look like the traditional American dream.\n\n",

The benefits of the job aren't always the traditional ones you might expect\u2014there's no health insurance or paid vacation in the way that corporate jobs offer, but what we do have is something just as valuable: a sense of purpose and a supportive team. We all know why we're here, and that makes the work feel meaningful even on the toughest days. The community center provides some basic health coverage through a local nonprofit network, and we have a few days of unpaid leave each year for personal or family needs, which we can use for things like medical appointments or mental health days. I also appreciate the flexibility\u2014it's not a 9-to-5 job in the traditional sense, but it allows me to be there for my kids and still contribute to the community. I know it's not perfect, but I wouldn't trade this for a job that paid more but didn't align with my values.

I have a great relationship with my manager, Sarah, who's been with the community center for over a decade. She's not just a supervisor\u2014she's like a mentor to me. She's always been supportive, even when I've had to make tough decisions, like when I chose to stay in the nonprofit sector instead of taking the corporate job in Seattle. She understood where I was coming from and encouraged me to follow my heart. As for my coworkers, we're all in this together. We're a diverse group of people\u2014some are full-time, some part-time, and some volunteers\u2014but we share a common goal: to make a difference in the lives of others. We have a lot of trust and respect for one another, and it shows in the way we collaborate.

I usually work Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., and that gives me the afternoons to be with my kids, do some errands, or catch up on personal tasks. But things can get a bit more flexible during the summer, especially when we have special events or programs at the community center. Sometimes I'll work a few extra hours in the afternoons or even on weekends, depending on what's needed. I also have the freedom to adjust my hours a bit if something comes up at home, which is something I really appreciate.

He was always very dedicated to his work, but he also made sure to be present for our family\u2014whether it was helping with homework or taking us on weekend trips.

He had a deep passion for his work, and I remember how excited he would get when he was working on new projects or helping students solve complex problems. He also made it a point to be involved in our family life, even with his busy schedule. My mother worked part-time as a teacher in a local elementary school, and her most important duties included planning lessons, grading assignments, and supporting her students both academically and emotionally.

His work was both academic and practical\u2014he didn't just teach theory; he made sure students understood how engineering could solve real-world problems. My mother worked for a public elementary school in our town, which was part of the same school district I attended.
