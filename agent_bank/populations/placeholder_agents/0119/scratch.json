  "agent_profile_summary": "David Chen, a 38-year-old financial planner in Seattle, grew up in Shanghai before moving to the U.S. at age five, where his parents worked multiple jobs to support the family. A pivotal moment came when he tutored a struggling student named Leo, which inspired him to pursue a career in financial planning with a focus on helping others from similar backgrounds. Now married to Sarah, a nurse, and raising their young daughter Emily, David balances his full-time job with volunteering at a community food bank and mentoring others. His life is shaped by a tension between his desire to provide a better future for Emily and the financial constraints of his own modest means. He values resilience, community, and education, and his decisions are guided by a deep sense of responsibility to those who helped him along the way, reflecting in his patient, grounded approach to both work and family."
