Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nErica Hendricks: Sure, let's go back to the beginning. I was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, and I've lived here most of my life. My parents, John and Mary Hendricks, were both from small towns in West South Central states. They met and got married in Little Rock when they were in college, but neither of them went beyond high school. My dad worked at a local factory, while my mom stayed home until I was around six years old, when she started working part-time at a grocery store. Growing up, we lived in a modest house on Maple Street, and our family was pretty typical for our neighborhood. We had a close-knit community, and I remember how everyone looked out for each other.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nErica Hendricks: One such moment came when I graduated from high school. I had two options: go to a community college locally or apply to a four-year university out of state. My parents wanted me to stay close, but I felt it was important to pursue higher education and see what else was out there. After much deliberation, I decided to apply to the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. It was a tough decision, but I'm glad I did. It opened up new opportunities and allowed me to grow in ways I couldn't have imagined back then.\n\n",

My parents supported my decision, but ultimately, it was something I felt I needed to do on my own. I wanted to explore different ideas and meet new people, and the university seemed like the perfect opportunity to do that.\n\n",

I also remember talking to my friends and family about my concerns, which gave me the confidence to take the leap and apply to the university.\n\n",

I've been more consistent with my mindfulness practice, which has helped a lot. I also made a point to delegate some of my work responsibilities, which has reduced my workload and given me more time to relax.

That's followed closely by groceries, which can add up quickly with the cost of fresh produce and organic options I prefer. My utility bills are around $150, and I usually spend about $100 on gas for my car, even though I try to walk or bike when possible. Dining out is a rare treat, so that doesn't factor in much.

Around holidays, my grocery bill tends to increase as I try to buy gifts and host small gatherings with friends. School starts and ends haven't affected my expenses much since I don't have children, but I do notice a slight uptick in spending during finals week when my colleagues and I tend to order more takeout.
