Since then, he has balanced part-time work at a local restaurant with high school and community involvement, including mentoring youth through a local group. His mother’s determination to support the family without relying on external aid instilled in him a strong sense of self-reliance and a commitment to contributing to his community. Currently, he lives in downtown San Diego, where he navigates the demands of school, work, and personal goals, all while maintaining a focus on saving for his future. Amin’s life is marked by a steady drive to achieve stability and make a positive impact, shaped by the values of hard work, family, and service that have guided him through both challenge and growth."
