  "agent_profile_summary": "Marcus Cortez, a 33-year-old business analyst in San Francisco, grew up in a working-class household where his parents’ sacrifices underscored the value of education and hard work. After choosing to pursue a scholarship for college over a steady warehouse job, he built a stable career and life, balancing his responsibilities with a commitment to personal growth. He values the quiet stability of his neighborhood, where he enjoys photography as a creative outlet and a way to find peace amid his structured routine. Though he prioritizes career and personal goals over relationships for now, he remains deeply connected to his family, especially his parents and siblings, and hopes to one day offer the same support he received. His journey reflects a tension between ambition and contentment, shaped by a belief that success lies in responsibility, small but consistent efforts, and the importance of grounding oneself in meaningful, if unglamorous, choices."
