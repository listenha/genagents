Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nBrian Schneider: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to a German-American family. My parents, both born and raised in Milwaukee, were my first teachers. My dad worked at a local brewery, while my mom was a homemaker until I was about eight, when she started working part-time at a local grocery store. We lived in a modest house in the East North Side neighborhood, which is known for its Polish and German heritage. Growing up, we attended St. Mary's Catholic Church, where my parents had been members since they got married. I remember the smell of incense and the feeling of being part of a close-knit community.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nBrian Schneider: One such moment came when I was about 18, just before I graduated high school. I had always been interested in engineering, but I was also considering pursuing a career in the arts. One day, my guidance counselor suggested that I take a summer course in engineering at a nearby university. I was hesitant at first, as I wasn't sure if I wanted to commit to a four-year degree in something so different from what I thought I wanted. But after much deliberation, I decided to give it a try. That summer course opened my eyes to a world of possibilities that I never knew existed. It was challenging, but incredibly rewarding. I found myself enjoying the problem-solving aspect of engineering and the hands-on projects. By the end of the summer, I knew that I wanted to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering. I enrolled in the program the following fall and haven't looked back since.\n\n",

There was a moment when I realized that I enjoyed the process of figuring out how things work and solving complex problems. The summer course was a catalyst, but the passion for engineering had been building up over time. I suppose it just became clear to me that this was the path I wanted to take.\n\n",

Looking back, I'm grateful for the push in the right direction and the availability of educational opportunities.\n\n",

But the trade-off is worth it for me because of the proximity to work and the cultural diversity. It's also easier to access various amenities like public transportation, which is great for commuting.
