    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nJennifer Weiss: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born and raised in Princeton, New Jersey, which has always been my home. My parents were both German immigrants who met in graduate school. My father, a high school graduate, worked as a carpenter, while my mother, who holds a bachelor's degree in psychology, started her career as a teacher but later worked in corporate training. Growing up, we lived in a middle-class neighborhood, and our household was filled with books and discussions about politics, culture, and social issues, thanks to my parents' liberal views. My parents instilled in me a strong sense of responsibility and the importance of education. I attended a local public school where I excelled academically, particularly in science and literature. After graduating from high school, I went on to attend Princeton University, where I pursued a degree in political science with a minor in sociology. During my college years, I became increasingly involved in campus activism, focusing on issues such as environmental sustainability, social justice, and civil rights. These experiences greatly shaped my political views and commitment to public service.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nJennifer Weiss: One such moment came during my senior year of college when I had the opportunity to intern at a non-profit organization focused on environmental policy. I was torn between pursuing this internship, which aligned perfectly with my academic interests and passion for environmental advocacy, and taking a job offer from a prestigious consulting firm that promised a lucrative salary and a secure future. Ultimately, I chose the non-profit internship, believing it would allow me to make a meaningful impact in the world. This decision reinforced my commitment to public service and solidified my belief that personal fulfillment comes from working towards social and environmental justice rather than just financial gain.\n\n",

It wasn't just a choice; it was a conviction that aligning my career with my values would bring me greater satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment. This experience taught me the importance of staying true to one's beliefs and passions, even when faced with practical considerations.\n\n",

For example, my professors and advisors at Princeton were instrumental in encouraging me to pursue my interests and passions.

I attribute this partly to the support system I have in place, including friends and colleagues who understand the pressures of my work. I've also been experimenting with new coping strategies, such as meditation and setting clearer boundaries between work and personal time.
