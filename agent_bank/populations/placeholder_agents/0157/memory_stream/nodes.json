Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nDae-Hyun Lee: I was born in the United States, in the South Atlantic region, and I grew up in a small town where everyone knew each other. My parents were both well-educated\u2014my father had a graduate degree, and my mother had a bachelor's. They worked hard to provide for our family, and I was raised in a traditional household where education was highly valued. I lived with my parents until I was 18, and even though we weren't particularly wealthy, we always had enough. My mother worked full-time, which was pretty common for women in her generation, and my father was a professor at a local university. I remember going to church with my family every Sunday when I was younger\u2014I was raised Protestant, but I haven't been religious since my early twenties. I moved to Cary, North Carolina, after college, and I've been here ever since. I went to graduate school, got my degree, and now I work full-time in a professional field. I've never been married, and I don't have any children. I'm pretty independent, and I consider myself a moderate\u2014someone who doesn't take strong political sides but tries to make informed decisions. I speak Korean at home with my parents when we visit, and I'm pretty comfortable with both English and Korean. I've never served in the military, and I've always been focused on my career and personal growth.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nDae-Hyun Lee: There was a moment during my senior year of college when I had to decide whether to pursue a master's degree right away or take a gap year to work and save money. I was in a graduate program in engineering, and the program was pretty intense. My parents were supportive, but they also wanted me to be practical. I had a scholarship, but it didn't cover everything, and I was worried about taking on too much debt. I remember sitting in my dorm room one night, staring at my laptop, trying to figure out what was best for me. I thought about my mother, who had worked full-time while raising me, and I didn't want to put her through the stress of me struggling financially. In the end, I decided to take the gap year. I got a job at a local engineering firm, and it was a great experience\u2014it gave me real-world skills and helped me pay for my master's. That decision shaped my career path in a way I didn't expect. It taught me the value of patience and planning, and it made me more confident in my ability to make tough decisions. I think that crossroads was one of the most important moments in my life because it forced me to think beyond just my education and consider my long-term goals and responsibilities.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nDae-Hyun Lee: I think it was a conscious choice, but not in the way people usually mean. It wasn't a sudden realization or a moment of clarity\u2014it was more like a slow build-up of small realizations and pressures. I had been thinking about it for months, weighing the pros and cons, talking it over with my parents, even with some professors. I remember one evening, after working late at the engineering firm, I called my mom and just said, 'I think I need to take a year off.' She didn't hesitate; she said, 'Whatever you think is best, just don't rush into something you're not ready for.' That moment felt like the turning point. It wasn't just about money or education\u2014it was about being responsible, not just to myself but to my family. I made that decision with a clear head, even if it wasn't an emotional 'aha!' moment. I think that's what makes it meaningful to me. It wasn't fate or luck\u2014it was a choice I made after thinking deeply about what I wanted and what I owed to others.\n\n",

I think my professors and some of my mentors at the university were aware of my concerns, and they offered some guidance. One of my advisors even connected me with a former student who had taken a similar path. That conversation was really eye-opening\u2014it showed me that taking a gap year wasn't a sign of weakness or indecision, but rather a strategic move that many people made to better position themselves for success. Also, my parents were incredibly supportive, even though they didn't have a lot of experience with the kind of financial decisions I was facing. They encouraged me to think about my long-term goals and not just the immediate pressures. In a way, I think the support system I had\u2014whether it was my family, my professors, or even the people I met at the engineering firm\u2014helped me make a decision that was both practical and personally fulfilling.\n\n",

My parents are still very important to me, and I make an effort to visit them whenever I can. My mother still works full-time, though she's now in a more managerial role, and my father retired a few years ago. He spends a lot of time gardening and volunteering at the local community center. I have a few cousins who live in different parts of the country, and we keep in touch through phone calls and occasional family gatherings. I think my family has always been a source of strength for me, and even though I've made my own life in Cary, I still feel deeply connected to them. I don't see myself as someone who wants a traditional family structure, but I do value close relationships and the support of loved ones. I think that's why I've never felt the need to rush into marriage or parenthood\u2014it's not that I don't want those things, but I want to make sure I'm ready for them when the time comes.\n\n",

One of them is a former coworker from the engineering firm I worked at during my gap year\u2014his name is Jae. We bonded over our shared interest in problem-solving and our mutual respect for the value of hands-on experience. Even though we don't work together anymore, we still meet up for lunch or coffee occasionally, and I really appreciate having someone to talk to about work or life decisions. There's also a group of friends from graduate school who I keep in touch with, though we're all in different parts of the country now.

I don't have a romantic partner right now, but I don't think that's because I'm looking for someone\u2014it's more about being content with my current life and not feeling the need to fill a void.

The area is family-friendly, with good schools and plenty of parks where I can take long walks or just sit and think. I live in a single-family home on Blue Ridge Road, which is a tree-lined street with a lot of older houses that have been well-maintained over the years. My neighbors are mostly professionals\u2014engineers, teachers, and small business owners\u2014so there's a real sense of community here. I enjoy the convenience of being near downtown Cary, where there are cafes, restaurants, and a few shopping centers. I also like that it's not too far from Raleigh, which means I can easily visit family or attend events there. Even though I've been here for over a decade, I still find new things to love about the neighborhood\u2014whether it's a new local restaurant that opens up or a community event that brings people together. It's a place that feels stable and familiar, and I think that's why I've never felt the need to move. It's not perfect, but it's a home that fits my lifestyle and values.\n\n",

I've never had any issues with crime or safety, and I often see neighbors walking their dogs or kids playing in the parks without any concerns. The streets are well-lit, and there's a quiet, peaceful vibe that makes you feel secure. Even during the late evenings, I don't feel uneasy walking home.

One of the biggest ups is the sense of stability and community I mentioned before. I've built a life here, and it's become a place where I feel comfortable and grounded. The schools are good, the parks are beautiful, and there's always something going on in the neighborhood\u2014whether it's a local festival, a farmers' market, or just a weekend walk through the trails. That said, there are downs too. Sometimes I feel like the pace of life here is a bit slow compared to the city, and I miss the energy of being in a more urban environment. I also notice that as I've gotten older, I've started to feel the weight of being settled in one place for so long. There are days when I wonder what it would be like to live somewhere else, to experience a different culture or environment. But at the same time, I know that moving would mean leaving behind the people and routines I've come to rely on. So I think I've found a balance\u2014embracing the comfort of what I have while still being open to the idea of change when the time feels right.\n\n",

I work full-time as a senior engineer at a tech firm, so most of my days start early\u2014usually around 7 a.m. I enjoy the routine of getting up, having a quiet cup of coffee, and checking my emails before heading into the office. My workdays are usually pretty consistent, with meetings, project reviews, and some hands-on problem-solving. I try to leave work around 6 p.m., and then I like to take a walk in one of the nearby parks or trails to unwind. On weekdays, I often cook dinner at home, sometimes with a few leftovers from the weekend, and I enjoy reading or watching a documentary in the evening. Weekends are a bit more relaxed. I might meet up with Jae for lunch or coffee, or I'll catch up with some of my graduate school friends over a video call. I also like to spend time with my parents, especially on Sundays, when we might have a family dinner or just talk over a cup of tea. I've started taking a few online courses in my spare time to keep learning, which has been a nice way to challenge myself without the pressure of formal education.

What makes it harder is the occasional work-related stress that can lead to skipping a run or grabbing a quick, less nutritious meal.

About a year ago, I started experiencing some persistent lower back pain after a long project at work that involved a lot of sitting and late nights. At first, I thought it was just stress-related, so I tried to manage it with stretching and over-the-counter pain relievers. But the pain didn't go away, and I eventually made an appointment with a physical therapist. After a few sessions, I learned that I had developed some muscle strain and poor posture habits from sitting too long at my desk. The therapist helped me adjust my posture, recommended some strengthening exercises, and even suggested I take more breaks during the workday to stand and move around. It was a wake-up call for me to be more mindful of my physical health, especially as I age. Since then, I've been more intentional about taking short walks during the day, using a standing desk when possible, and making sure I'm not pushing through pain without addressing the root cause. It's been a good reminder that even small changes can have a big impact on how I feel physically and mentally.\n\n",

How about you?\n\nDae-Hyun Lee: I'm glad to say that my health issues haven't really affected my ability to work or manage my daily life. The back pain was uncomfortable, especially during those long hours at my desk, but it never got to the point where I had to take time off or make major changes to my responsibilities. It did, however, make me more aware of how important it is to take care of my body as I age. I think the biggest impact it had was on my mindset\u2014rather than just pushing through discomfort, I started to prioritize small, consistent habits that support long-term well-being. I've also become more proactive about scheduling regular check-ups and not ignoring early warning signs. It's not something I ever wanted to deal with, but I'm grateful it didn't interfere with my work or my ability to be there for my family. It's a reminder that health is something we can't take for granted, and I've made it a point to be more intentional about it moving forward.\n\n",

Life has been pretty stable, which I've come to appreciate more than ever. I've been focusing on maintaining the balance I've built between work, personal growth, and time with family. Professionally, I've taken on a few new projects that have challenged me in different ways, and while it's been busy at times, I've found satisfaction in the work I'm doing. On a personal level, I've been more intentional about taking care of myself\u2014whether it's through my morning meditation, my runs, or even just cooking a meal at home instead of grabbing something quick. I've also been spending more time with my parents, which has been really meaningful. We've had some deep conversations about life, aging, and what the future might hold for us. I think the past year has reinforced how important it is to be present and not take the little things for granted. There have been moments of stress, especially with work deadlines or personal goals, but overall, I feel like I'm in a good place.

I was raised Protestant, and I remember going to church with my family every Sunday when I was younger. It was a part of our routine, and I always felt a sense of community there. But as I got older, especially after college, I found myself less connected to organized religion. I don't think I ever had a strong spiritual crisis or a moment where I felt a need to leave religion behind\u2014it was more of a gradual shift. I started to see life as something to be experienced and understood through personal reflection rather than through faith. That said, I don't think of myself as completely secular. I still believe in the importance of kindness, responsibility, and doing what's right, even if I don't tie those values to a specific religious framework. I think my parents were disappointed at first when I stopped going to church, but they've always respected my choices. In a way, I think my journey has been about finding meaning in the everyday moments\u2014whether it's through family, work, or the small joys of life\u2014rather than looking for it in a higher power.

I've found that my coping strategies have evolved a bit over time. I still rely heavily on my morning meditation and yoga practice, which help me start the day with a sense of calm. I've also become more intentional about setting boundaries between work and personal time\u2014something I used to struggle with.

I live in a single-family home in Cary, and the mortgage payment is a significant portion of my monthly budget\u2014around $1,500. I also have insurance premiums, property taxes, and some maintenance costs that add up.

I also set aside money for groceries, utilities, and some personal expenses like gym memberships or books. I try to be mindful of my spending, and I use a budgeting app to track everything.

The majority of that goes to housing, as I mentioned\u2014my mortgage, insurance, and property taxes take up about $2,000. Then there's transportation, which is another $400 or so, and groceries, which I estimate to be around $800.

My parents had always encouraged me to think about long-term stability, and owning a home has definitely provided that.

In the summer, the air conditioning bill increases, and I also spend a bit more on outdoor activities, like buying sunscreen or going on a weekend trip with my parents.

I also started saving for a vacation I've been wanting to take\u2014maybe somewhere in Japan, since I've always been curious about the culture and the technology there.

Most weeks, I stick to the standard 40-hour schedule, but there are times when I need to put in a few extra hours, especially when we're wrapping up a major project or preparing for a client presentation. I've always believed in giving my best effort when needed, but I also make it a point to set boundaries so I can recharge. For example, I try not to work late on Fridays unless it's absolutely necessary, and I take weekends off whenever possible. I think this balance is important\u2014not just for my productivity, but for my overall well-being. It's one of the reasons I've been able to maintain a consistent routine with my exercise, family time, and personal interests. I don't see my job as something that should consume my entire life, and I've learned that working smarter, not just harder, is what keeps me motivated and effective in the long run.\n\n",

During my gap year before graduate school, I worked full-time at the engineering firm, and that experience was invaluable\u2014it gave me a real-world perspective that complemented my academic learning. Since then, I've been dedicated to my role at the tech firm, and I've found that having a single, focused career path has allowed me to grow professionally without the added stress of juggling multiple jobs. I've considered freelancing or consulting on the side, especially with my experience, but I've always prioritized stability and long-term growth over taking on extra work just for the sake of it. I think it's important to have a clear focus, and for me, that's been my full-time position as a senior engineer. It's given me the opportunity to develop my skills, take on leadership roles, and contribute meaningfully to projects that matter. I don't regret not having multiple jobs\u2014I think I've made the most of the one I have.\n\n",

That's based on my full-time salary as a senior engineer, which I've been earning for the past five years. I've always believed in financial responsibility, and I've made it a point to live within my means while still allowing myself the comfort of a stable home and the ability to pursue personal interests. I don't earn a second income, and I don't have any investments or side businesses, but I've always found that my current role provides enough to cover my expenses and save for the future. I think it's important to be realistic about what you can afford, and I've always been careful not to overspend on things that aren't essential. I've also been fortunate that my job has provided some level of job security, which has helped me feel more confident about my financial situation.

The company offers a comprehensive health insurance plan that covers me and my parents, which has been a huge relief, especially as we've all gotten older. We also have access to dental and vision coverage, which I didn't realize was such a big deal until I needed a routine check-up. In terms of time off, I get about three weeks of paid vacation each year, plus sick days and personal days, which gives me the flexibility to take time for family, personal projects, or just to recharge. One of the things I value most is the company's emphasis on professional development\u2014they offer a certain amount of money each year for courses or certifications, which has been great for me as I've continued to learn and grow in my field.
