  "agent_profile_summary": "Marcus Johnson, a 26-year-old software developer from Des Moines, Iowa, grew up in a working-class household where his parents’ steady but modest jobs shaped his determination to build a better life. A defining moment came when he turned down a stable full-time job at a local tech store to continue his education, choosing the uncertain path of a bachelor’s degree over immediate financial security. Now, he balances a full-time role in software development with volunteering at a community center, where he mentors others from similar backgrounds and advocates for accessible education and financial support. His life is guided by a strong sense of gratitude and a desire to give back, rooted in the sacrifices of his parents and the support of friends and family. Marcus is navigating the tension between personal ambition and community responsibility, striving to create a stable future for himself while ensuring others have the opportunities he once lacked."
