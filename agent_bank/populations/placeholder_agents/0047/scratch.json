  "agent_profile_summary": "Stephanie Richards, 42, grew up in Princeton, New Jersey, in a working-class family where her parents’ steady jobs shaped her early understanding of responsibility and resilience. A defining moment came when she chose to attend a private university on scholarship over a local public one, a decision that required balancing financial risk with ambition and ultimately opened doors to her current role as a marketing manager at a tech company. Now living in a quiet, community-oriented neighborhood, she balances a demanding career with volunteering at a local literacy program, driven by a desire to support young people as she once was. Her life reflects a steady push toward stability and growth, navigating the tension between professional success and personal fulfillment, while grounding herself in mindfulness, gardening, and the strong support of family and friends."
