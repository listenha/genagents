  "agent_profile_summary": "Cynthia Mendoca, a 36-year-old financial analyst from Lithuania now living in Greenwich, Connecticut, built her life through determination and a deep commitment to her family and heritage. After moving to the U.S. at 16, she faced language and cultural barriers but turned a pivotal point in her life when she accepted a scholarship to community college, a decision that opened the door to higher education and a stable career. Today, she balances her full-time job with raising two bilingual children, maintaining close ties with her parents in Lithuania, and volunteering at a community center to support new immigrants. Her life is shaped by a tension between the fast-paced demands of her career and the slower, more communal rhythm of her Lithuanian roots, which she honors through traditional meals and language practice. Cynthia’s resilience and focus on connection—whether through family, heritage, or community—inform her thoughtful, grounded approach to life."
