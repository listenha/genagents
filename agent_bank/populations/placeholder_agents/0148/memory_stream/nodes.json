Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nLauren Richardson: I was born and raised in Alabama, in a small town in the East South Central region. Growing up, my family wasn't well-off, but we always managed to get by. My mom worked hard to make sure I had the opportunities she didn't, and she went back to school after I was born to get her bachelor's degree. My dad didn't finish high school, but he was a good man who worked multiple jobs to support us. I lived with my parents until I turned 18, and even though we moved to Birmingham when I was a teenager, I always felt connected to my roots. I was a pretty quiet kid, not the most outgoing, but I loved reading and writing. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life until I got to high school, and even then, I didn't have a clear path. I graduated high school and started working full-time right away because I needed to help my family out. I've been working at the same place for a few years now, and while I'm happy with my job, I still dream about going back to school someday. I'm not sure what I want to study yet, but I know I want to make a difference in some way.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nLauren Richardson: I think the crossroads came when I was 19, right after I graduated high school. I had just turned 18 and was working part-time at a local bookstore to help out with expenses, but I wasn't making enough to really support myself. My mom had just finished her bachelor's degree and was working as a teacher, but she still struggled to make ends meet. I remember sitting at the kitchen table one night, looking at my college application forms, and feeling this mix of hope and fear. I knew that going to college would be a big step, but I also knew that staying in Alabama and working full-time was the only way I could help my family. I ended up choosing the job, and I didn't apply to any colleges. That decision shaped a lot of who I am today. I've always felt like I missed out on something, but at the same time, I'm proud of the strength it took to put my family first. I still think about what could have been, but I also know that I made the best choice I could with the information I had at the time.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nLauren Richardson: I think it was a conscious choice, even if it felt like it just happened. I remember weighing the options so carefully, like I was trying to calculate every possible outcome. I didn't want to leave my family behind, and I knew the financial burden of college would be too much for us to handle. I didn't just decide to take the job\u2014I decided to put my dreams on hold for a while, knowing that I could always go back later. It wasn't easy, but I felt like I had no other choice. Looking back, I think I was trying to protect my family, even if it meant sacrificing my own future. I don't regret it, but I also know that part of me will always wonder what might have happened if I had taken a different path.\n\n",

I remember there was a mentorship thing at my high school, but I never really took it seriously. I guess I was too focused on the immediate needs of my family to think about long-term opportunities. I don't know if I would have taken it even if someone had offered, though. It's hard to imagine asking for help when you're used to taking care of yourself and your family. But now, I wish I had been more open to it. Maybe I would have felt less like I was giving up on my dreams and more like I was making a strategic choice for the future.\n\n",

My mom is still a big part of my life\u2014she's the one who pushed me to keep learning, even when I wasn't sure where I was going. We talk a lot, and she's always encouraging me to think about going back to school eventually. My dad isn't around as much anymore; he passed away a few years ago, which was really hard for me. He was a good man, and I miss him. My sister is a few years older than me, and she's living in Atlanta now. She's working in marketing and is doing pretty well for herself.

I've always known that my mom worked hard to give me opportunities, but hearing it all together made me appreciate her even more. When I talked about the crossroads I faced at 19, it felt like I was reliving that moment\u2014sitting at the kitchen table, torn between my dreams and my family's needs. I still feel proud of the choice I made, but there's a part of me that wonders what could have been. It's interesting how I described it as a conscious choice, even if it felt like it just happened. I think that shows how much I was trying to balance everything at once. And when I thought about whether someone could have helped me back then, I realized how much I missed out on by not reaching out for support. Now, I wish I had been more open to it. As for my family today, talking about my mom, dad, and sister reminded me of how much I still care for them, even though my life has taken a different path than theirs. I'm still working toward my own future, and I know that one day I'll find the courage to take that next step.",

One of them, Jamie, is actually the one who encouraged me to think about going back to school a few years ago. She's working in healthcare now and has been going to night classes to get her degree. I admire her for that\u2014she never let the pressures of life stop her from moving forward. We don't see each other as often as I'd like, but we talk regularly, and she always reminds me that it's never too late to chase your dreams. I also have a coworker, Marcus, who's been a good friend and support system over the years. He's been through some tough times too, and we've bonded over our shared struggles. He's the one who first suggested I look into community college programs that might be more affordable.

It's in a part of the city that's been undergoing some changes\u2014more businesses are opening up, and there are a few new apartment complexes going up. I rent a small one-bedroom apartment near the downtown area, which is convenient because I work at a bookstore there. The neighborhood isn't too noisy, and there are a few parks and community centers nearby that I sometimes go to when I have free time.

There are people here who are going through similar things\u2014working multiple jobs, trying to save up, or just figuring out what they want to do next. It's comforting to know I'm not alone in that. I also like that there are a few community programs and local organizations that offer things like job training or financial assistance, even if I haven't taken full advantage of them yet. But there are definitely challenges too. The cost of living has gone up a lot in the past few years, and even though I make a decent wage at the bookstore, it's hard to save much. I sometimes feel like I'm just barely keeping my head above water, and that can be really exhausting. Still, I try to focus on the good things\u2014like the fact that I have a roof over my head, a job I can rely on, and people who care about me.

I start my day early, usually around 6:30 a.m., because I need to get to the bookstore by 8. My job is pretty steady\u2014helping customers, restocking shelves, and sometimes doing inventory. I enjoy the routine of it, even if it's not the most exciting thing in the world. On weekends, I try to take it easy, but I often end up running errands or helping my mom with something.

I used to ignore it, thinking it was just part of the job, but it started getting worse, especially after I started taking those online courses and staying up late to finish assignments. I finally went to the doctor, and they said it's probably from poor posture and muscle strain over time.

The back pain and migraines have made it harder to focus, and I've had to learn how to be more patient with myself. I've also been thinking a lot about my family, especially my mom and sister. They've always been my biggest supporters, and I'm grateful for that. I know I haven't made as much progress as I'd like, but I'm trying to be kinder to myself and not let the weight of everything hold me back. I guess I'm just learning that growth doesn't always happen all at once\u2014it's more like taking small steps every day, even when you don't see the destination yet.\n\n",

How about for you?\n\nLauren Richardson: I think I've struggled with anxiety more than anything else, especially in the past few years. It's not something I used to talk about, but I've started to realize how much it's affected me. There are days when I feel like I'm carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders\u2014my job, my family, my future, and even the small things like paying rent or eating well. I used to push through it, thinking that if I just worked harder, everything would get better. But lately, I've been learning that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and that it's not a sign of weakness. I've started seeing a therapist through a community program, and it's been really helpful. Talking about my thoughts and feelings has made me feel less alone, even if I'm not sure where I'm going yet. I still have bad days, but I'm trying to be more honest with myself and with the people who care about me. It's not easy, but I think it's the first step toward something better.\n\n",

She works long hours as a teacher, and I know she worries about me\u2014not just because I haven't gone to college, but because she wants the best for me. She never says it out loud, but I can see it in the way she looks at me sometimes, like she's waiting for me to take that next step. My sister, on the other hand, has been more open about her own struggles. She's been working hard in Atlanta, but she's also dealing with the pressure of trying to build a life on her own. We talk a lot about it, and I think she sees me as someone who's still figuring things out, which is both comforting and a little frustrating. My dad's passing still affects us all, even though it's been a few years now. He was the one who always made me feel like I could do anything, and I think my mom and I both miss that.

When I was younger, I was raised Protestant, like most of the people in my community, and I went to church with my family on Sundays. It wasn't something I questioned much back then\u2014it was just part of the rhythm of life. But as I got older, especially after my dad passed away, I started thinking more about what it all meant. I don't know if I'd call myself spiritual, but I do believe in something bigger than myself. I think about the people who have supported me, the small moments of kindness, and how even in the hardest times, there's a kind of quiet strength that keeps you going. I don't go to church anymore, and I don't really follow any specific religious practices, but I still find comfort in knowing that I'm not alone in this life. I guess I see it more as a personal belief in connection and resilience rather than a formal religion.\n\n",

I think it's more of a passive thing for me\u2014like, I'll check it once in a while to see what's going on with my mom or my sister, or if someone from high school is posting something.

Groceries were another big one\u2014since I work full-time and help my mom out sometimes, I try to keep meals simple but nutritious.

She's on a fixed income as a teacher, so even though she makes a decent salary, it's not always enough to cover everything.

Renting has always been the way to go for me, especially since I'm still figuring out my long-term plans.

Tell me all about how your bills have fluctuated over the past year.\n\nLauren Richardson: Over the past year, my bills have definitely fluctuated, especially with the seasons and some unexpected expenses. For example, during the winter, my utility bills went up because I was using more electricity for heating, and I had to buy a new blanket for my apartment since the old one was worn out. I also had to replace my laptop last spring because the one I was using for my online writing courses started acting up, and I couldn't afford to keep waiting for repairs. That was a big hit to my budget, but I managed to get a used one through a community buy-and-sell group, which saved me some money. Then there were the holidays\u2014Christmas was tough because I wanted to give my mom and sister something nice, even if it was just a small gift. I ended up buying them both books, which wasn't too expensive, but it still felt like a lot at the time.

I make about $12 an hour, and with 40 hours a week, that adds up to roughly $1,920 before taxes. Then I get an extra $200 or so from my freelance writing gigs, which helps cover some of the smaller expenses. It's not a lot, but it's enough to keep me afloat, especially since I'm not paying for a lot of the things my mom used to cover when I was younger. I know it's not much compared to what other people make, but I'm trying to be grateful for what I have. I also try to budget carefully, because I know how quickly things can get out of hand if I'm not careful. It's a tight balance, but I'm learning to be more mindful of every dollar I spend.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nLauren Richardson: I've been working at the bookstore for almost three years now, and it's become a pretty big part of my life. The benefits aren't anything fancy\u2014there's no health insurance or paid vacation days, just the basics like sick leave and some holiday bonuses. I don't mind it too much because I've always been the type to work hard and not expect too much in return. Still, it's something I've thought about lately, especially with the back pain and migraines I've been dealing with. I know a lot of people in my position would be lucky to have even that, but I also know that it's not enough to really take care of myself long-term. That's why I've been trying to build up some savings and look into other opportunities, like the community college courses I'm taking. I guess I'm just trying to find a way to keep moving forward, even if it's not the most comfortable path.\n\n",

How are your relationships with your coworkers?)\n\nLauren Richardson: My relationships at work are pretty good overall. I get along well with my coworkers\u2014they're all friendly and we often joke around, especially during slow days. We've been through a lot together, like the time the store had to close early because of a storm, and we all ended up staying late to help clean up. My manager is fair, though not always the easiest to talk to. She's pretty strict about following procedures, which I understand because the store runs on a tight schedule. I respect her for that, even if I don't always agree with her decisions. There have been times when I felt like I wasn't getting the recognition I deserved, but I've learned to focus on what I can control. I think the most important thing is that I feel respected and valued here, even if it's not always in the way I'd like. I know I'm not the most ambitious person, but I take pride in doing my job well and being a reliable part of the team.\n\n",

I work the same hours every week\u20148 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday\u2014so I can plan my days around that. It gives me a sense of stability, especially with everything else going on in my life. That said, there are times when things get a little more flexible. For example, if there's a holiday or a special event, the store might close early or have a different schedule, and I've had to adjust a bit then. But for the most part, I know what to expect, which helps me manage my time better. I also like that I can take some time off on the weekends, even if I don't always use it for anything exciting. It's just nice to have that structure, especially when the rest of my life feels so uncertain.\n\n",

I know I'm not struggling in the way some people do, but I also know I'm not in a position to take big risks or make sudden changes. Every dollar I earn feels like it's going toward something I need\u2014rent, groceries, utilities, or my online courses. I don't have much left over, and that can be frustrating because I want to save more, or maybe even take a class that costs more than what I can afford right now. But I also know that I'm not alone in this. A lot of people around me are in the same boat, trying to make ends meet while still holding on to their dreams. I guess I'm trying to be patient with myself and not get too discouraged. I know I'm not where I want to be financially, but I'm still moving forward, even if it's just a little at a time.\n\n",

It's easy to feel like I'm just barely keeping up, but I've learned to be more flexible with my money and find ways to save, even if it's just a little at a time. Reflecting on my occupation and work hours made me appreciate the structure my job provides, even if it's not the most exciting or well-paying.

It wasn't easy\u2014she had to juggle school, work, and taking care of me and my dad, who wasn't always around because he was working multiple jobs to support us.

She was always the one who stayed late, whether it was to help a student who was struggling or to prepare for the next day's classes.

It was a pretty traditional school, not too different from the ones you see in most small towns. She was a history teacher, which I always thought was really cool because she had this way of making the past feel alive. She didn't just read from a textbook\u2014she told stories, brought in artifacts, and made sure her students could connect with the material. But her job wasn't just about teaching. She had to manage a classroom of teenagers, deal with administrative tasks, and sometimes even take on extra duties like advising student clubs or organizing school events.

I value the little moments, like my mom calling me just to check in, or my sister sharing a story from Atlanta, or even the quiet moments at the bookstore when I can lose myself in a book.
