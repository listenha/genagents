  "agent_profile_summary": "Olivia Martinez, a 43-year-old marketing manager in Miami, was born in Cuba and moved to the U.S. at age six, settling in South Beach, where she now lives with her husband, Alex, and their two children, Lucas and Sofia. A pivotal moment in her life came when her parents enrolled her in a private Catholic school, a decision that not only deepened her faith but also shaped her values and sense of community. She balances her demanding career with active involvement in a local nonprofit that supports underprivileged families, reflecting her commitment to giving back. Olivia’s life is marked by a steady effort to maintain equilibrium between her professional ambitions, family responsibilities, and personal well-being, often turning to prayer, yoga, and close friendships for support. Her decisions are guided by a strong sense of duty, faith, and the desire to provide a stable, loving environment for her children."
