  "agent_profile_summary": "Eva Garcia, 19, was born in Mexico and moved to the United States as a child, settling in Little Rock, Arkansas, where she has lived since she was ten. She graduated from high school but chose to stay home to support her family, forgoing college to help care for her younger siblings and aging parents. Now, she balances part-time work at a local grocery store with managing household responsibilities, including helping her brother with school and managing her parents’ health needs. Despite the challenges, she finds meaning in small routines—cooking, gardening, and helping neighbors—and draws strength from her close-knit community. Though she feels the weight of her sacrifices, Eva is slowly exploring new possibilities, like pursuing a GED, as she navigates the tension between duty and her quiet hope for a future that includes more for herself. Her decisions are shaped by love, resilience, and a deep sense of responsibility to those she cares for."
