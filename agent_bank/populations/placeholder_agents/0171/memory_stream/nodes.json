Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAbby Schweighardt: I was born in Chicago, but I grew up in a small town in the East North Central region, where I lived with my parents and two younger siblings. My father is a teacher with a bachelor's degree, and my mother is a nurse who went back to school for her graduate degree when I was in high school. We were never really poor, but we weren't rolling in money either. My parents always emphasized education and hard work, which is why I ended up going to college right after high school. I studied sociology and later got my master's in public policy, which led me to my current job in nonprofit work focused on education equity. I got married a few years ago to my college sweetheart, and we live in Evanston now. Life hasn't been without its challenges\u2014my husband had a temporary illness a few months ago, which is why I'm not at work right now\u2014but overall, I feel lucky and grateful for the path I'm on.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAbby Schweighardt: Yes, there was definitely a crossroads moment for me\u2014right after I graduated from college. I had just finished my bachelor's in sociology and was trying to figure out what I wanted to do next. I had a few options: I could have gone into social work, which was something I had always been interested in, or I could have pursued a master's degree in public policy, which was a path my mother encouraged me to take because of her own experience in healthcare policy. I was torn because both paths felt meaningful, but I wasn't sure which one would give me the most impact. I remember sitting on my parents' porch one evening, staring at the lake, and thinking about what kind of life I wanted to build. I realized that if I wanted to work on systemic change, especially in education, a master's in public policy would give me the tools to do that more effectively. So I decided to go that route. That decision led me to my current work in nonprofit education equity, which is something I'm incredibly passionate about. Looking back, I don't think I would have made the same choice if I hadn't had the support of my family and the confidence to take a risk on my own path.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nAbby Schweighardt: I think for me, it was a conscious choice, but one that felt almost inevitable once I took the time to reflect. I wasn't just choosing between two careers\u2014I was choosing the kind of person I wanted to be. I remember talking to my mother that night, and she said something that stuck with me: 'You don't have to follow me, Abby, but you should follow what lights you up.' That made me realize that I wasn't just making a decision for my future, but also honoring the values my parents instilled in me. I didn't just 'fall into' public policy; I chose it because I believed in its potential to create real change. And even now, when I feel uncertain, I go back to that moment on the porch, looking at the lake, and remind myself why I made that choice.\n\n",

When I was deciding between social work and public policy, my mother was a huge support, but I also had a professor from my sociology classes who took me under her wing. She had worked in nonprofit education reform and saw potential in me. She invited me to a few meetings and introduced me to people in the field. That exposure was invaluable\u2014it helped me see the practical side of policy work and how it could directly impact students and schools. Without her guidance, I might have stayed in the more traditional social work path. It's amazing how one person's belief in you can open doors you didn't even know existed. I try to pay that forward now by mentoring students who are considering similar paths, because I know how much it meant to me.\n\n",

He was majoring in environmental science, and I was in sociology. We bonded over our shared passion for social justice and making the world a better place. We got married right after I finished my master's, and we've been together for almost six years now. We don't have any children yet, but we're both focused on building a stable foundation for our future. Daniel works as a sustainability consultant, so we're both pretty career-driven.

One of them is Priya, who I met during my first year of college. She was one of the first people to really challenge me intellectually and push me to think critically about the world. We became close during our sociology classes, and even though we went on different career paths\u2014she ended up in urban planning\u2014we still keep in touch and collaborate on projects related to community development. Another person who has had a big impact on my life is my college roommate, Emily.

But over time, I've come to appreciate the sense of community and the way people look out for each other here. I've never felt unsafe walking alone at night, even along the lakefront, which is something I used to worry about in more urban areas. The local police department is responsive, and there's a lot of neighborhood watch activity.

There are so many nonprofits and advocacy groups focused on education and social justice, which makes it easy to get involved and feel like I'm making a difference. That said, the cost of living here is definitely a challenge.

It was a stressful time for both of us, not just because of the uncertainty of his health, but also because it forced me to step into more responsibilities at home and adjust my own work schedule.

On one hand, I feel more grounded than ever in my work and my relationships. I've really come to appreciate the balance we've found in Evanston, and I've made some meaningful connections with colleagues and community members who share my passion for education equity. I've also grown a lot personally, especially through the experience of supporting Daniel during his illness. That time forced me to slow down and really reflect on what matters most in life. I've become more intentional about my time, my health, and the people I surround myself with. On the other hand, there's been a lot of stress, especially with the ongoing cost of living here and the pressure of trying to make an impact in my field.

There were moments when I felt overwhelmed and questioned my ability to handle everything.

What helped me was opening up to a therapist and learning coping strategies like mindfulness and journaling. I also found comfort in my faith and in the support of my friends and family. I've come to see anxiety not as something to be ashamed of, but as a sign that I need to slow down, take a breath, and remind myself that I'm not alone.

It's not just about the rituals or the traditions\u2014it's about the sense of community, the comfort of knowing I'm part of something larger than myself, and the values that guide me through both good times and difficult ones.

We also had some out-of-pocket medical costs related to Daniel's treatment, which added up over time.

I try to be careful with our spending, like meal-prepping on the weekends and using public transportation as much as possible to save on gas and car maintenance.

In the winter, our utility bills\u2014especially heating\u2014went up quite a bit, which was a challenge since we're already spending so much on rent. We also had higher grocery expenses during the holidays, partly because we like to host friends and family for dinner, and partly because of the general price increases we've seen in food and household items. When school started back up in the fall, we had to factor in more expenses for things like school supplies and extracurricular activities, even though we don't have kids yet. On the other hand, summer brought some relief in terms of lower heating costs, but we had to budget more for travel and outdoor activities, like visiting my in-laws in Wisconsin or going on weekend trips to Chicago.

It was a lot, but I needed the extra income to help with student loans and to save for our future.

That's from my salary as a policy analyst and Daniel's income as a sustainability consultant. It's not always consistent, especially with the fluctuations in project funding and consulting work, but it's enough to cover our expenses, save a little, and still enjoy the things that make life meaningful\u2014like weekend trips to the lake or a nice dinner out. I know it's not a huge amount, but it feels stable, and I'm grateful for the work we both do. It's also something I think about a lot, especially with the rising cost of living here in Evanston. I try to remind myself that we're not just working for money\u2014we're working to build a life that aligns with our values, and that gives me a sense of purpose even on the tougher days.\n\n",

The benefits package is pretty comprehensive\u2014health insurance covers both of us, which is a huge relief, especially given Daniel's recent health challenges. We also get paid time off, including vacation days and sick leave, which has been really important for maintaining balance. One of the things I appreciate most is the flexibility\u2014they allow remote work days, which helps me manage my schedule better, especially when I need to take care of Daniel or just recharge. There's also a retirement plan and some professional development opportunities, which I've taken advantage of to attend conferences and workshops. While the job can be demanding, the benefits and the sense of making a real difference in education equity make it all worthwhile.

I have a great relationship with my manager\u2014she's been a mentor to me since I started, and she's always encouraged me to take on new challenges and think critically about the policies we're working on. She's also very understanding of the balance between work and personal life, which is something I value a lot, especially given my own experiences. As for my coworkers, we have a strong sense of camaraderie. We're all passionate about education equity, and that shared mission makes it easy to collaborate and support each other. We have regular team meetings, and I think the open communication and mutual respect make our workplace feel like a community rather than just a job. There are definitely days when the work is stressful or the politics get complicated, but overall, I feel like I'm part of a team that genuinely cares about making a difference. That sense of connection is something I carry with me every day, and it reminds me why I chose this path in the first place.\n\n",

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nAbby Schweighardt: My work schedule is pretty flexible, which is both a blessing and a challenge. On most days, I have a general idea of when I need to be in the office or on a call, but there are also times when I can work from home or adjust my hours to fit around personal responsibilities. For example, if I need to run an errand or take care of something at home, I can usually shift a meeting or task to a different time. That flexibility has been especially helpful during times when Daniel needed more support, like when he was on leave. However, it can also be tricky because the lines between work and personal life can blur, especially when I'm deep in a project or dealing with a tight deadline. I've learned to set boundaries for myself, like designating specific times to check emails or work on reports, but it's something I'm still refining. Overall, I appreciate the flexibility because it allows me to be present for the people and things that matter most, even if it means sometimes working outside of traditional hours.\n\n",

It also made me think about how saving has become a habit for me\u2014not just for big goals like a home, but also for the little things that bring joy and security. Describing my work hours and the flexibility of my job brought back memories of how I've always balanced my passion for making a difference with the practicalities of life.

He also led extracurricular activities like the debate team and the science club, which I remember being really popular with the kids. He believed that every student had potential, and he worked hard to bring that out in them. My mother, on the other hand, was a nurse, and her most important duties involved caring for patients, especially in the emergency room. She was known for her compassion and dedication, and she often went above and beyond to make sure her patients felt heard and supported. Even when she was working long hours, she always made time for our family.
