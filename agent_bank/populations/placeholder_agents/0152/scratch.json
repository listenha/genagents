  "agent_profile_summary": "Vince Patel, a 42-year-old software engineer living in Edison, New Jersey, moved to the U.S. from Mumbai at age ten, navigating the challenges of a new language and culture while excelling academically. A pivotal moment came in high school when his English teacher, Ms. Thompson, encouraged him to embrace his potential, leading him to join the math club and pursue engineering, a path he has followed for over a decade. Now, he balances his full-time job with volunteering at the local library, where he mentors students and shares his knowledge. His life is shaped by a commitment to growth and connection, whether through his roots in Hindu traditions, his efforts to support his family in India, or his quiet routines of cooking traditional meals and evening walks. Vince’s journey reflects a steady movement from feeling like an outsider to finding purpose in community, education, and the small, meaningful choices that anchor him to both his heritage and his present."
