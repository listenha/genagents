Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nVince Patel: I was born in Mumbai, India, to a middle-class family. My father was a schoolteacher with a bachelor's degree, and my mother didn't have much formal education, but she was always supportive of my learning. We moved to the United States when I was about ten years old, settling in Edison, New Jersey. It was a big adjustment for me, especially since I had to learn English quickly and navigate a new culture. I remember feeling out of place at first, but I was determined to fit in. I excelled in school, especially in math and science, and I worked hard to earn scholarships for college. I eventually got my bachelor's degree in engineering from a university in New Jersey, which helped me land a full-time job in the tech industry. I've never married and have always focused on my career and personal growth. Even though I've faced financial challenges, I've always believed in working hard and staying true to my roots. Being a Hindu has been a big part of my identity, and I still celebrate festivals with my family back in India whenever I can.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nVince Patel: Yes, there was a defining moment that shaped the course of my life. It happened when I was around sixteen, just after we moved to Edison. I was struggling in high school, not just academically but socially as well. I felt like an outsider, and I was frustrated that I couldn't connect with my peers the way I wanted to. One day, my English teacher, Ms. Thompson, noticed I was quiet in class and pulled me aside after school. She asked me about my interests and what I wanted to do with my life. I told her I loved math and science, but I didn't see a future for myself in the U.S. She looked at me and said, 'You have a brain that can solve problems, Vince. Don't let your past define your future.' That conversation stayed with me. I started to take her advice seriously. I joined the school's math club, started volunteering at a local community center to improve my English, and began setting goals for myself. That moment was the crossroads\u2014I could have continued feeling lost and resentful, or I could take control of my destiny. I chose the latter, and it changed everything. It was the push I needed to work harder, to believe in myself, and to eventually pursue a career in engineering. I still think about that conversation with Ms. Thompson often. It was the turning point that made me who I am today.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nVince Patel: I think it was a conscious choice, but one that felt inevitable once I had that conversation with Ms. Thompson. I wasn't just deciding to work harder\u2014I was deciding to believe in a future that I hadn't yet seen for myself. It wasn't just about academics; it was about identity, about proving to myself that I belonged here. I remember walking home that day, feeling a weight lift off my shoulders, like I had been given a map to a place I didn't know existed. I made a decision then and there to stop letting my past hold me back, to stop seeing myself as an outsider. I chose to embrace the challenges, to see them as opportunities to grow. That choice wasn't just about my education\u2014it was about who I wanted to become, and I've been following that path ever since.\n\n",

She didn't just see me as a student who was struggling\u2014she saw potential. But I also think the community center where I volunteered played a role. It gave me a space to practice English with people who were also trying to find their place here. There were other immigrants, kids from different backgrounds, and we all shared the same struggle of adapting. I don't know if I would have had the confidence to take that next step without those people around me. Organizations that support immigrants and first-generation students are so important. They provide the resources and the encouragement that many of us need to feel like we belong. I wish I had known about more of those programs earlier, but I'm grateful for the ones I did access. They helped me build the foundation I needed to succeed.\n\n",

We stay in touch through phone calls and video chats, especially during festivals like Diwali and Holi.

I've always valued family, and even though I've chosen to focus on my career and personal growth, I know that my family has been a constant source of support throughout my life.

One of them is Carlos, a coworker I met early in my career at the tech company I work for. We bonded over our shared love of problem-solving and late-night coffee runs. He's been a great mentor and has helped me navigate the challenges of working in a competitive industry. Then there's Aisha, a friend from the community center I volunteered at back in high school. We lost touch for a while, but I reconnected with her a few years ago\u2014she's now a social worker in Newark, and she's been a huge inspiration to me.

There are a few small businesses on the main street\u2014like a local bakery, a hardware store, and a community library that I actually volunteer at on weekends. It's a friendly place, and I've made a few good friends through the library. I like the sense of community here, even though it's not as diverse as I remember Mumbai being. Still, there are a few other Indian families in the area, and we often get together for cultural events or festivals. I find it comforting to have that connection, even if it's not the same as back home. My apartment is modest, but it's cozy and feels like a home. I've decorated it with some photos of my family and a few souvenirs from my trips back to India. It's not much, but it's enough for me.

There are always people out and about, especially in the evenings, and the local businesses add to the sense of community.

On the positive side, the sense of community is something I really appreciate. I mentioned the library\u2014I've found a lot of purpose in volunteering there, and it's given me a way to give back to the people around me. It's also nice to have a stable job and a place to call home, even if it's not extravagant. I've built a life that's comfortable, and I'm proud of that. But there are downs too. Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in a routine, working long hours and not having much time for anything else. I miss the vibrancy of Mumbai\u2014the energy, the food, the culture.

I start my week on Monday with a routine\u2014waking up early, having a quick breakfast of idli and chutney, and heading to work. My job in tech keeps me busy most of the day, but I try to take short breaks to recharge, usually with a cup of chai or a quick walk outside.

I don't have any major chronic conditions, but I've learned the importance of taking care of myself, especially as I've gotten older. I used to be pretty sedentary, especially during my early years in tech when I was working long hours and sitting at my desk for most of the day. That started taking a toll on me\u2014my back would ache, and I'd feel sluggish by the end of the day. A few years ago, I decided to make some changes. I started going for regular walks, especially in the evenings, which has helped with my energy levels and overall mood. I also try to eat a balanced diet, though it's not always easy with my busy schedule. I've made an effort to cook more at home, especially traditional Indian meals, which are usually healthier than the fast food I used to rely on. I've also started seeing a doctor regularly for check-ups, which is something I didn't used to prioritize. I think it's important to be proactive about health, especially when you're living a life that's full of responsibilities and goals. I've also taken up yoga a few times a week, mostly online classes, which has helped with flexibility and stress relief. It's not perfect, but I've come to realize that small, consistent habits can make a big difference over time. I hope to keep this up and maybe even get into some strength training in the future.

It's easier to stay on track when these habits are woven into my schedule rather than something I have to force myself to do. What makes it harder, though, is the long hours at work and the occasional tendency to skip meals or rely on convenience food when I'm too busy. I've noticed that when I'm stressed or overwhelmed, I tend to neglect my health, which is something I'm still learning to manage. I think the key is balance\u2014finding ways to take care of myself without letting my responsibilities completely take over.

I noticed that the pain would flare up after a long day at the desk, and sometimes it would even wake me up at night.

I've had days where the pain was so bad that I had to take a break from work and just rest for a while, but I've learned to listen to my body now. I think the biggest challenge has been adjusting my mindset\u2014from seeing health as something I could ignore until it became a problem, to now viewing it as something I need to actively maintain. It's not always easy, especially when you're used to pushing through discomfort, but I've come to realize that taking care of myself isn't a luxury\u2014it's a necessity. I don't want to be in a situation where my health becomes a barrier to the life I've built here. That's why I'm making these changes now, even if they seem small. It's about being proactive, not reactive, and I'm committed to that path.\n\n",

There have been moments of growth, like when I finally started seeing a chiropractor for my back pain and realized how much I had been neglecting my body. It's been a reminder that even in the busiest of times, I need to take care of myself. I've also felt a deep sense of connection to my roots, especially after visiting India last year for Diwali. Being surrounded by family, hearing the familiar sounds of the city, and sharing meals with my grandmother made me feel like I was exactly where I was meant to be. At the same time, I've been working on finding more balance in my life\u2014setting aside time for hobbies, like photography, and making sure I'm not just going through the motions. I've also started mentoring a few high school students at the library, which has been incredibly rewarding. It's strange, but I feel like I'm finally starting to understand what it means to truly belong\u2014not just in a place, but in a life that feels meaningful and whole.\n\n",

I used to think of health as something that would take care of itself, but now I see it as something I need to actively nurture. The back pain I've been dealing with over the past few years was a wake-up call\u2014I realized that I couldn't ignore my body any longer. It forced me to make changes, like investing in an ergonomic chair, stretching more, and being more mindful of my posture. These small adjustments have made a big difference, and I'm grateful for the reminder that taking care of myself isn't just about avoiding problems\u2014it's about creating a life that feels whole and sustainable. I've also come to appreciate the importance of balance, especially in a career that can be demanding and all-consuming. I'm learning to prioritize my health without feeling guilty, and that's something I didn't used to think about. It's a journey, and I'm still figuring things out, but I'm glad I've started.",

There were times, especially in my early years here, when I felt like I was constantly trying to prove myself\u2014both to others and to myself. I remember feeling a deep sense of loneliness, not because I didn't have people around me, but because I felt like I was always on the outside looking in. That sense of being an outsider, of not fully belonging, can be exhausting. But over time, I've learned to find peace in the small things\u2014the warmth of a family video call, the rhythm of my daily routine, the quiet moments of reflection.

Being Hindu, I grew up with a deep respect for tradition, and even though I live in the U.S. now, I still find comfort in the rituals and values that have been passed down through my family. My parents made sure that I understood the importance of festivals like Diwali and Holi, not just as cultural events, but as moments of reflection and renewal. I still light a diya every Diwali, even if it's just in my small apartment, and I take time to pray or meditate in the morning, even if it's just for a few minutes. It's not about being religious in the strictest sense, but more about staying connected to my roots and finding peace in the chaos of everyday life. I think spirituality, for me, is about mindfulness\u2014being present, being grateful, and carrying the lessons of my heritage with me wherever I go. It's something that has helped me through difficult times, and I hope to pass that sense of inner peace on to others, especially the kids I mentor at the library.\n\n",

In addition to my full-time job as a software engineer, I've been taking on some freelance projects, mostly in the evenings or on weekends. These are usually short-term contracts where I help small businesses develop simple web applications or fix bugs in their existing systems. It's not always the most exciting work, but it gives me a sense of flexibility and keeps my skills sharp. I also do some part-time tutoring at the library, especially during the school year, where I help high school students with math and computer science. It's a way to give back, and I find it rewarding to see them grow and gain confidence. I know it's not the most conventional path, but for someone like me\u2014someone who's still building a life in a new country\u2014it's about making the most of every opportunity, no matter how small.\n\n",

It's interesting how managing stress and worry has become a part of my daily routine, just like budgeting and saving. I used to think of these things as separate parts of my life\u2014work, health, money\u2014but now I see them as connected threads that shape my overall sense of balance. Learning to prioritize self-care, like journaling before bed or volunteering at the library, has helped me feel more grounded, especially when I'm dealing with the pressures of work and money. At the same time, being mindful of my expenses and trying to save even small amounts each month gives me a sense of control and security. I've come to realize that it's not about having everything perfect, but about finding small, consistent ways to take care of myself and my future. These reflections have helped me appreciate the progress I've made, even if I'm still learning and growing every day.",

That comes from my full-time job as a software engineer and the freelance work I do on the side. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover my expenses and save a little for the future. I've always believed in working hard and being responsible with money, especially since I grew up in a middle-class family in India where every rupee counted. I try to live within my means, and I've learned that even small savings can add up over time. I also make sure to set aside a portion of my income for emergencies or unexpected expenses, just in case.

The company offers a solid benefits package, which includes health insurance, dental coverage, and vision care. That's been a relief, especially since I started seeing a chiropractor for my back pain\u2014it's reassuring to know that some of those costs are covered. We also get paid time off, which includes vacation days, sick leave, and holidays. I usually take a week off during the summer, which I use to visit India or plan trips back home. The company is pretty flexible with remote work, which has been helpful during times when I've needed to adjust my schedule for personal reasons.

He's not the kind of boss who micromanages\u2014he trusts his team to do the work and focuses more on results than on the process. As for my coworkers, we have a good rapport. We're all in the same boat, dealing with tight deadlines and complex projects, so there's a sense of camaraderie. We often grab lunch together or chat during breaks, and I've formed some really good friendships over the years.

That said, there are times when I need to stay late or work from home, especially when we're launching a new feature or fixing a critical bug. The company is pretty flexible about it, which I appreciate. I've learned to set boundaries for myself, like making sure I leave work at 5 p.m. unless it's absolutely necessary.

He had a bachelor's degree, which was quite an achievement for someone from our background at the time. His job was stable, but not highly paid, and he often had to work extra hours to support our family. I remember seeing him grade papers late into the night or prepare lesson plans during the weekends. He always emphasized the importance of education, which is why I was encouraged to study hard from a young age. My mother, on the other hand, didn't have a formal job for most of my childhood. She managed the household and took care of my younger siblings, which was a huge responsibility. I know now that she gave up a lot to ensure my brother and I had the opportunities she didn't.

But what I remember most was how he treated his students.

He would often stay late after school to help students who were struggling, and he even took on extra responsibilities like organizing math competitions and mentoring students who wanted to pursue higher education. He didn't make a lot of money, but he always said that the satisfaction of seeing his students succeed was more valuable than any salary.
