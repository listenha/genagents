  "agent_profile_summary": "Mikayla Chandler, a 33-year-old community outreach coordinator in Seattle, grew up in the Philippines before moving to the U.S. at age five, where her parents worked multiple jobs to make ends meet. Her decision to leave home at 17 to pursue a community college scholarship marked a pivotal turning point, setting her on a path to graduate school and a career supporting immigrant families through her nonprofit work. Now married with a two-year-old daughter, she balances her role as a mother with her commitment to advocacy, often reflecting on her own childhood struggles to inform her approach. Her sustained dedication to community support and her awareness of systemic barriers shape her empathetic, action-oriented mindset, as she navigates the ongoing tension between personal stability and the desire to uplift others."
