    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMikayla Chandler: I was born in the Philippines, but I moved to the United States when I was just five years old. My family settled in Seattle, Washington, and I grew up in a small apartment on the outskirts of the city. My parents worked hard to make ends meet\u2014my father was a mechanic, and my mother worked part-time at a local grocery store. We didn't have much, but we always had each other. I remember my childhood as being full of laughter, even though we struggled financially. I was a quiet kid, more interested in books than playing outside, which probably explains why I ended up pursuing education so seriously. I went to a public high school, and though the resources were limited, I was determined to get into a good university. I eventually earned a graduate degree in public policy, which has helped me in my current job as a community outreach coordinator for a nonprofit that supports immigrant families. I met my husband, David, while I was in graduate school\u2014he was a fellow volunteer at the same organization. We got married a few years ago, and we now have a two-year-old daughter, Lily. Life hasn't been easy, but I've always believed in working hard and making the most of the opportunities I've been given.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMikayla Chandler: Yes, there was a moment that changed everything for me. I was 17, still in high school, and I had just received a scholarship to a community college. It was the first time I felt like I had a real shot at something bigger. But at the same time, my father was laid off from his job, and we were barely getting by. My parents were worried about how we would afford the tuition and the expenses that came with it. I remember sitting at the kitchen table, staring at the scholarship letter, feeling both excited and terrified. I didn't want to leave my family behind, but I also knew that staying in Seattle without any real education would limit my future. I talked it over with my mother, who had always encouraged me to pursue my dreams, even when we didn't have much. She reminded me that I had worked hard in school and that this was an opportunity I couldn't let slip away. That night, I made the decision to take the scholarship and move to a different city for college. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, but it was also the best. That choice led me to meet people who shaped my worldview, to study public policy, and ultimately to the work I do today. Looking back, I realize that moment was the turning point that set me on the path to the life I have now.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nMikayla Chandler: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made easily. I had to weigh so many things\u2014my family's needs, my own dreams, the uncertainty of moving away. But in the end, I realized that I couldn't let fear or hardship dictate my future. I made a plan, talked it through with my mother, and committed to making it work. I didn't just 'fall into' this path; I chose it, even when it felt like a leap of faith. That decision taught me the value of agency and the importance of believing in yourself, even when the world around you feels uncertain.\n\n",

I think if I had known about more resources or had someone to talk to about my options, it might have made the decision easier. At the time, I didn't really know where to turn for guidance\u2014my parents were doing their best, but they didn't have the experience to help me navigate the college application process. If there had been a mentor or a community organization that could have offered support, like financial aid counseling or career planning, I think it would have made a huge difference. In fact, that's why I now volunteer with the nonprofit I work for. I want to make sure that other young people, especially those from similar backgrounds, don't have to make that decision alone. It's not just about getting into college\u2014it's about having the tools and support to make the right choice for your future.\n\n",

I married David when I was 28, and we met through our volunteer work at the nonprofit where I now work as a community outreach coordinator. David is a teacher at a local middle school, and he's been incredibly supportive of my career and my goals. We have a two-year-old daughter named Lily, who is the light of our lives. She's a curious and energetic child, and I love watching her explore the world with such wonder. Having a family has given me a new perspective on the work I do\u2014especially with immigrant families, many of whom are navigating the same challenges I did. It reminds me every day why it's so important to advocate for accessible education and support systems. My parents are still in Seattle, and though we don't see them as often as we'd like, they're a big part of our lives. My mother, in particular, has been my biggest supporter throughout my life, and I'm grateful for her strength and wisdom.\n\n",

It was also humbling to reflect on how much support I needed back then and how I now strive to give that same support to others through my work. Sharing my story with someone else, especially in such depth, made me realize how important it is to not only remember where I came from but also to use that experience to help others find their way.

We were very close growing up, even though we didn't have much. He always had a creative streak, and I remember how he would draw pictures on the walls of our apartment when he was a kid\u2014something my parents never really stopped us from doing. We haven't always seen eye to eye, especially when he was younger and wanted to take a different path than what I thought was practical, but over time, I've come to admire his independence and passion. He's someone who never lets fear hold him back, and I think that's something I've learned from him as much as he's learned from me. We still keep in touch, and I'm proud of the person he's become. He's also been a big support to me in my work, offering to design materials for the nonprofit I work with.

One of them is Sarah, a fellow volunteer at the nonprofit I work for. We met during a community event, and we've been close ever since. She's a social worker with a passion for immigrant rights, and her work has inspired me in so many ways. We often collaborate on projects, and she's been a great sounding board for my ideas. Then there's my mentor, Mr. Thompson, who was the director of the nonprofit when I first started working there. He saw potential in me and took me under his wing, offering guidance and encouragement when I was still finding my footing. His belief in me gave me the confidence to take on more responsibilities and eventually move into my current role. I also have a few close friends from college who I still keep in touch with, even though life has taken us in different directions. They've been there for me through both good times and bad, and I'm grateful for their friendship.

It's a bit of a contrast to where I grew up\u2014back then, we were in a quieter, more working-class area on the outskirts of the city. Capitol Hill is more urban, with a lot of small businesses, coffee shops, and community centers. I love that there's always something going on, whether it's a local art show, a food festival, or a neighborhood meeting. It's a place where people from all walks of life come together, which feels very in line with the work I do. My apartment is in a building with other young professionals and families like mine, and it's nice to feel part of a community that values inclusivity and support.

That said, I'm not na\u00efve\u2014I know that safety can be relative, and there are parts of the city where people don't feel as secure. For me, though, the mix of cultures, the presence of local organizations that support vulnerable populations, and the fact that I've built a life here with my family make me feel grounded. I also take precautions, like being aware of my surroundings and trusting my instincts.

There's always something new to learn or experience, and I feel like I'm part of a bigger movement toward inclusivity and support for people from all backgrounds.

The cost of living here is high, and even with my job, it can be stressful trying to balance my income with rent, groceries, and my daughter's needs. I also sometimes feel the weight of being an immigrant in a city that, while welcoming, still has its own set of barriers. There are days when I miss the simplicity of my childhood in Seattle's outskirts, where life was slower and the relationships were more tightly knit. But I remind myself that I'm here for a reason\u2014to build a better future for my daughter and to help others who are still finding their way.

It started becoming more noticeable a year ago, and I finally made an appointment with a physical therapist. They diagnosed me with mild lumbar strain, which they said was likely from poor posture and lack of core strength. It's been a bit of a wake-up call for me to take my physical health more seriously.

I think the biggest challenge was adjusting my mindset\u2014from seeing my body as something I could push through to seeing it as something I need to take care of. It's not always easy, but I'm grateful for the reminder that my health is a foundation for everything else in my life, including my ability to support my family and do the work I love.\n\n",

Becoming a mother has changed me in ways I never anticipated. There's this constant love and joy that comes with watching Lily grow, but there's also this deep sense of responsibility that can be overwhelming. I've had moments where I feel like I'm not doing enough, like I'm not giving her the perfect life or being the perfect parent.

There were moments when I felt like I wasn't enough, like I had to work twice as hard to be seen or accepted. Now, as a mother and a professional, that anxiety still shows up, but in different ways. It's not about proving myself anymore\u2014it's about making sure I'm doing the best I can for Lily and the people I work with. I've learned to recognize when that anxiety is creeping in, and I try to address it through mindfulness, talking to friends, or even just taking a few deep breaths when things feel overwhelming.

Growing up, my family wasn't particularly religious, and I never felt the need to define my identity through a specific faith. That said, I do believe in something bigger than myself\u2014whether it's the resilience of the human spirit, the power of community, or the idea that we all have a role to play in making the world a better place. I think of my work with immigrant families as a kind of spiritual practice, one that's rooted in compassion, empathy, and service. It's not about believing in a higher power, but about believing in the connections we build with one another and the impact we can have on each other's lives. I also find meaning in small, everyday moments\u2014like watching Lily laugh, or seeing someone I've helped find their way in this country.

There are times when I feel overwhelmed with work or parenting challenges, and seeing others share similar struggles helps me feel less alone.

Groceries are another big one\u2014especially since I try to buy organic and healthy foods for Lily, which can be pricey.

For example, during the winter months, our heating bill went up quite a bit, and we had to adjust our budget to cover that. We also had to pay for some unexpected repairs in the apartment, like a leaky pipe that needed fixing. Then there were the holidays\u2014Christmas and Hanukkah, even though we don't celebrate the latter, we still wanted to make it special for Lily. We ended up spending a bit more on gifts and decorations, which wasn't in our original budget. On the flip side, when school started back up in the fall, we had to pay for some new supplies and clothes for Lily, which added to our expenses. But when school ended, we had a bit more flexibility with our budget. I've also noticed that our grocery bills tend to be higher in the summer when we buy more fresh produce and try to eat out less. It's been a learning experience, really, to stay flexible and not get too rigid with our finances. I've started setting aside a small emergency fund now, just in case something unexpected comes up.

I've come to understand that taking care of my mental and financial health is just as important as the work I do for others, and I'm learning to be more intentional about both.",

That includes my full-time salary from the nonprofit, and David's income from his teaching job. It's actually a bit higher than usual because David got a small raise at the start of the year, and I also received a performance bonus for the work we did with the immigrant families during the pandemic. It's nice to have a little extra, but I still have to be careful with how we spend it. I've been trying to use that extra money to build up our emergency fund a bit more, just in case something unexpected comes up. It's reassuring to know that we're not just surviving, but we're actually making some progress financially. It's not a lot, but every little bit helps, especially when you're trying to provide for a family and do work that matters.\n\n",

When I first started, I was still figuring out my role and how to best support the families we work with. Over time, I've grown into my position and taken on more responsibilities, like leading our outreach initiatives and mentoring new staff members. The benefits of the job are pretty standard for a nonprofit\u2014health insurance is a big one, which I'm really grateful for, especially since I've been dealing with my back pain. We also get paid time off, including vacation days and sick leave, which is something I used a lot when Lily was born and during her first few months. The workplace culture is very supportive, and there's a strong sense of mission that keeps everyone motivated. I think what makes this job special is that we're not just doing work for a paycheck\u2014we're making a real difference in people's lives, and that gives me a deep sense of purpose every day.\n\n",

I have a great relationship with my manager, Mr. Thompson, who has been a mentor to me since I started. He's always encouraged me to take on new challenges and has given me the freedom to grow into my role. I feel like he genuinely cares about the people we serve and the impact of our work, which aligns with my own values. As for my coworkers, we have a strong sense of camaraderie. We're all passionate about what we do, and there's a lot of collaboration and mutual support. We often have team meetings where we share updates, challenges, and successes, and it's comforting to know that I'm not alone in the work we do. I've formed close friendships with a few of my colleagues, and we often check in with each other, both professionally and personally. It's rare to find a workplace that feels like a community, but that's exactly what 'Seattle Bridges' is for me. It makes the long hours and the stress of the job more bearable, knowing that I'm surrounded by people who are just as committed to making a difference as I am.\n\n",

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nMikayla Chandler: My work schedule is pretty predictable, but there's definitely some flexibility depending on the needs of the organization and the families we serve. Most weeks, I follow a standard 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. schedule, but I often stay late if we're wrapping up a project or if someone needs extra support. I also have some flexibility in how I manage my time\u2014like if I need to leave a bit early to pick up Lily from daycare or if I have to attend a community meeting in the evening. That said, there are times when the schedule can feel less predictable, especially when we're planning events or responding to urgent needs in the community. I appreciate the flexibility it gives me to balance work and family, but I also know that it can sometimes make it harder to separate work from personal time. It's a trade-off I'm willing to make, though, because the work we do is so meaningful, and I want to be fully present for both my job and my family.\n\n",

At the same time, I'm always thinking about the future\u2014like how we'll afford college for Lily, or if we'll ever be able to buy a home. It's not that I don't trust my ability to work hard, but sometimes I wonder if we'll ever feel truly secure. Still, I try not to let that worry consume me.

My father worked as a mechanic at a local auto shop, and he was always on his feet, fixing cars and dealing with the physical demands of the job. He didn't have much formal education, but he was incredibly skilled and dedicated. My mother worked part-time at a grocery store, often taking shifts in the evenings or on weekends.

I remember her working long hours, sometimes coming home exhausted, but she always made sure we had food on the table and a roof over our heads. Their work was essential for our survival, and I've always been grateful for their sacrifices.

He spent most of his days in the garage, fixing cars, replacing parts, and making sure vehicles were running smoothly. His most important duties included diagnosing mechanical issues, performing oil changes, and doing repairs that required both strength and precision. He didn't have a lot of formal training, but he was self-taught in many ways, learning through experience and the guidance of his coworkers. He always had his hands dirty, and I remember coming home from school to find him covered in grease, laughing with my mother as he told stories about the day's work. My mother, on the other hand, worked in the grocery store, mostly in the produce section. Her most important activities involved stocking shelves, helping customers find what they needed, and making sure the store was clean and organized. She worked long hours, often coming home tired, but she always made time to cook dinner and help with homework.

The shop was pretty basic\u2014just a few bays, tools spread out on tables, and a lot of grease and oil. They mostly serviced older cars, which meant my father had to be really skilled at figuring out what was wrong with them, often with limited resources. He didn't make a lot of money, but he was respected in the community for his work. My mother worked at a local grocery store that was part of a larger chain, but the store itself was small and had a tight-knit staff. She was responsible for the produce section, which meant she had to be up early every morning to restock, check for spoiled items, and make sure everything was fresh for the customers. She didn't make a lot either, but she always found ways to stretch our food budget and make sure we had enough to eat. Looking back, I realize how much they gave up to provide for us, and it's one of the reasons I'm so passionate about helping immigrant families who are in similar situations. It's a cycle I want to break for others, just as they broke it for me.\n\n",

I hope Lily is growing into a curious, compassionate, and resilient person, someone who knows her worth and isn't afraid to dream big.
