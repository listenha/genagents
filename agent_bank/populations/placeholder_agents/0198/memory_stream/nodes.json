Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nElizabeth Carlsen: I was born in Massachusetts, in a small town in New England, and I grew up in a close-knit family. My parents were both very involved in my life\u2014my father worked as a teacher, and my mother was a nurse. We weren't wealthy, but we had a comfortable life, and I always felt supported. I remember my mother reading to me every night, and my father encouraging me to ask questions about everything. I went to a public school, and I was pretty lucky to have some amazing teachers who really inspired me. I was always interested in literature and social issues, which probably explains why I ended up leaning more towards liberal politics as I grew older. I went to college in Boston, where I met my husband, and we've been together ever since. Life hasn't been without its challenges, but I feel like I've been lucky to have a stable family, a good education, and a career that I enjoy. I'm still figuring out what the next chapter will bring, but I'm grateful for where I am.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nElizabeth Carlsen: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped my path. I was in my second year of college, studying English literature, and I had the opportunity to take a summer internship with a nonprofit that worked with immigrant families in Boston. I had always been interested in social justice, but that experience opened my eyes to the real struggles people face when they come to this country seeking a better life. I remember one particular family\u2014parents who had left their home country under difficult circumstances, trying to give their children a chance they didn't have. I saw how language barriers, lack of resources, and systemic challenges affected their daily lives. That summer, I realized that I wanted to use my skills not just for personal fulfillment, but to help others. It was then that I decided to pursue a career in community advocacy, even though I had initially thought I would go into teaching or writing. That choice led me to meet my husband, who was working with the same organization at the time, and it ultimately shaped the kind of person I am today\u2014someone who believes in using her voice and her education to make a difference in her community.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nElizabeth Carlsen: I think for me, it was a conscious choice, but one that felt inevitable once I had that experience. I remember sitting in my dorm room that summer, thinking about everything I had seen and how it contrasted with my own life. I had always been lucky, and I realized I didn't want to just live a comfortable life\u2014I wanted to do something that mattered. I remember telling my parents that night, and my mother just looked at me and said, 'If you're going to do this, you have to be ready to fight for it.' That stuck with me. It wasn't just about changing my career path; it was about changing how I saw myself and my role in the world. I didn't just choose advocacy\u2014I chose to be someone who would stand up for others, even when it was hard.\n\n",

I think the internship program itself was a lifeline for me\u2014it gave me the opportunity to step outside my academic bubble and see the world through someone else's eyes. But I also think my parents played a role in helping me feel confident enough to make that choice. My mother, in particular, had always been a strong advocate for others in her work as a nurse, and she modeled that kind of compassion and courage for me. I also remember talking to a mentor at the nonprofit, a woman named Maria, who had come to the U.S. as a teenager and built a life here through sheer determination. She was the one who encouraged me to see my education not just as a personal achievement, but as a tool I could use to help others. Without that support system\u2014both personal and professional\u2014I don't think I would have had the clarity or the courage to take that step.\n\n",

He was a community organizer at the time, and we bonded over our shared passion for social justice. We got married a few years later, after we both finished our graduate studies. We've been together for over a decade now, and we have two children\u2014Emma, who's eight, and Liam, who's five. They're both in public school, just like I was, and I try to instill in them the same values my parents gave me: curiosity, kindness, and a sense of responsibility to others. Daniel and I both work full time, but we make it a priority to be present for our kids. We live in Cambridge now, not too far from where I grew up, and I love that our kids are growing up in a city that's both vibrant and full of opportunities. It's not always easy balancing work and family life, but I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\n",

She's been a constant source of wisdom and encouragement, especially when I was starting out in advocacy work. Then there's my best friend, Sarah, who I met in college.

It's a walkable area, which I love, especially with the kids. We're close to the Harvard campus, which gives the neighborhood a kind of academic energy, but it's also very community-focused.

I know a lot of the people who live around us, and there's a general sense of looking out for one another. That said, like any urban area, there are parts of the city that feel less safe, especially at night or in certain areas.

One of the things I love most is the sense of community\u2014there are so many people who are engaged in local causes, from neighborhood clean-ups to supporting small businesses. It's inspiring to see that kind of collective effort. That said, the cost of living here is definitely a strain. We're lucky to have a stable income, but I know a lot of people in our neighborhood are struggling to afford housing or even basic necessities. It's something I think about often, especially as I work in community advocacy. I want to make sure that the kind of support I received growing up is available to others, no matter where they live.

I work full time at a nonprofit that focuses on immigrant and refugee integration, so my days are often spent meeting with clients, organizing community events, and collaborating with other organizations. Mondays are usually the busiest, with meetings and planning for the week ahead. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are more about direct service\u2014meeting with families, helping them navigate resources, and sometimes even translating for those who don't speak English well. Thursdays are often a mix of both, and I try to reserve Fridays for something a bit more relaxed, like picking up the kids from school or going to the park. On weekends, we usually have family time\u2014Sunday mornings are for church, and then we have a big family lunch. Daniel and I also try to take the kids to a museum or a cultural event once a month.

It's funny, because I used to think of mindfulness as something 'new age' or only for people with a lot of time, but now I see it as a necessary tool for someone like me who juggles so many responsibilities. I also started setting aside 15 minutes each evening to journal about my day\u2014just a few thoughts, things I'm grateful for, or even frustrations I want to process.

It started around the time I was leading a major initiative at work to expand our services to more families in the community. The stress was intense, and I didn't realize how much it was affecting my body until I ended up in the doctor's office with a migraine that lasted for three days.

But what I realized was that taking care of myself isn't just about being present for others\u2014it's about being able to show up for them in a way that's sustainable.

The work I do has been both fulfilling and exhausting, especially with the ongoing challenges in our community. I've seen more families struggling than ever before, and it's weighed on me in ways I didn't expect. At the same time, I've also felt a deep sense of connection with my family, especially with my kids. They've grown so much, and watching them navigate school, friendships, and their own little challenges has been both heartwarming and humbling. I've also been trying to be more present in my own life, whether it's through mindfulness, journaling, or just taking a few minutes to breathe. I think I've learned that life isn't about being perfect\u2014it's about showing up, even when it's hard. And I'm trying to do that, every day.\n\n",

The recent changes I've made, like incorporating mindfulness and journaling into my routine, have helped me feel more balanced and grounded.

How about for you?\n\nElizabeth Carlsen: I think I've struggled with anxiety in the past, especially during times when I felt overwhelmed by work or personal responsibilities. It's something I didn't always talk about openly, but I've come to realize that it's a part of me, just like anyone else's struggles. I used to feel like I had to be strong all the time, like showing vulnerability was a weakness. But over the years, I've learned that asking for help is a sign of strength, not a flaw. I started seeing a therapist a few years ago, and that's been incredibly helpful. It's allowed me to process my thoughts and emotions in a healthier way, and it's also helped me understand that it's okay to not be okay all the time. I think the hardest part is still learning to be kind to myself when I'm feeling down, but I'm getting better at it.

He's been under a lot of pressure, but he's learning to manage it better, partly because he's seen me try to do the same. Our kids have been adjusting to the changes in their routines, especially with school being more demanding as they get older. Emma, in particular, has been dealing with some social pressures at school, which has been tough to watch. I've had to have some really honest conversations with her about kindness, standing up for herself, and knowing when to ask for help. Liam, on the other hand, has been more resilient\u2014he just seems to roll with whatever comes his way. As a family, we've been trying to make time for each other, even when it's hard.

How about you?\n\nElizabeth Carlsen: For me, religion has always been an important part of my life, though I wouldn't say it's the only thing that defines me. I was raised Catholic, and my parents made sure that faith was woven into our daily lives\u2014whether through Sunday Mass, family prayers before meals, or the values we were taught about kindness, forgiveness, and service to others. Even now, as an adult, I find comfort in my faith, especially during difficult times. It's not just about going to church or following rituals; it's about the sense of community and belonging that comes with being part of a faith tradition. I've always believed that faith is about connecting with something bigger than yourself, and that has guided me in both my personal and professional life. I try to live by the teachings I was raised with\u2014treating others with compassion, standing up for what's right, and being grateful for the blessings I have. My children were baptized and attend Sunday school, and I hope they grow up with the same sense of purpose and connection that I've had. Of course, I know that not everyone shares my beliefs, and I respect that. But for me, faith is a grounding force, and I'm grateful for the role it has played in shaping who I am.\n\n",

I used to be on Facebook more regularly, mostly to stay in touch with family and old friends, but over the years, I've found that it can be more of a distraction than a connection. I've noticed that the more I scroll, the more I compare my life to others, and that doesn't always feel good. I've also been conscious of how social media can sometimes spread misinformation or create division, especially around political issues, which is something I care deeply about. Instead of spending time on platforms, I prefer to connect in person\u2014whether it's through my neighborhood group meetings, family dinners, or even just a coffee with a friend. I do follow a few accounts related to my work, like organizations that focus on immigrant rights or mental health advocacy, but I keep it minimal.

There were times when I felt like I was constantly on edge, trying to balance everything without burning out. But I've been working on my emotional coping strategies, and it's been a process. I've started setting clearer boundaries between work and home life, which has helped me feel more in control.

Rent is always the largest chunk of our budget\u2014Cambridge is expensive, and even though we're in a more affordable part of the city, it still takes up about a third of our income. Childcare is another major cost, especially since we both work full time. We use a combination of in-home care and after-school programs, which adds up quickly. Groceries are also a significant expense, especially since we try to eat healthy and support local businesses. We also have some regular bills like car payments, insurance, and utilities. It's a tight budget, but we've learned to prioritize what matters most\u2014like making sure the kids have what they need and that we can still contribute to our community through volunteering and advocacy work. I think the biggest challenge is balancing all of that while still trying to save for the future, like college funds for the kids or emergency savings.

And if not, how much do you usually spend and on what?\n\nElizabeth Carlsen: Last month, our household spent roughly around $6,500, which is actually a bit higher than usual. It was partly because we had a few unexpected expenses\u2014like a new car tire that needed replacing and a last-minute family trip to visit my parents for my father's birthday. Normally, we spend about $5,800 to $6,000 a month, with the majority going toward rent, childcare, and groceries. We also have regular expenses like car insurance, utilities, and a few subscription services for streaming and online learning tools for the kids. I've been trying to track our spending more carefully, especially with the rising cost of living here. It's a balancing act, but we've learned to prioritize what's essential and cut back on things that aren't. For example, we've reduced our dining out and opted for more home-cooked meals, which has helped a bit. I also try to remind myself that while it's not always easy, we're fortunate to have stable incomes and a strong support system. It's not about luxury\u2014it's about making sure we can provide for our family and still give back to the community we're a part of.\n\n",

Renting has always made more sense for us, especially with the way our lives have evolved\u2014both Daniel and I work full time, and with the kids in school, we need flexibility. We're in a part of Cambridge that's still affordable compared to some of the other neighborhoods, but it's clear that housing is a challenge for a lot of people here. I know several families in our community who are struggling to find stable housing, and it's something I think about often in my work.

For example, during the winter months, our heating bill went up quite a bit, and we also had to pay for more winter clothes for the kids. Then, when school started again in the fall, we had to budget for after-school programs and extracurricular activities, which added to our monthly expenses. On the other hand, during the summer, we spent less on childcare since the kids were out of school, but we had higher costs for things like summer camps and family trips. Holidays also bring their own set of expenses\u2014like gift-giving, holiday meals, and sometimes even travel. One thing that's stayed pretty consistent is our rent and utilities, but I've noticed that the cost of groceries has gone up slightly over the year, which is something I've been trying to manage by planning meals more carefully and buying in bulk when possible.

These reflections have also made me more aware of how my financial situation and daily responsibilities contribute to my stress, and how important it is to find ways to adapt and cope without losing sight of what truly matters. I'm grateful for the support I've received from my family and friends, and I hope that by modeling resilience and emotional honesty, I'm helping my kids build a healthier relationship with their own challenges and emotions.",

Both Daniel and I work full time, and while our salaries aren't enormous, they're enough to cover our expenses, especially with the support of our savings and the fact that we both have benefits through our jobs. I think it's important to note that our income isn't just about numbers\u2014it's about the stability it provides for our family. It allows us to live in a safe neighborhood, give our kids access to good schools, and still contribute to the community through our work and volunteer efforts. I know that for many families in our area, even this amount would be a stretch, which is why I'm so passionate about the work I do. It's not about luxury\u2014it's about making sure we can keep showing up for each other and for the people we serve.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nElizabeth Carlsen: I've been at 'Community Roots' for about seven years now, and it's been a journey of growth, both personally and professionally. When I first started, I was still figuring out my role and how to balance my passion for advocacy with the practicalities of nonprofit work. Over time, I've come to appreciate the structure and support that the organization provides. One of the biggest benefits is the health insurance\u2014we have access to medical, dental, and vision coverage, which is something I don't take for granted, especially given my history with migraines and anxiety. We also get a generous amount of paid time off, including vacation days, sick leave, and personal days, which is important for maintaining a healthy work-life balance. The organization also offers professional development opportunities, like workshops and conferences, which have helped me grow in my role and stay connected to the broader advocacy community. I think what stands out most is the sense of purpose that comes with the job. Even on tough days, I know that the work I'm doing matters, and that gives me a lot of motivation to keep going.\n\n",

I have a great relationship with my manager, Sarah Mitchell\u2014she's been with the organization for over a decade, and she has a deep understanding of both the mission and the challenges we face. She's supportive, approachable, and always encourages us to think creatively about how we can better serve the communities we work with. I trust her judgment and feel comfortable coming to her with ideas or concerns. As for my coworkers, we have a strong sense of camaraderie. We're all driven by the same values\u2014compassion, equity, and empowerment\u2014and that shared purpose makes it easier to work together, even when the work is tough. We have regular team meetings where we check in on each other, share updates, and sometimes just vent about the stress of the job. It's not always easy, but I think the fact that we're all in this together makes a big difference. I feel lucky to be part of a team that values both the work we do and the people we do it with.\n\n",

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nElizabeth Carlsen: My work schedule is pretty predictable, but there's definitely some flexibility depending on the needs of the organization and the families we serve. Most weeks, I have core hours from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., but I often stay late when we're planning events or meeting with clients who have limited availability. On the other hand, I do have some flexibility in how I structure my day\u2014sometimes I'll start a bit later if I need to drop the kids off at school, or I'll leave a little earlier if I have a family commitment. That said, there are times when the schedule can be less predictable, especially during the summer or around holidays when we're running community programs or workshops. I appreciate the flexibility it offers, but I also know that it can be challenging when it comes to balancing work and family life. It's something I've had to learn to navigate over the years, and I think it's one of the reasons I value the support of my team so much\u2014they understand the demands of the job and the personal responsibilities that come with it.\n\n",

We're able to cover our basic needs and provide for our kids, which is something I'm deeply grateful for. However, I know that the cost of living here in Cambridge is a strain on many families, and I see it every day in the work I do. There are so many people who are just trying to make ends meet, and it's heartbreaking to see how close to the edge so many of them are. I think the biggest thing that keeps me grounded is knowing that we're not in a position of extreme hardship, and that we have the ability to give back to others who are struggling. It's a delicate balance, and I'm constantly reminded that financial security is something I can't take for granted. I also know that my job and the support we receive from our community are what make this possible, and I try to be mindful of that every day.\n\n",

My mother was a nurse, and she worked part-time for a while when I was younger, but she eventually went back to full-time work after I started college.

He had a way of making even the most difficult subjects feel accessible, and he always believed that education was the key to a better life. He would stay after school to help students who were struggling, and I remember seeing him light up when a student finally understood something they had been working on for weeks. My mother was a nurse, and her most important duties were caring for her patients, making sure they were comfortable, and advocating for them when they needed it most. She had a deep sense of compassion, and I think that's what made her so good at her job. She would often come home exhausted but always made time to talk to me about her day, which taught me the value of empathy and service.

My father's job involved not only teaching subjects like English and history but also mentoring students, organizing school events, and being a constant presence in the lives of the kids he taught. He made sure that education wasn't just about textbooks and tests\u2014it was about preparing students for life. My mother, on the other hand, worked in a hospital's emergency department, where she saw a wide range of patients, from the elderly to newborns. Her job required her to be on her feet all day, to think quickly, and to show compassion even in the most difficult situations. I remember her coming home with stories about the people she helped, and I think that's what made her work so meaningful. Neither of them made a lot of money, but they always made sure we had what we needed, and they taught me that work isn't just about earning a paycheck\u2014it's about making a difference in someone else's life.\n\n",
