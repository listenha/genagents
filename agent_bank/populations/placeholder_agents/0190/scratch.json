  "agent_profile_summary": "Carlos Duran, a 40-year-old Dominican-born resident of the Bronx, has spent his life navigating the challenges of poverty, family responsibility, and self-reliance. Growing up in a small apartment on Elmwood Avenue, he faced the loss of his father and the burden of his mother’s long hours working two jobs to keep them afloat. At 18, he made a defining choice to pursue education part-time while working nights at a bodega, a decision that eventually led him to a graduate degree and a stable career in a local warehouse. Today, he continues to care for his aging mother, balancing work, health struggles, and community involvement, such as volunteering at his church. His life is shaped by a quiet determination to provide for his family and a deep connection to his roots, which influence his values, his resilience, and the way he relates to others with a sense of shared struggle and mutual support."
