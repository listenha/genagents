Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nCarlos Duran: I was born in the Dominican Republic, but I came to the United States when I was just a baby. My parents brought me to the Bronx when I was around two years old, and I've been here ever since. Growing up in the Bronx wasn't easy. My father passed away when I was still a teenager, and my mother worked long hours to keep our heads above water. We lived in a small apartment on Elmwood Avenue, and I remember walking to school every day with my backpack on my shoulder, trying to focus on my studies even though life was tough. I always knew I had to work hard to make something of myself. I got my high school diploma, and then I went on to college, eventually earning a graduate degree. I've been working full time for the past ten years, and while I'm not wealthy, I've built a stable life for myself. I still speak Spanish at home with my family, and I'm proud of my roots. I'm a Catholic, and my faith has always been a source of strength for me. I'm not really political, but I do believe in doing what's right and helping others when I can.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nCarlos Duran: Yeah, there was definitely a crossroads. I was around 18, right after my father passed away. That hit us really hard. My mom was working two jobs, and I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I had a friend who was going to community college and talked me into applying. But I also had another friend who was working at a local store and said I should just get a job and start saving money. I was torn because I knew education was the way out, but I also didn't want to leave my mom alone to struggle. In the end, I decided to go to community college part-time while working nights at a bodega. It wasn't easy\u2014sleeping in the day, studying at night, trying to keep up with classes and work. But that experience taught me discipline and responsibility. I eventually transferred to a four-year university, got my degree, and then went on to graduate school. That decision to keep pushing through, even when it felt impossible, shaped who I am today. I wouldn't be where I am without that moment of choice.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nCarlos Duran: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made easily. I remember sitting at the kitchen table with my mom, looking at the two paths in front of me\u2014education or work. I didn't want to leave her, but I also knew that if I didn't take the chance, I'd be stuck in the same cycle she was in. I told myself that if I worked hard enough, I could make a better life for both of us. It wasn't just about me; it was about giving my mom a future where she wouldn't have to work herself to the bone. I remember praying that night, asking God to guide me, and the next morning, I called the community college and signed up. That moment was the start of something bigger than myself.\n\n",

My mom was working so many hours, she didn't have time to think about things like scholarships or financial aid. I remember seeing flyers at the library about free tutoring and counseling for students from low-income families, but I didn't know how to apply for any of it. If someone had reached out to me, even just to talk, it might have made all the difference. I think organizations that support first-generation students or immigrants could have been a big help. I didn't have anyone to guide me through the process, and that made it harder. But I also know that not everyone has that kind of support, so I try to help others when I can, even in small ways.\n\n",

She's still living with me in that same apartment on Elmwood Avenue, and I make sure she's taken care of. We have a routine\u2014she helps me with some of the cooking, and I take her to the doctor's appointments when needed. I've always felt responsible for her, especially after my father passed away. I know I'm not the most romantic guy, but I think about what's important. I've had a few relationships over the years, but nothing serious. I guess I've been too focused on my goals and making sure we're both okay. I don't mind being single; I have my family, my faith, and my work. That's enough for me.\n\n",

I didn't have much support back then, and I think about how things might have been different if someone had reached out to me. Now, with my mom still living with me, I feel a deep sense of responsibility to take care of her, and I'm grateful for the life I've built.

We don't talk as much as I'd like, but I know they care. My older sister, Maria, she's a nurse, and she always sends me care packages with food and medicine when she can.

We used to hang out a lot, play basketball, and talk about our dreams. Some of them still work at the bodega or other local stores, while others have moved on to different things. One of them, Luis, actually went back to school and became a teacher. He's the one who always reminds me to never stop learning. I don't see them as much as I'd like, but when we do get together, it's like no time has passed. I also have a few coworkers who I consider friends\u2014people who understand the long hours and the struggles of making ends meet.

It's a tight-knit community, even if it's not always easy. There are good people here, people who know each other's names and look out for one another. I've seen a lot of my neighbors struggle, just like I did, but there's a resilience here that's hard to explain. The streets can be rough, and there are challenges\u2014poverty, crime, the constant hustle\u2014but there's also a sense of pride. People work hard, they raise their kids, and they keep going. I still walk to the corner store sometimes, just like I did when I was a kid, and I see the same faces. It's home, even if it's not perfect. I wouldn't trade it for anything because it's where I built my life, where I learned to fight for what I wanted, and where I still have my mom.

I've been mugged once, and that was scary, but I've never felt like I was in danger for long. The streets can be rough, but I've learned to be cautious, to watch my surroundings, and to trust my instincts. I know my neighbors, and they know me.

But there are also days when I look around and wonder if I could have done more, if I could have made things easier for her.

I've been trying to read more\u2014mostly books about personal development or stories from other immigrants who made it through tough times.

They'd wake up early, maybe around 6 or 7, have breakfast, and then head off to school. After school, they'd probably come home, do their homework, and maybe play with friends or join a community program. I know a lot of kids in the neighborhood take part in after-school activities at the community center\u2014things like sports, art classes, or tutoring.

I've been trying to be more present with my mom, even when I'm tired or in pain. We've had some good conversations, and I've realized how much I value her presence in my life. I've also been trying to be more consistent with my health, like going to the gym a few times a week and eating better, even if it's just small changes. I know I'm not perfect, but I'm trying to do better for both of us. Life hasn't been easy, but I've learned to find strength in the little things\u2014the way my mom smiles when I come home, the way the neighborhood feels like home even when it's rough. I'm not where I thought I'd be at this point, but I'm still moving forward, one day at a time.\n\n",

I don't talk about it much, not even with my friends or my sisters, because I don't want them to worry. But I know I can't carry it all on my own.

It's hard to see her in pain because I know how much she's sacrificed for me over the years.

Being Catholic is more than just going to Mass on Sundays\u2014it's about the faith that got me through my father's passing, the struggles of growing up in the Bronx, and the moments when I felt like giving up. I believe in God, and I believe that He has a plan for everyone, even when we can't see it. My mom and I go to church every Sunday, and it's our time to pray, to reflect, and to remember where we came from. I've always felt that faith gives you something to hold on to when life feels too heavy. It doesn't erase the pain, but it helps you carry it. I know some people don't believe in religion, and that's okay. But for me, it's been a lifeline, a way to find peace in the chaos, and a reminder that I'm not alone in this journey.\n\n",

I'll check it maybe once a week, see what they're up to, and sometimes I'll post a picture of my mom and me at church or something like that.

Groceries come next, especially since my mom doesn't eat much these days and I try to make sure she gets the right things.

It's not about being perfect\u2014it's about not letting the stress break me. I've also thought a lot about how my family and my faith have been my anchors through all of this. They've given me strength when I didn't have any left, and I'm grateful for that. Even though life hasn't been easy, I know I'm doing the best I can, and that has to count for something.",

It's not a lot, but it's enough to cover the basics\u2014rent, groceries, my mom's medical bills, and the car payment. I work full time, and that's it. I know I could be making more, but I've never been one for taking risks. This job has kept us stable for years, and I don't want to mess with that. I've thought about going back to school for something else, maybe a management course or something that could lead to a better-paying job, but I don't know if I can afford it right now. I want to make sure we're both taken care of, and I don't want to take on more debt. It's a tight balance, but I've learned to live within my means. I'm not rich, but I'm not struggling either. I just hope that one day, I can do a little better\u2014not for myself, but for my mom, who has always given me everything.\n\n",

The benefits aren't much\u2014just a few days of paid time off a year, and no health insurance through the job. I've always had to rely on my own savings or my mom's insurance for medical stuff. The company does offer some sort of retirement plan, but I don't know much about it because I've never really looked into it. What I do know is that the job gives me a steady paycheck, and that's what matters most. I've seen other workers leave for better opportunities, but I've always stayed because I know this job keeps us afloat. It's not perfect, but it's honest work, and I respect that. I don't ask for much\u2014just a way to provide for my mom and keep our heads above water. That's been enough for me.\n\n",

I've been there long enough to know my place, and the other workers respect that. My manager is a no-nonsense guy, always focused on getting the job done. He doesn't play favorites, and he doesn't tolerate slacking off. I've had my share of disagreements with him over the years, especially when I've had to push back because of my mom's health or when I've been in too much pain to work at full capacity. But for the most part, we get along. He knows I'm not one to cause trouble, and I know he's not going to fire me for something minor. As for my coworkers, we all have our own stories, our own struggles. Some of them are immigrants like me, others are locals who've been in the Bronx their whole lives. We talk about everything\u2014work, family, the neighborhood. It's not always easy, but there's a kind of brotherhood there. We look out for each other, even if it's just a nod or a quick word when someone's having a rough day. I don't ask for much from this job, but I do appreciate the people I work with. They're real, they're honest, and they've been there for me when I needed it most.\n\n",

I start at 7 a.m. every day, five days a week, and I usually finish around 3 p.m. The hours are consistent, which helps me plan my day around taking care of my mom and managing my health. But it's not always flexible. If there's a rush or a shipment that needs to be handled, we sometimes have to stay late, and there's not much I can do about it. I've learned to roll with it, but it's not ideal when I have to push through the pain just to meet a deadline. Still, the predictability gives me a sense of control, even if it's not much. I know when I need to be there, and I know when I can come home and be with my mom. That's something I can count on, and in a life that's had so many uncertainties, that's not nothing.\n\n",

I've never been one for complaining, but sometimes I wonder if I'm just stuck in this cycle\u2014working hard, barely making ends meet, and never really getting ahead. I want more than this, but I also know that I can't just quit my job or take a risk without knowing I'll be able to take care of her.

It also made me think about how my job at the warehouse, while steady, doesn't offer much in the way of benefits or flexibility, which limits my ability to plan for the future.

She never complained, not really. She just did what she had to do to make sure we had food on the table and a roof over our heads. I was still in high school then, and I remember feeling guilty for not being able to help more, but I didn't know how. She always told me not to worry, that she was used to working hard. But looking back now, I realize how much she sacrificed for me.

She'd start her day early, sometimes before dawn, cleaning floors, washing dishes, and making sure everything was spotless before the customers came in. Then, after that, she'd go to a different job, usually someplace else in the Bronx, where she'd clean offices or apartments. It wasn't easy work, but she did it with pride. She always said that if you clean someone else's home, you have to treat it like it's your own. I remember seeing her come home with her hands sore, her back aching, but she never complained. She just took off her apron, sat down for a minute, and then started cooking dinner. I used to think she was just tired, but now I realize how much strength it took for her to keep going, day after day, without ever asking for much in return. She gave me everything she could, even when she didn't have much to give. That's why I feel like I owe it to her to take care of her now, just like she did for me when I was growing up.\n\n",

She didn't make much, just enough to cover the rent and groceries, but she always made sure we had what we needed.
