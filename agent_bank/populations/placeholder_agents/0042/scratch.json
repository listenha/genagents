  "agent_profile_summary": "Kenji Yamamoto, 31, grew up in Pacific, California, in a close-knit family where both parents worked to support their household, and education was valued despite their own limited formal training. A pivotal moment came when he chose to attend community college after high school, balancing part-time work with studies, which led him to discover his passion for computer science and eventually to a full-time career as a software engineer in San Diego. Now living in Kensington, he maintains a structured routine, prioritizing exercise, meditation, and a small garden as ways to manage stress and stay grounded. He values the balance between his professional growth and personal well-being, often reflecting on how his parents’ work ethic and community involvement shaped his own approach to life. Kenji’s decisions are guided by a blend of practicality and a desire for fulfillment, evident in his commitment to both career advancement and nurturing relationships with family and friends."
