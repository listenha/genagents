Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nRosa Gagnon: Sure, let's take it back to the beginning. I was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and grew up in a small town nearby. My parents were both from Italy but had moved to the United States when they were young. They met and got married while working at a local factory. I have fond memories of celebrating Italian holidays with my extended family, even though my parents were not particularly religious.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nRosa Gagnon: Certainly, there was a pivotal moment in my life that truly shaped who I am today. When I turned sixteen, my parents decided to separate. It was a difficult time, especially since it happened right before my senior year of high school. My mom moved into a small apartment in the city, while my dad continued to live in our family home. My father found a job in a different part of town, which meant he didn't see me as much anymore. My mom took on a part-time job to help support us, and we started attending a different church because my dad didn't want anything to do with religion anymore. That separation was a turning point for me. It forced me to grow up quickly and take on more responsibilities. I had to learn how to manage my time better and become more independent. Even though it was tough, it also taught me resilience and the importance of adaptability.\n\n",

I knew that getting good grades and graduating high school were important goals for me, even though things were changing around me. I remember feeling a bit lost at times, but I also felt a sense of determination to prove to myself that I could handle whatever life threw at me.\n\n",

She suggested I join a local community group for teenagers going through similar situations, which turned out to be incredibly helpful. I also had a few close friends who were always there for me, offering support and encouragement. But ultimately, I think I relied on myself to get through those tough times.\n\n",

The houses here are mostly single-family homes, and the streets are usually quiet except for the occasional friendly wave from neighbors.

During the week, I usually wake up early, around 6:30 AM, to catch the morning light. I spend some time exercising, maybe a quick run or yoga session, to keep myself in shape. Then I head to the kitchen to prepare breakfast, often something simple like oatmeal or toast. After breakfast, I check in with my husband, John, and we discuss our plans for the day. We both work from home most of the time, so we try to stay connected and make sure we're on the same page. I might spend some time organizing the house or doing some light household chores. In the afternoon, I might have a video call with my mother or my friend Sarah, catching up on our week. We also have a book club that meets virtually every other week, which is a nice way to unwind and discuss literature. In the evenings, we might go for a walk around the neighborhood or have dinner with friends. Weekends are a bit more relaxed. We might have guests over for lunch, or we'll plan a trip to a local restaurant or museum. Sometimes, we take advantage of the tourist season to explore the city, although it can be a bit chaotic at times.

I've leaned on my support system, including John, my friends, and family, to help navigate these challenges. Social media has also played a role in staying connected with the wider world and sharing aspects of our life, which has been comforting during tough times.",

Our biggest expenses last month were probably the mortgage for the new house, utilities, and groceries. The mortgage is a bit higher than what we were used to, but we're both contributing to it, so it's manageable. Utilities are always a constant, but we try to keep them under control by conserving energy. Groceries can be a bit of a challenge, especially when we're trying to maintain a healthy diet, but we make a shopping list and try to buy in bulk to save money.\n\n",

That's actually a bit lower than usual because we cut back on dining out and tried to use coupons for groceries. Our usual spending is closer to $3,500, but we've been more mindful of our budget lately due to the economic uncertainty.

    "content": "Completing this interview and recounting my life story has been both a journey of reflection and a reaffirmation of the key moments and relationships that have shaped me. From my childhood in South Carolina to the challenges of my teenage years, the support of my family and friends, and now the prospect of starting a family and moving to our new house, each chapter of my life has been marked by growth and resilience. The interview has highlighted the importance of maintaining a strong support system, whether it's through my immediate family, close friends, or the broader community. It has also underscored the significance of balancing daily responsibilities with personal growth and pursuing hobbies that bring joy and connect me to my heritage. Reflecting on the past year, the uncertainties brought by the pandemic have tested my mental fortitude, but engaging in my passions and leaning on my support network have been crucial in navigating these challenges. The interview serves as a reminder of how far I've come and the steps I need to take to continue on this journey of personal and familial fulfillment.",
