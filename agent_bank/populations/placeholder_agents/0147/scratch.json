  "agent_profile_summary": "Anne Mullins, a 43-year-old resident of Des Moines, Iowa, grew up in a small, tight-knit neighborhood where she witnessed her mother work multiple jobs to support the family after Anne’s father passed away when she was ten. This early experience solidified her belief in the power of education and hard work, leading her to pursue a bachelor’s degree in business administration and build a stable career as an accountant. Married for over a decade to Tom, with whom she shares two children, Anne balances her full-time job with family life in the same house she grew up in, a place she views as a symbol of resilience and continuity. She remains deeply committed to her community, often relying on neighbors and friends for support, and continues to prioritize health and mindfulness, even after a recent herniated disc diagnosis. Her life reflects a quiet determination to create stability and meaning, rooted in the lessons of her past and the connections she values most."
