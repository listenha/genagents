  "agent_profile_summary": "Lorenzo Johnson, a 37-year-old social work graduate student from Newark, New Jersey, grew up in a single-parent household and has spent much of his life navigating the challenges of poverty, education, and community resilience. A pivotal moment came during his junior year of high school when he chose a summer internship at a local nonprofit over a convenience store job, a decision that set him on a path toward helping at-risk youth. Now, he balances part-time work at a community center with his studies, dedicating himself to mentoring and supporting kids from his neighborhood. His commitment to education and community service is deeply rooted in his mother’s sacrifices and the lessons of resilience he learned growing up. While he grapples with financial strain and health challenges, Lorenzo remains focused on building a stable future—not just for himself, but to create opportunities for others, reflecting a quiet determination to break cycles and uplift those around him."
