    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nLance Moran: Well, I was born in Texas, in a small town in the West South Central region, and I've always had a deep connection to the state, even though I moved to Austin when I was in my early twenties. Growing up, I was raised by my parents in a pretty stable environment. My father had a bachelor's degree and worked in engineering, while my mother had an associate's degree and worked part-time as a nurse. We were never really poor, but we weren't rolling in money either. I remember going to church every Sunday as a kid\u2014my family was Catholic, and I even considered becoming a priest for a while, but that didn't last. I think I was more interested in the world outside my town than the one inside the church. I went to college in Texas, got my bachelor's in political science, and that's really where my political views started to take shape. I was always more liberal than my parents, especially when it came to social issues, and that's why I ended up identifying as a strong Democrat. I married my wife, Sarah, in our early thirties, and we've been together ever since. We have two kids, and I work full-time as a policy analyst. Life hasn't been without its challenges, but I've always believed in working hard and making the most of what you have.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nLance Moran: Yeah, there was definitely a crossroads. I was about 21, right after I graduated from college with my bachelor's in political science. I had two options: take a job in my hometown with a local government office or move to Austin and work for a nonprofit that focused on education reform. My parents wanted me to stay close, and I was tempted because I didn't want to leave the only home I'd ever known. But I had this growing sense that I wanted to be part of something bigger, something that could really make a difference. I remember sitting on my porch one night, staring at the stars, and thinking about the kids in our town who didn't have the same opportunities I did. I decided to take the leap to Austin. It wasn't easy\u2014my first few months were tough, I had to live in a tiny apartment and work long hours\u2014but it was the right choice. That decision shaped who I am today, both professionally and personally. It's what led me to meet Sarah, and it's what made me the person I am now\u2014someone who believes in fighting for what's right, even when it's hard.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nLance Moran: I think it was a conscious choice, but not in the way you might expect. I wasn't making a grand decision with a clear plan\u2014I was just reacting to what felt right in the moment. I remember feeling this quiet pressure, like the universe was nudging me toward something. I wasn't sure what that something was, but I knew staying in my hometown would mean settling into a life that felt safe but also stagnant. I wanted to be part of a movement, to work on issues that mattered, even if it meant uncertainty. I think, in a way, I was choosing to trust myself more than I ever had before. It wasn't just about the job or the city\u2014it was about believing that I had the power to shape my own path, even if it wasn't the easiest one.\n\n",

My mother, for instance, was the one who really pushed me to consider the nonprofit job. She saw something in me that I didn't see in myself at the time. She said, 'If you're going to chase something, chase something that makes you feel alive.' That stuck with me. And then there was a professor from my political science class, Dr. Ellis, who had worked in education reform. He took me under his wing for a few months, gave me some contacts, and even helped me with my resume. Without people like them, I don't know if I would have had the courage to take that leap. It's funny, though\u2014I think the biggest help came from my own fear of staying in the same place. That fear became the push I needed to move forward.\n\n",

Sarah is a school counselor, and she's the one who really keeps our family grounded. She's the heart of our home, always making sure our kids feel loved and supported. We met in Austin, actually, through a mutual friend who worked at the same nonprofit I did. She was volunteering at a community center, and I was running some policy workshops there. We hit it off right away, but it took a while for us to realize we were meant to be together. Life with kids has been both challenging and rewarding. There are days when I feel like I'm juggling a dozen things at once, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. Our kids are curious, creative, and full of life\u2014just like their parents. I think the biggest lesson I've learned from being a father is that you don't have to have all the answers; you just have to be there, day in and day out, doing your best.\n\n",

My father, Frank, is retired now after working as an engineer for over thirty years. He's always been the kind of guy who believed in hard work and doing things the right way. My mother, Margaret, is more of a quiet force\u2014she's the one who kept our family together, even during the tough times.

We talk often, and whenever I go back for holidays or visits, it's like no time has passed. My parents never pushed me to follow a certain path, but they always supported my decisions, even when they didn't fully understand them.

One of them is Dr. Ellis, the professor I mentioned earlier\u2014he's more than just a mentor; he's like a second father to me. He's been a constant source of wisdom and guidance, especially when I was starting out in Austin. Then there's my friend Marcus, who I met in college. We've been through a lot together, from late-night study sessions to the early days of our careers. He's the one who always reminds me to stay grounded and not take myself too seriously. And of course, there's Sarah's best friend, Lisa, who's been like a sister to me since the day we met. She's the one who helped me understand what it really means to be part of a family beyond blood relations.

It's not the most traditional part of the city, but that's what I love about it. There are a lot of artists, musicians, and young professionals who have made this place their home. The streets are lined with old trees, and there's a real sense of community here. We have a lot of local shops, coffee places, and even a few small theaters. It's not the kind of place where everyone knows your name, but you do feel like you're part of something bigger. I like that it's not too far from downtown, so I can still get to work easily, but it's also quiet enough that I can come home and feel like I'm in a safe, welcoming space.

That said, I think safety is more about how you engage with your neighborhood than just where you live. I've made an effort to get to know my neighbors, join local events, and be part of the community. It's not perfect, but I feel like I'm in a place where I can walk my kids to school, let them play outside, and not worry too much.

On the one hand, it's a place that feels alive and full of potential, but it's also not without its struggles. The cost of living here is higher than I expected, and sometimes it feels like we're always stretching a bit to make ends meet. But I think that's part of what makes it real\u2014there's no pretending everything is perfect. The community here is what really makes it worth it. I've been involved in a few local initiatives, like a neighborhood clean-up project and a community garden, and those experiences have brought me closer to people I might not have otherwise met. There's a certain kind of energy here that's hard to describe, but I think it's the kind of energy that pushes you to grow, to be better, and to care more about the people around you. I wouldn't say I'm completely without stress, but I feel like I'm living in a place that challenges me in the right ways\u2014where I can be both a part of something bigger and still be myself.\n\n",

I usually start my week on Monday with a morning routine\u2014coffee, a quick walk with the kids, and then heading into the office. My job as a policy analyst keeps me busy, so most days involve meetings, research, and collaborating with colleagues on various projects. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are often the busiest, with a lot of deadlines and reports to finish. I try to leave work by 6 p.m. most days so I can be there for dinner with the kids. On Thursdays, I usually take my kids to the park or the library, and I make sure to set aside some time for myself, whether it's reading or catching up with friends.

It's not just about staying in shape\u2014it's a way for me to clear my mind and process the day's challenges. I also have a habit of journaling, something I picked up in college as a way to track my thoughts and reflect on my progress.

On the weekends, I like to spend some time working on small home projects, whether it's fixing something around the house or building something for the kids.

Emily goes to a public school in the district, while Jake is in a private school that's a bit of a drive, but it's worth it for the smaller class sizes and the extra support they offer. After school, Emily usually has a soccer practice or a club meeting, while Jake has piano lessons and sometimes a coding class. I try to be there for both of them whenever I can, but it's not always possible with work. On days when I can't make it, Sarah or one of the kids' friends usually helps out. What I love most is seeing them so engaged in their activities\u2014Emily's always talking about her soccer team and how they're trying to qualify for the regional tournament, and Jake is really into his coding projects, even though he still thinks of himself as a beginner.

I try to eat a balanced diet\u2014lots of vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains\u2014but I'm definitely not perfect about it.

It's also helped that Sarah and I have started cooking more meals at home, which means we're eating better and not relying as much on takeout. What makes it hard, though, is the constant juggling act between work, family, and personal time. There are days when I'm so caught up in meetings or helping the kids with homework that I forget to eat properly or get enough rest. I think the biggest challenge is maintaining consistency, especially when life feels like it's moving at a hundred miles an hour.

It started as a minor annoyance, something I could ignore most of the time, but it's gotten worse over the past year. I finally saw a physical therapist a few months ago, and it turns out I have some mild disc degeneration. It's not serious, but it's something I need to manage moving forward. The therapist has given me a series of exercises to strengthen my core and improve my posture, and I've been doing them regularly. It's been a bit of a wake-up call, honestly.

How about for you?\n\nLance Moran: I think I've been pretty fortunate in that I haven't struggled with depression or anxiety in the way that some people do. That said, there have been moments\u2014especially during the early days of moving to Austin, or when work got overwhelming\u2014that I felt a bit lost or unsure of myself. I remember one particular time, a few years back, when I was juggling a big project at work, helping Sarah with some home renovations, and trying to keep up with the kids' schedules. It felt like I was constantly running on empty, and I wasn't sure how much longer I could keep it up. I didn't really talk about it with anyone, not even Sarah, because I didn't want to burden her. But looking back, I realize that those moments were a sign that I needed to slow down and take a step back. I've since learned the importance of talking through my feelings, even when it's hard. I think the biggest thing is that I've come to accept that it's okay to not be okay sometimes. It's not a weakness\u2014it's just part of being human.

I can see how much she cares about her students, and it's inspiring, but I also worry about her stress levels.

We've had our share of tough days, especially when work and life feel overwhelming, but I think we've grown closer as a family.

Growing up, I was raised Catholic, and I remember going to church every Sunday with my family. It was a part of our routine, and I even considered becoming a priest for a while. But as I got older, I started to question a lot of the teachings and the role of organized religion in my life. I never really felt a deep connection to the church, and I think that's why I drifted away from it. These days, I don't identify with any particular religion, but I do believe in something bigger than myself. I find spirituality in the everyday moments\u2014like watching my kids grow, being part of this community, or even just taking a walk in the park and feeling the quiet peace of the world around me. I think of it more as a personal journey, something that's not about following rules or doctrines, but about finding meaning and connection in the world. I don't know if I'd call it spirituality or just a sense of gratitude, but I feel like it's what keeps me grounded and reminds me of what's truly important in life.\n\n",

I've tried using Facebook in the past, mostly to stay in touch with family back home and some old friends from college, but it never really clicked for me. I find myself scrolling through posts and getting caught up in other people's lives, which doesn't always feel good.

I do use it occasionally to follow some local artists and community events in East Side, which has been a nice way to stay connected to what's happening around me.

I know a lot of people use it as a way to vent or ask for help, but I've always found that kind of thing harder to do online. There's something about putting your struggles out there for strangers to see that feels too exposed, even if it's well-intentioned. For me, support has always come from the people I know in real life\u2014my family, my friends, my coworkers. When things get tough, I lean on them, not on a screen. That said, I do appreciate the way social media can connect people to resources or communities they might not have access to otherwise.

There were times when I felt like I was constantly juggling a hundred things at once, and it was hard to keep up. But I've been working on developing better coping strategies. One of the biggest changes has been incorporating mindfulness into my daily routine, like those short meditation sessions I mentioned earlier. It's helped me stay more centered, even on the busiest days. I've also started talking more openly with Sarah about how I'm feeling, which has made a huge difference. It's easy to bottle things up, but I've realized that sharing my worries, even the small ones, helps me process them better.

Groceries are another big one\u2014between Emily and Jake, they're always trying new foods or asking for snacks, and Sarah and I try to make sure they eat well.

I've been trying to track our budget more closely, and it's been eye-opening. It's not that we're struggling, but it's a constant reminder of how much goes into raising kids and keeping a household running.

Normally, we hover around $3,800 to $4,000 a month. The increase was mostly due to unexpected car repairs and a few extra expenses for the kids' school activities. Rent is our biggest fixed cost, taking up about $1,800, and groceries usually come in around $800 to $900. The kids' activities, like soccer, piano, and coding classes, add another $400 to $500 each month. We also have health insurance, utilities, and some savings set aside for emergencies. It's not always easy to keep track of everything, but I've started using a budgeting app to help us stay on top of things.

In the winter, our utility bills\u2014especially heating\u2014went up, and we had to budget a bit more for that. Then, when school started back up, we had to factor in those extra fees for Emily's soccer season and Jake's coding classes. There was also the holiday season, which brought in a few unexpected costs\u2014gifts for the kids, a family trip to visit my parents, and some holiday meals that ended up being more expensive than we anticipated. On the flip side, during the summer, we didn't have to worry about heating, and some of the kids' activities slowed down, which gave us a bit of a financial breather.

A big part of my job is attending meetings, whether it's with school boards, advocacy groups, or government agencies, to discuss how we can improve access to quality education.

It also keeps me grounded in the work I do\u2014reminding me that policy analysis isn't just about reports and meetings, but about real people and real needs. I think it's important to have a variety of experiences, even if they're not all formal jobs. It helps you see the bigger picture and understand how different parts of your life are interconnected.\n\n",

Talking about my stress levels and coping strategies reminded me of how important it is to take time for myself, whether it's through mindfulness, conversation with Sarah, or simply being in nature. Thinking about my monthly budget and the fluctuating expenses brought home how much goes into keeping our household running, and how much I've learned to be intentional with our spending. It also made me appreciate how much my family and I have grown in learning to manage life's challenges together. I've come to understand that financial stability, emotional health, and family support are all deeply connected, and that finding balance in all of them is what keeps me grounded and moving forward.",

That comes from my full-time job as a policy analyst and the freelance consulting work I do on the side. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our expenses and save a little for the future. I've been trying to be more transparent about our finances with Sarah and the kids, especially as they get older and start to understand the value of money. It's not always easy talking about money, but I think it's important for them to see how we manage it and what choices we make. I've also been working on improving my financial literacy, reading up on budgeting strategies and investing basics. It's something I wish I had learned earlier, but I'm grateful I'm starting now. I think the biggest lesson I've learned is that money isn't just about earning\u2014it's about managing, planning, and being mindful of what you spend and why.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nLance Moran: I've been at my current job for almost a decade now, and it's been a journey. The benefits package is pretty standard for a nonprofit\u2014health insurance, dental, vision, and a decent amount of paid time off. We get about three weeks of vacation each year, plus sick days and holidays. I think what makes the benefits meaningful is how they align with the mission of the organization. For example, the health insurance covers mental health services, which I've found really valuable, especially during the more stressful times in my life. The flexibility of the job also allows me to take time off when I need it, whether it's for family or personal reasons. I've taken a few weeks off to be with Sarah during her more demanding work periods, and the team has always been supportive. I think the biggest benefit isn't just the tangible things like insurance or vacation days\u2014it's the sense of purpose that comes with knowing my work is making a real difference in people's lives.

I've been lucky to have a manager, Clara, who's both competent and compassionate. She's the kind of leader who trusts her team and gives them the space to do their best work. I've had my disagreements with her, of course, but she's always been open to feedback and willing to listen. As for my coworkers, I'd say we're all in this together. We're not just colleagues; we're a team of people who genuinely care about the work we do. I've built strong relationships with a few of them over the years\u2014people like Marcus, who I mentioned earlier, and a few others who've become like family. We support each other through the ups and downs, and that sense of camaraderie makes the job more than just a paycheck.

Most days, I start around 8 a.m. and finish by 5 p.m., though I often stay a little later on busy days or leave a bit early if I need to pick up the kids from school. The flexibility is one of the things that makes this job work for me\u2014it allows me to adjust my hours when needed, whether it's for a family event or to take care of something personal. That said, there are times when the schedule can be less predictable, especially when we're preparing for big meetings or working on tight deadlines. I've learned to be proactive about planning my time, and I've also gotten pretty good at communicating with my manager when I need to adjust my hours.

I think the biggest thing is that we've learned to be intentional with our money, which has helped us avoid unnecessary debt and stay on top of our expenses.

He was the kind of person who could look at a blueprint and visualize the whole structure in his mind before it was even built.

It was a family-owned business, and I remember visiting the office sometimes when I was a kid. They had blueprints spread out all over the place, and my dad would explain what each part meant. He was the lead engineer on most of their projects, which meant he was out on site a lot, supervising workers and making sure everything was up to code. My mom worked at a local clinic that served a lot of low-income families, and she was part of a small team of nurses and doctors.
