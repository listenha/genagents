  "agent_profile_summary": "Nicholas Aguirre, 21, grew up in a middle-class family in Pacific, Oregon, and has lived in Eugene since he was 16. After high school, he chose to take a year off from formal education, opting instead to work part-time at a local bookstore and save for his own apartment, a decision that emphasized his desire for independence over following the traditional college path. Now living in a quiet neighborhood on Eugene’s east side, he continues to work at the same bookstore, where he finds community and purpose in connecting with customers and organizing literary events. He values simplicity and stability, reflected in his routine of part-time work, evening classes at the community college, and small creative pursuits like photography. His life is shaped by a balance between contentment with the present and a quiet curiosity about future possibilities, all grounded in a strong sense of self-reliance and a deep appreciation for the support of his family."
