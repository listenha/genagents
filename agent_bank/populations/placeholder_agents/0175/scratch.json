  "agent_profile_summary": "Katherine Wright, a 24-year-old from Lansing, Michigan, grew up in a small town where her mother’s determination and hard work shaped her early life. After her parents’ divorce, she chose to pursue a college education over an immediate job, a decision that defined her path and led her to a career as a customer service manager. Now living independently in a quiet neighborhood, she balances her full-time job with volunteering at a local food pantry, a commitment that reflects her values of community and self-reliance. Her life is structured around routine, stability, and personal growth, with a focus on her career and maintaining close ties with her mother. While she remains open to the possibility of a future partner, she prioritizes her independence and the quiet confidence that comes from knowing she has built her life through effort and resilience."
