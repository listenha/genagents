  "agent_profile_summary": "Anthony Santana, a 25-year-old policy analyst in Providence, Rhode Island, grew up in Narragansett, where his parents’ working-class resilience and emphasis on education shaped his values. After graduating from Brown University, he chose to stay in Rhode Island and work for a local non-profit focused on economic equity, a decision influenced by his mother’s advice to “be the change right here.” Rooted in his community, he balances a demanding career with personal rituals like playing guitar and cooking Spanish dishes inspired by his grandmother. His work centers on grassroots impact, advocating for policies that improve education and housing for underserved populations. While he prioritizes his career and family, he remains open to future possibilities, navigating the tension between personal growth and commitment to his community. His thoughtful, grounded approach reflects a deep connection to the people and places that have shaped him."
