  "agent_profile_summary": "Stephanie Meyer, 41, grew up in Germany before moving to Scranton, Pennsylvania, with her family at age six, where she has lived ever since. A pivotal moment in her life came when she chose to attend community college over a prestigious private high school, a decision rooted in practicality and a desire to support her family. Now a single mother to her teenage daughter, Lily, Stephanie balances part-time work at a local bookstore with caregiving, often volunteering at the library and participating in community activities. Her life is shaped by a steady commitment to her daughter’s dreams and a deep connection to her neighborhood, where she values the close-knit community and the sense of stability it provides. Navigating the challenges of single parenthood and financial strain, she remains focused on building a secure future for Lily while finding solace in shared routines, like gardening and creative projects, that strengthen their bond."
