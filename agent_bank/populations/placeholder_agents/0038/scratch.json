  "agent_profile_summary": "Caitlin O'Brien, a 31-year-old marketing strategist in Charleston, South Carolina, grew up in a middle-class family that valued education and professional achievement, with both parents working in tech and marketing. A defining moment in her life came during her junior year of college when an internship in marketing led her to shift from a tech-focused path to a career in creative problem-solving and strategic thinking, a decision that has since shaped her professional identity. Currently, she balances a demanding full-time job with personal growth, community involvement, and a commitment to mindfulness practices like yoga and meditation. Her life reflects a sustained effort to maintain equilibrium between career ambitions and personal well-being, while nurturing close relationships with family and friends. Caitlin’s thoughtful approach to life is evident in her deliberate choices, from her career pivot to her ongoing efforts to stay grounded in both her work and her values."
