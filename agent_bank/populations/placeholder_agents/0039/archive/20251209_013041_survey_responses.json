While he mentioned being social and engaging with friends and family, his descriptions suggest a preference for balance rather than being extremely reserved. Additionally, he noted that he tries to manage stress and maintain a balanced lifestyle, which indicates a level of social engagement and interaction. However, his tendency to reflect on his experiences and seek support from his family and online communities suggests a more reserved nature compared to someone who is very outgoing.",

He has mentioned seeking support from family and online communities during tough times, which indicates a willingness to trust and rely on others.

            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Kevin has experienced significant stress and anxiety, especially during the pandemic and with his research project. However, he has actively worked on coping mechanisms like therapy, mindfulness, and journaling, indicating that he is making efforts to manage his stress. Given his acknowledgment of these challenges and his efforts to address them, it suggests he is improving his stress management skills.

            "BFI-10_9": "Based on Kevin's description, he has faced significant stress and anxiety, especially during the pandemic and due to his demanding academic schedule. He has been actively seeking support and implementing coping mechanisms, indicating that he does experience nervousness and anxiety. However, he is also described as someone who manages his stress through various techniques and has a support network, suggesting he is not constantly overwhelmed by nervousness. Given these factors, a middle ground of 3 seems most fitting.",
