Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nKevin Anderson: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born and raised in a small town in East North Central, which is now my home state. My parents were both teachers, and they instilled in me the importance of education. They moved us around quite a bit when I was younger, but we always managed to settle in the same state, though often in different cities. My father pursued a master's degree, while my mother earned her bachelor's in English literature. They worked hard to provide us with a good life, even if it wasn't always easy financially.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nKevin Anderson: There was one particular moment during high school that felt like a crossroads for me. I was deciding whether to go to college right after graduation or take a gap year to travel and work. My parents wanted me to go straight to college, but I felt like I needed to explore the world a bit first. In the end, I chose to take the gap year. It was a challenging decision, as it meant delaying my education, but I'm glad I did it. That experience taught me a lot about myself and the world, and I think it helped me mature faster. When I finally enrolled in college, I knew what I wanted to study and how I wanted to approach my education.\n\n",

I ended up working in Europe for a few months, teaching English and backpacking around. It was a transformative experience, and it really shaped my worldview and career goals. I returned home more confident and ready to tackle higher education.\n\n",

She suggested I look into international relations, which I found intriguing, given my experiences abroad.

I try to keep my spending on social media and entertainment to a minimum. I've been using apps to track my expenses and set a monthly budget, which has helped me stay on top of things.

The rent for my apartment is about $900, which is a bit steep, but it's worth it for the location and amenities.

In the beginning of the year, right around the start of the semester, my bills went up quite a bit. Rent remained the same, but I had to purchase textbooks and pay for lab fees, which added about $200 to my monthly expenses. Groceries also increased a bit because I was cooking more at home to save money on dining out. By mid-year, things settled down a bit, and I managed to keep my spending more or less in check. However, towards the end of the year, especially during finals week, my stress levels spiked, and I found myself ordering takeout more often, which drove up my food expenses. Utility bills also tended to be higher during colder months, as I kept my apartment warm. Overall, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster, but I've been trying to be more mindful of my spending and plan ahead.\n\n",
