  "agent_profile_summary": "Alicia Martinez, a 34-year-old social worker in Columbia, South Carolina, grew up in a close-knit family that valued education and hard work, shaped by her parents' backgrounds as a teacher and engineer. After college, she chose to pursue a graduate degree in social work rather than enter the workforce immediately, a decision influenced by a pivotal sociology class and mentorship that redirected her toward advocacy for marginalized communities. Now married to a software developer, she balances her demanding job at a nonprofit with volunteer work in youth empowerment and community-building efforts. Her life is marked by a steady commitment to social justice and a growing awareness of the challenges of affordability and family planning. Alicia approaches life with a blend of resilience and intentionality, often reflecting on how her values—rooted in family, purpose, and community—shape her choices and interactions."
