  "agent_profile_summary": "Kira Mason, a 21-year-old Muslim woman of Somali and Ethiopian descent, grew up in Chicago’s modest neighborhoods, navigating the challenges of a divorced family and financial instability. Her decision to stay in school during high school, despite the pressure to work, marked a turning point, leading her to community college and eventually a degree in business administration. Now working full-time in human resources at a tech company in Lincoln Park, she balances a demanding job with volunteer work at a nonprofit supporting underprivileged youth, a commitment rooted in her own experiences. Her life is shaped by a tension between financial security and community engagement, as she strives to build an emergency fund while giving back. Grounded in her faith and close to her mother, Kira approaches life with a pragmatic optimism, often reflecting on how small, consistent choices have brought her to this point."
