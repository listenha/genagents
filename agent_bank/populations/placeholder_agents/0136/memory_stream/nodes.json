    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMadeline Jensen: I was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and grew up in a small, tight-knit neighborhood where everyone knew each other. My parents were both well-educated\u2014my father had a graduate degree in engineering, and my mother had a bachelor's in education. They worked hard, and we had a comfortable life, though things changed when my parents divorced when I was around twelve. I remember feeling like the world shifted overnight. My mother moved to a different part of the state for a teaching job, and I had to adjust to a new school, new friends, and a new routine. It wasn't easy, but I learned to be independent early on. I excelled in school, especially in the sciences, and I was always curious about how things worked. I ended up earning a bachelor's degree in environmental science, which I thought would lead me to a stable career. But after graduation, the job market wasn't as promising as I had hoped, and I found myself laid off after a short stint at a local nonprofit. I've been looking for work ever since, and while it's been challenging, I've used this time to explore other interests\u2014like learning Spanish, which I've always wanted to do, and volunteering in my community. Life hasn't gone exactly as I planned, but I'm still hopeful and trying to stay positive.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMadeline Jensen: One of those crossroads came right after I graduated from college. I had two main options: take a job with a small environmental consulting firm in Charleston or move to a bigger city for a graduate program in sustainable development. I was torn because the job would have given me immediate experience and stability, but the graduate program felt like the more long-term investment in my career. I chose the graduate program, thinking it would open more doors and give me the tools to make a real impact in the field. But halfway through my first semester, I realized I was struggling to keep up with the pace and the pressure of the program, and I missed the hands-on work I had done in my undergraduate studies. I ended up dropping out and returning to Charleston, which was a hard decision. It felt like a failure at the time, but looking back, it was the right choice for me. It forced me to reevaluate what I wanted from my career and gave me the time to explore other interests, like volunteering and learning Spanish. That experience taught me that sometimes the path that seems less conventional can lead to the most meaningful growth.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nMadeline Jensen: I think it was a mix of both, honestly. There was a conscious decision to drop out, but there were also a lot of external factors that made it feel like the right time. I was overwhelmed, and I wasn't enjoying the program the way I thought I would. It wasn't just about making a choice\u2014it was about realizing that I needed to take a step back and reassess what I truly wanted. I remember sitting in my dorm room one night, staring at my textbooks, and just feeling this deep sense of disconnection. I didn't want to be in a place where I felt like I was just going through the motions. So, I made the decision to leave, but it also felt like something inside me was pushing me to do it. I think that's what makes life so complex\u2014sometimes the choices we make are a combination of what we want and what we need, even if we don't fully understand it at the time.\n\n",

I was pretty stubborn about handling everything on my own, which probably made things harder than they needed to be. If I had reached out to a counselor or even a mentor, maybe I could have worked through some of the doubts I was feeling instead of just shutting down. I remember thinking that I had to prove to myself that I could handle the pressure, but in reality, I was just trying to do it all alone. Looking back, I wish I had been more open to support\u2014whether it was from friends, family, or professionals. It's something I've tried to be more aware of since then, both for myself and for others who might be going through similar struggles.\n\n",

After my parents' divorce, I became pretty focused on my studies and career, and I think that made it harder to build lasting connections. I've dated a few people since college, but none of them really stuck around. I'm not sure if it's because I was still figuring out who I was or if I just hadn't met the right person yet. My mother and I stay in touch, and we talk pretty regularly. She's been a big support system for me, especially during the time I was laid off. I also have a few close friends from college who I keep in contact with, and we meet up whenever we can. Family and friends are really important to me, even if I don't always show it. I think I've learned that it's okay to ask for help and to lean on the people who care about you\u2014especially after going through some tough times on my own.\n\n",

I've learned that sometimes the paths we take aren't the ones we expect, but they can lead to unexpected growth. I also realize now how important it is to lean on others during tough times, rather than trying to handle everything alone. Even though I don't have a partner or children right now, my family and friends remain a big part of my life, and I'm grateful for their support.

She's a nurse, which I think is amazing\u2014she's always been the more driven one of us. We don't see each other as much as I'd like, but when we do, it's like no time has passed.

Are there people outside of your family who are important to you?\n\nMadeline Jensen: Outside of my family, there are a few friends who have been really important to me over the years. One of them is Sarah, who I met in college. We were in the same environmental science program, and we bonded over our shared passion for sustainability. Even though we went different paths after graduation\u2014she ended up working for a nonprofit focused on clean energy, while I took a different route\u2014she's always been someone I can count on. We still keep in touch, and she's been a great source of encouragement, especially when I was struggling after being laid off. Then there's Marcus, a friend from high school who I reconnected with a few years ago. He's a musician, and he's helped me stay grounded by reminding me of the importance of creativity and joy in life. I think it's easy to get caught up in the pressures of work and responsibilities, but people like Sarah and Marcus help me remember that there's more to life than just the daily grind.

It's a mix of old and new\u2014there are historic homes with beautiful architecture, but also some newer apartments and condos that have been built in recent years. The area is pretty walkable, which I appreciate, and there are a lot of local shops, cafes, and parks nearby. I live in a small apartment on the second floor of a building that was originally built in the early 1900s. It's not much, but it's cozy and has a lot of character. I love how close I am to the waterfront, and I often take walks along the Battery or sit by the harbor and watch the boats go by. It's a peaceful place, and even though I've been through some tough times, I find comfort in the rhythm of everyday life here. The people in the neighborhood are friendly, and I've made a few new friends through local events and community groups.

There's a real sense of community, and even though I don't know everyone by name, I feel like people look out for each other.

It makes life feel simpler, and I've found that simplicity helps me stay grounded, especially when I'm feeling uncertain about my job search. On the downside, sometimes the pace can feel a bit slow, and I've caught myself longing for more opportunities or challenges.

I usually start my week with a few days of job searching\u2014applying to positions, networking, and sometimes volunteering at a local community center. I find that volunteering helps me stay connected and gives me a sense of purpose, even when things feel uncertain. Midweek, I try to make time for self-care\u2014maybe a yoga class, a walk by the harbor, or just reading a book. I also meet up with Sarah or Marcus for coffee or a meal, which is important for keeping my spirits up. On the weekends, I like to explore the area a bit more\u2014visiting local markets, attending a small art show, or just relaxing at home with a movie.

But after a particularly stressful week of job applications and feeling stuck in a loop of uncertainty, I decided to give it a try. Now, I set my alarm five minutes earlier and spend those minutes just breathing and grounding myself. It's helped me start the day with a bit more clarity, even if it's just for a few minutes. I've also been trying to be more intentional about my sleep schedule, going to bed and waking up at the same time each day.

If I did, I think a typical weekday during the school year would involve a lot of structure\u2014mornings filled with breakfast, getting ready for school, and maybe a quick walk or some quiet time before heading out. After school, there would be homework, extracurricular activities like sports or music lessons, and then family time in the evening. I think it would be beautiful to have that kind of rhythm, to be part of a child's growth and to watch them explore the world.

I used to be pretty active in college, running a few times a week and participating in outdoor clubs, but after I dropped out of graduate school, I got a bit more sedentary. I've been trying to get back into a routine, especially with the mindfulness and yoga I mentioned earlier. I also started going for daily walks along the waterfront, which has helped me both physically and mentally. I do have some chronic issues with anxiety, which I think is tied to the uncertainty of my job search and the pressure I've put on myself to have everything figured out. I've been seeing a therapist occasionally, which has been helpful in learning how to manage that. I also take care of my mental health by staying connected with friends and family, and by making time for things I enjoy, like cooking, reading, and learning Spanish.

On the easy side, living in a place where I can walk almost everywhere helps a lot. I don't have to rely on a car, which means I'm more likely to get outside, move my body, and stay connected to the rhythm of the day. Also, having a routine\u2014like my morning walks or yoga sessions\u2014gives me something to look forward to, even on days when I don't feel like it. But on the harder side, the uncertainty of my job search can really take a toll on my mental health.

I also struggle with consistency\u2014sometimes I fall into a pattern of staying up too late, skipping meals, or not taking the time to care for myself the way I know I should.

There were a few weeks where I was struggling to get out of bed, and I had to really push myself to keep going. I also started experiencing some mild back pain, probably from sitting too long while applying for jobs or volunteering. I didn't think much of it at first, but it got worse over time, so I finally made an appointment with a physical therapist. They said it was mostly due to poor posture and lack of movement, which makes sense given how much I've been sitting. I've been working on strengthening exercises and trying to be more mindful of how I sit and move throughout the day.

There were times when I felt so overwhelmed that I couldn't even bring myself to apply for jobs, let alone focus on anything else. It's frustrating because I know I have the skills and the drive, but sometimes my mind just gets stuck in a loop of self-doubt. I also had to adjust my volunteering schedule a few times when my back pain was at its worst, which was hard because I really value that connection with the community. But honestly, those experiences have taught me a lot about patience and self-compassion. I've learned that it's okay to take a step back when I need to, and that healing\u2014whether mental or physical\u2014is a process that can't be rushed. I'm still working on it, but I'm trying to be more gentle with myself and recognize that progress, even if it's slow, is still progress.\n\n",

There have been moments of hope, like when I landed a few interviews or got positive feedback on my applications, but there have also been a lot of rejections and days where I felt like I wasn't good enough. I've been trying to be more patient with myself, though, and I've started to notice small wins\u2014like finally mastering a Spanish phrase or feeling more confident in my ability to connect with others. I've also been working on my mental health more consistently, going to therapy regularly and practicing mindfulness in the mornings. It's not always easy, but I'm learning that it's okay to have bad days and that healing isn't linear. I've also found comfort in my community, whether it's through volunteering, meeting up with friends, or just walking along the waterfront and feeling the rhythm of the city. I think I'm in a better place than I was a year ago, even if it doesn't always feel that way.

How about for you?\n\nMadeline Jensen: I think I've struggled with anxiety more than anything else, especially over the past few years. It's not the kind of anxiety that comes from a specific event, but more of a constant undercurrent of worry\u2014about my future, my ability to find work, and whether I'm making the right choices. There were times when I felt like I was failing at everything, like I wasn't good enough or that I had missed my chance to build the life I wanted. I've had moments where I felt so overwhelmed that I couldn't even get out of bed, and I had to force myself to do the simplest things, like making a cup of coffee or going for a walk. I've been seeing a therapist for the past few months, and that's been really helpful in learning how to manage those feelings. I've also started journaling more, which helps me process my thoughts and see patterns in how I react to stress. I don't think I've ever officially been diagnosed with depression, but I know that anxiety has been a constant companion for me. What I've learned is that it's okay to not be okay, and that taking small steps\u2014like talking to someone, going for a walk, or just breathing deeply\u2014can make a big difference.

My mother has been the most consistent source of encouragement\u2014she's always believed in me, even when I didn't believe in myself. She's been there to listen when I needed to vent, and she's never made me feel like I was a burden. My sister, on the other hand, has been more hands-on. She's actually helped me with my job search a few times, sending me leads or even introducing me to people in her network. She's always been the more driven one, so it's kind of funny that she's the one who's been pushing me to get back on my feet. My father, though, has been more distant. I think he still feels like he missed out on a lot of my life after the divorce, and I can't blame him for that. We don't talk as much as I'd like, but when we do, it's always awkward. Still, I know he cares, even if he doesn't always show it. Overall, I'm grateful for the support I've received from my family, even if it hasn't always been easy.

My mother was pretty active in church growing up, and I remember going to Sunday school and attending services with her. But as I got older, I started to question a lot of the beliefs I was taught, and I found myself moving away from organized religion. I don't think of myself as spiritual in the traditional sense, but I do find meaning in the small, everyday moments\u2014like the way the sunlight hits the water in the morning, or the quiet comfort of a good book. I think I've come to see spirituality as something more personal and less about following a specific set of rules or doctrines.

I know it's a big part of how people stay connected these days, but I've always found it a bit overwhelming. There's something about scrolling through endless posts and comparing your life to others that just doesn't sit well with me. I tried using Facebook a few years back to stay in touch with old classmates and family, but it felt more like a chore than a way to connect. Instagram, in particular, always made me feel like I was missing out on something\u2014like everyone else was living this exciting, curated life while I was just trying to figure things out. I've been more intentional about how I use technology lately, so I limit my time on these platforms and focus more on real, face-to-face interactions. I do follow a few environmental blogs and Spanish learning accounts, just to keep myself inspired, but I'm not someone who needs to be constantly online.

I prefer talking things out one-on-one, whether it's with a friend, my mother, or even a therapist. I think there's something about seeing someone's pain filtered through a screen that makes it feel less real, or at least less immediate.

Some months I'm able to stick to a strict budget, and others, especially when I'm feeling down or overwhelmed, I end up spending more on things like takeout or small indulgences just to feel better. Last month, I think I spent around $1,800, which is actually a bit higher than usual. That was partly because I had to replace my laptop after it stopped working, and I also bought a few new books for my Spanish classes. Normally, I try to keep it around $1,500 to $1,600, with most of that going to rent, groceries, and utilities.

After college, I worked at a local nonprofit focused on environmental conservation, where I helped organize community clean-up events, educated people about sustainable practices, and assisted with grant writing. It was rewarding work, but the pay wasn't great, and the job didn't last long after the organization faced funding cuts. After that, I tried freelancing for a few environmental blogs, writing articles about climate change and sustainability, which was something I was passionate about. But that wasn't stable either, and I found myself struggling to make ends meet. When I dropped out of graduate school, I took a break from working full-time, which was both a relief and a challenge. I've been volunteering part-time at the community center ever since, which has given me a sense of purpose and kept me connected to the people around me.

I even tried tutoring a few students in environmental science on the side, which was both challenging and rewarding. At one point, I was also helping a local artist with a sustainability-themed art installation, which was a completely different kind of work but one that I really enjoyed. Looking back, it was a bit overwhelming trying to do so many things at once, but it also gave me a chance to explore different interests and see what I was truly passionate about. I think that experience taught me that I don't need to stick to one path\u2014sometimes, trying different things helps you find your way, even if it takes longer than you'd like.\n\n",

Talking about my stress levels, coping strategies, and how I manage my monthly budget reminded me of the importance of small, consistent efforts in maintaining balance. I've learned that healing isn't about fixing everything at once\u2014it's about showing up for myself, even on the hardest days. I've also come to appreciate the support I receive from my family, even when it's not always easy to ask for help. These conversations helped me see that staying connected, whether through real-life interactions or mindful financial planning, is essential for my sense of stability and peace. I'm still learning, but I'm grateful for the progress I've made, even if it's not always easy.",

I also received some financial support from my mother when things got really tight, which I'm grateful for, but I know I can't rely on that forever. I've been trying to be more careful with my money, tracking my expenses and setting aside small amounts for savings, but it's still a struggle. I don't make a lot, and I know that's not ideal, but I'm trying to focus on what I can control\u2014like staying healthy, learning new things, and staying connected with the people who matter most. I think it's important to be realistic about where I am financially, even if it doesn't feel like enough.\n\n",

My 'workplace' is really just the community center where I volunteer, and even that isn't a nine-to-five job. I show up when I can, usually on weekends or afternoons, and help with literacy programs, organize small workshops, or just be there for the kids and families who come in. It's not the kind of job that offers health benefits, paid time off, or a steady paycheck, but it does give me a sense of purpose and connection that I really need. I think part of what makes this experience different is that I'm not just showing up for a job\u2014I'm showing up for people, and that makes all the difference. I've learned that work doesn't always have to be about money or stability; sometimes, it's about the relationships you build and the impact you make, even in small ways.\n\n",

There's no real manager or boss in the traditional sense\u2014more like a team of people who all pitch in and support each other. The person who coordinates the programs, let's call her Lisa, is more of a mentor than a supervisor. She's been there for a while and has a real passion for what she does. She's always encouraging, even when things get busy or chaotic, which is something I really value. As for my coworkers, they're a mix of regular volunteers, staff members, and even some of the kids who come in for the literacy programs. I think what makes it work is that everyone has their own role, but there's also a lot of flexibility. Sometimes I'm helping with a workshop, other times I'm just sitting with a kid who needs someone to talk to. It's not perfect, and there are definitely days when things feel overwhelming, but I've come to see that the relationships I've built here are some of the most meaningful ones I have. It's not about titles or hierarchy\u2014it's about showing up and being there for each other, and that's something I really respect.\n\n",

Some weeks I might be there almost every day, especially if there's a big event or a program that needs extra help, and other weeks I might only show up a couple of times if I'm focusing on job applications or personal projects. It's not the kind of schedule that gives you a lot of structure, which can be tough when you're trying to stay motivated or keep a routine. But at the same time, it gives me a lot of flexibility\u2014like if I need to take a day off to go to a therapy session or just have a bad day, I can do that without feeling guilty. I think the unpredictability of it has actually helped me learn to be more adaptable, even if it's not always easy. I don't have the same expectations as someone with a traditional job, and I've come to accept that my work is more about showing up when I can, rather than fitting into a rigid schedule.\n\n",

There are days when I feel frustrated by the uncertainty, especially when I see others around me with more stability, but I'm also learning to appreciate what I do have.

He was pretty dedicated to his job, and I remember him coming home exhausted but always making time for family dinners.

He spent a lot of time on-site, working with contractors and reviewing blueprints, and he was always meticulous about the details.

He was part of a team that designed and oversaw the construction of these structures, making sure they were safe, efficient, and met all the required standards.
