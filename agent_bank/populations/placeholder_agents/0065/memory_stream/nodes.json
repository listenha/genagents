Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAmit Rahman: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Bangladesh and moved to the United States when I was a teenager. My family had just enough to get by, but not much more, so we lived in a modest apartment in Newark, New Jersey. My parents worked hard, both of them with graduate degrees, but their jobs were often unstable. They managed to save enough money to send me to a good school. In terms of my education, I excelled in math and science, which led me to pursue a graduate degree in engineering. However, after graduation, finding a job wasn't easy, and I've been searching for work ever since.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAmit Rahman: One such moment was during my senior year of college. I had a choice between staying in academia and pursuing a Ph.D., or taking a job in industry. I was torn because I loved research and innovation, but I also wanted to see how my skills could impact real-world problems. After much deliberation, I decided to take a job in a tech company, thinking it might give me a broader perspective and experience. Little did I know, the job market would become so challenging, and here I am, still looking for my next opportunity.\n\n",

On one hand, I had to make a decision based on what seemed like the best option at the time, but on the other hand, the job market's challenges were certainly a factor that influenced my path. Looking back, I realize that both choices\u2014staying in academia or entering the industry\u2014were valid, and each would have shaped me differently. But given the circumstances, I felt that gaining practical experience in the tech world was crucial.\n\n",

If they had been more involved, or if there had been more networking events, I might have found a job sooner. Additionally, having a mentor in the industry who could have guided me through the application process and offered advice would have been incredibly helpful.\n\n",

There are days when I feel like I'm making progress, and then there are days when it feels like I'm spinning my wheels. To cope with this, I've been trying to stick to a more structured routine. I've set specific times for checking job applications and networking, which helps me stay organized. Additionally, I've been practicing mindfulness more consistently, whether it's through guided meditations or simply taking a few deep breaths throughout the day. It's not perfect, but it's a step in the right direction.\n\n",

Rent is a bit higher here in Newark compared to where I used to live, so that takes a chunk out of my budget. Groceries are also a bit pricier than I'd like, but I try to buy generic brands and plan my meals to stretch my food budget. Transportation costs can be unpredictable; sometimes I take public transit, and other times I have to use ride-sharing apps to get around. Thankfully, my parents have been contributing to my savings account, which has helped with emergencies and unexpected expenses.\n\n",
