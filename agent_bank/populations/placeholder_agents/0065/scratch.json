  "agent_profile_summary": "Amit Rahman, a 37-year-old software engineering graduate from Bangladesh now living in Newark, New Jersey, has navigated a path marked by resilience and a commitment to growth. Raised in a modest household where both parents held graduate degrees and worked steadily, he moved to the U.S. as a teenager and pursued a graduate degree in engineering, choosing industry experience over academia during a pivotal crossroads in his senior year. Now unemployed but actively seeking work, Amit balances job hunting with volunteering at a local coding club for underprivileged youth, a sustained commitment that reflects his belief in giving back. His journey has been shaped by the tension between professional uncertainty and personal purpose, as he grapples with the emotional toll of the search while relying on family support and a network of mentors. This blend of perseverance, community involvement, and introspection defines how he approaches challenges and connects with others."
