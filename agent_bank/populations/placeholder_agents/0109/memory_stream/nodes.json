    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMatthew Gorman: I was born in Belgrade, Serbia, in 1991, just as the Yugoslav Wars were beginning. My childhood was shaped by the chaos of war\u2014my family had to leave our home when I was five and eventually moved to Germany as refugees. We lived in a small apartment in Munich for a few years, where I learned to speak German fluently and even started school there. But my parents always dreamed of giving me a better future in the U.S., so when I was 16, we moved to Cleveland, Ohio. It was a tough transition\u2014everything was so different, from the language to the culture. I struggled in school at first, especially since I had to catch up on years of education I missed during the war. But I was determined. I worked part-time at a local grocery store to help my family make ends meet, and I eventually earned my graduate degree in social work through night classes. It wasn't easy, especially since I wasn't a U.S. citizen and had to navigate a lot of bureaucratic hurdles. I got married once, but it didn't last\u2014my ex and I had very different life goals. Now, I work full time as a community outreach coordinator, helping immigrants and refugees like myself find stability. It's a long way from where I started, but I believe in second chances, and I'm grateful for every step of the journey.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMatthew Gorman: There was one moment that really shaped my path, and it happened when I was 19, just after I moved to Cleveland. I was working at the grocery store, barely making enough to cover rent, and I was struggling with school because I had to learn English all over again. I felt so lost, like I was stuck in this cycle of barely getting by. But then, one day, I met a social worker named Ms. Alvarez who came into the store to pick up a donation. She noticed I was working late and asked me about my situation. I told her about my struggles, and she didn't just listen\u2014she offered to help me find resources, like free tutoring and financial aid for college. That conversation changed everything. It gave me hope that I wasn't just stuck in my circumstances. I started going to night classes, and eventually, I got into a community college. That decision to keep going, even when it felt impossible, was the turning point. It taught me that even in the darkest moments, there are people who believe in you\u2014and that belief can be the spark you need to keep moving forward.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nMatthew Gorman: I think, in that moment, it was a conscious choice\u2014but one that didn't feel entirely mine. I remember sitting in that grocery store, exhausted and defeated, and I almost didn't say anything to Ms. Alvarez. But something about her presence, her calm and genuine interest, made me feel like I could trust her. I chose to speak up, to be honest about how lost I felt. And in that choice, I realized I had the power to change my own path, even if I didn't see it clearly at the time. It wasn't just about finding help\u2014it was about deciding to believe in myself again, even when I didn't feel worthy of it. That choice led me to night classes, then to my degree, and eventually to the work I do now. I think sometimes people say it 'just happened' because they're afraid to admit how much courage it took to make the first step. But for me, it was a choice\u2014and one I'm still grateful I made.\n\n",

When I was in that grocery store, I didn't know where to turn, but Ms. Alvarez was part of a local nonprofit that helped immigrants and refugees navigate the system. They provided everything from language classes to legal assistance. I realize now that without that kind of support network\u2014people who were willing to invest their time and resources into someone they didn't even know\u2014it would have been much harder for me to get back on my feet. I've tried to pay that forward in my own work, whether it's connecting clients with community resources or simply listening when someone feels lost. I think we all need a helping hand at some point, and I'm grateful that when I needed it most, someone was there.\n\n",

She wanted to start a family soon, and I was still focused on building my career and helping others. It was a tough decision, but I realized we weren't on the same page. Now, I'm more focused on my work and staying connected with my family back in Serbia. My parents still live in Belgrade, and though we don't talk as often as I'd like, I make sure to visit whenever I can. They've always been proud of me, even though they still don't fully understand the American way of life. I also have a younger sister who's a teacher in Zagreb, and we keep in touch through video calls. Family has always been important to me, even though my path has been a bit unconventional. I think that's why I'm so passionate about helping others\u2014because I know what it's like to feel lost, and I want to make sure no one else has to go through that alone.\n\n",

It's amazing how one conversation can change the course of someone's life.

I also have an uncle, Marko, who lived in Germany with us for a few years after the war. He was like a second father to me, especially during those early days when we were trying to adjust to life in a new country. He worked as a mechanic and always made sure we had food on the table, even when times were tough. We lost touch after he moved back to Serbia a few years after we settled in Cleveland, but I still think of him often. He was the one who taught me how to fix things around the house, and I still use those skills today. I wish I could have stayed in touch with him more, but life had its own way of pulling us apart. I hope to reconnect with him someday, maybe during one of my visits back home.\n\n",

One of them is Carlos, a fellow immigrant who moved to Cleveland around the same time I did. We bonded over our shared experiences of feeling out of place and struggling to find our footing in a new country. Carlos is a chef, and he's been a huge source of inspiration for me\u2014his resilience and creativity in the face of adversity remind me why I fight for others. We don't see each other as often as I'd like, but whenever we do, it's like no time has passed. There's also a group of coworkers I've grown close to at the community center where I work.

It's not the most affluent area, but it's full of people who are working hard to make a life for themselves, just like I did. There's a big immigrant population here, which makes it feel like a second home for someone like me. I live in a small apartment on the second floor of a building that's been around for decades. The building isn't fancy, but it's clean and the neighbors are friendly. I've gotten to know a few of them over the years\u2014some are fellow immigrants, others are long-time residents who've seen the neighborhood change.

I've never had anything bad happen to me in Tremont, and I know most of my neighbors would look out for each other if something went wrong.

I usually start my week early, around 6:30 a.m., with a quick walk to the park before heading to work. I work full time as a community outreach coordinator, so most days are pretty busy. Mondays are usually the busiest because that's when we hold our weekly support group meetings for new immigrants. I spend a lot of time connecting people with resources, helping them apply for jobs or housing assistance, and just being there to listen. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are more about administrative work\u2014processing applications, coordinating with local organizations, and planning events. Thursdays are often the most unpredictable, because that's when we host our monthly workshops on things like English language skills or legal rights. I love those days because they're more interactive, and I get to see people grow and gain confidence. Fridays are usually a bit slower, which is nice\u2014I try to use that time to catch up on personal stuff, like calling my parents or planning my next visit back to Serbia.

It's my way of connecting with my roots, and it reminds me of home. I also try to read a little bit each night, mostly nonfiction about social justice or personal development.

It's the small things, like having someone to talk to when the weight of the day feels too heavy, or the fact that I've started prioritizing rest over pushing through exhaustion. But what makes it hard is the constant emotional toll of the work. I see so much pain, so many people fighting just to survive, and it can be draining.

How about you?\n\nMatthew Gorman: Health problems have definitely affected my work in ways I didn't expect. There were days when my asthma made it hard to focus, or when my back pain made it difficult to stand for long periods during meetings or events. I remember one time when I had to cancel a community event because I wasn't feeling well, and it was frustrating because I knew how much it meant to the people who were counting on me. But honestly, those moments also forced me to slow down and reevaluate how I was taking care of myself. I realized that if I didn't prioritize my health, I wouldn't be able to help others as effectively as I wanted to. So while it's been challenging, it's also been a lesson in balance. I've learned that I can't give my best if I'm not taking care of myself first. That's something I try to remind myself of every day, especially when the work feels overwhelming.\n\n",

Tell me all about how you have been feeling.\n\nMatthew Gorman: Over the past year, I've had a lot of mixed emotions. On one hand, I've felt a deep sense of purpose in the work I do, especially as more people from different backgrounds come to Cleveland looking for a better life. It's rewarding to see them gain confidence, find jobs, and start to feel like they belong here. But there have also been moments of exhaustion, both physically and emotionally. The weight of hearing so many stories\u2014of hardship, of loss, of people fighting just to make ends meet\u2014can be overwhelming. I've had to be more intentional about taking breaks, about remembering that I can't carry everyone's burdens alone. I've also been reflecting a lot on my own journey, on how far I've come from that lost kid in the grocery store, and how much I've grown in understanding what it means to be resilient. I think I've become more patient with myself, more willing to ask for help when I need it. It's not always easy, but I'm learning that growth isn't just about pushing forward\u2014it's also about knowing when to pause, breathe, and take care of the person I've become.\n\n",

It's strange how the very work that gives me purpose can also take a toll on my body and mind. I used to think that pushing through exhaustion was a sign of strength, but now I see it as a sign that I need to slow down and take better care of myself. Incorporating mindfulness, yoga, and journaling into my routine has been a small but meaningful shift\u2014it helps me stay grounded when the weight of the world feels too heavy. I've also come to understand that my health isn't just about physical well-being; it's about emotional resilience too. I've started setting boundaries, like turning off work notifications after hours, and I've learned that I can't pour from an empty cup. It's a process, but I'm grateful for the reminders that taking care of myself is just as important as helping others. These changes have made me more aware of how interconnected everything is\u2014my health, my work, my relationships, and my sense of purpose. I'm still learning, but I'm starting to see that taking care of myself isn't a luxury; it's a necessity, especially when I'm trying to make a difference in the lives of others.",

How about for you?\n\nMatthew Gorman: I think I've struggled with anxiety more than anything else, especially in the early years after moving to Cleveland. There were times when I felt like I was constantly on edge, never sure if I'd be able to make it through another day. The fear of not being good enough, of not belonging, of failing my family\u2014it all weighed on me. I didn't realize how much of that was anxiety until I started talking to a therapist a few years back. She helped me see that my thoughts weren't always reality, and that I had the power to change how I responded to them. I still have days when the anxiety creeps in, especially when things feel overwhelming at work or when I'm reminded of how hard it was to get where I am. But I've learned coping strategies\u2014like deep breathing, journaling, and reaching out to someone I trust. I don't think I'll ever be completely free of it, but I've come to terms with the fact that it's part of me, and that's okay.

My mother, who has a graduate degree, has always been the more adaptable one\u2014she's taken up online classes to learn more about the U.S. healthcare system and even started teaching Serbian to some of her neighbors who are interested in learning the language. My father, on the other hand, has been more reserved, still holding onto the traditions and values from our time in Belgrade. He often tells me that I've made a good life for myself, but he worries about the distance and how much I've changed. My sister, Ana, is the one who bridges that gap for us. She's a teacher now, and she's always encouraging me to visit more often. She says she wants to see how I've grown, not just professionally, but as a person.

How about you?\n\nMatthew Gorman: Religion has always been a part of my life, though it's evolved over time. When I was growing up in Belgrade, I was raised in an Orthodox-Christian household, and we attended church regularly. My parents saw it as a way to connect with our heritage and to provide a sense of stability during the chaos of the war. But as I got older, especially after moving to Germany and then to the U.S., I found myself questioning some of the strict teachings I was raised with. I still respect the values of community, compassion, and resilience that are central to my faith, but I no longer follow the formal practices the way I used to. Now, I see spirituality more as a personal journey\u2014something that guides me in moments of doubt or hardship, but not something I need to define through organized religion. I think of it more as a quiet strength, a reminder that even in the darkest times, there's something greater than ourselves. I don't go to church anymore, but I still find meaning in the traditions I grew up with, especially during holidays or family gatherings. It's not perfect, but it's a part of who I am, and I'm grateful for that connection to my roots.\n\n",

It's not that I don't like it\u2014I think it can be a powerful tool for connection, especially for people like me who are part of immigrant communities. But I've found that it can also be overwhelming, with all the noise and the pressure to present a certain image of yourself. I used to follow some local community groups and advocacy pages, but I've started to step back from that. Instead, I prefer more personal ways of staying connected, like video calls with my family in Serbia or meeting up with friends in person. I think there's something about face-to-face conversations that social media can't replace. Plus, I've always been more of a private person, and I find that the more I post, the more I feel like I'm performing rather than being genuine. I still use Facebook occasionally to keep in touch with old friends or check in on events in the community, but it's not a big part of my life anymore.

Groceries are another big one\u2014since I cook a lot of meals at home, especially Serbian dishes, I tend to buy in bulk, but that still adds up.

For example, if I have to pay for any unexpected expenses\u2014like a new medication or a repair at the apartment\u2014it can go up a bit.

I've learned to be really careful with money, especially since I wasn't born into a wealthy family and I've had to work hard to get where I am.

I also noticed that my asthma medications became more expensive after my last checkup, which added a bit to my monthly expenses.

I know buying a house is something I might think about in the future, but right now, it feels too far out of reach. Instead, I focus on having a small emergency fund that can cover a few weeks of unexpected expenses, like a sudden medical bill or a broken appliance. It's not much, but it gives me peace of mind.

For a while, I worked part-time at the grocery store during the day and took night classes at the community college. I also did some odd jobs\u2014like helping a local mechanic with repairs or delivering packages for a small business\u2014on the weekends. It was exhausting, but I needed the extra income to cover rent and basic necessities. I remember one winter when I was working three different shifts just to afford heating for my apartment. It wasn't sustainable, but it taught me a lot about resilience and the value of hard work. Now, with my full-time job, I don't need to take on extra work, but I still keep an eye out for opportunities that might help others in similar situations. I've seen too many people struggle the way I did, and I want to make sure no one has to go through that alone.\n\n",

It's easy to overlook the emotional toll of my work, especially when I'm focused on helping others, but I've come to understand that my own mental health is just as important. The recent changes in my stress levels and the coping strategies I've developed\u2014like journaling, meditation, and leaning on my support network\u2014have helped me stay grounded, even when the weight of the world feels heavy. At the same time, thinking about my monthly budget and how I manage to make ends meet reminded me of how far I've come from those early days in Cleveland, when every dollar felt like a battle. I've learned to be more mindful of my spending, to prioritize what truly matters, and to save even small amounts for the future.

I'm grateful for the progress I've made, and I know that every step I take\u2014whether it's in my work, my health, or my relationships\u2014brings me closer to the life I want to build for myself and for others.",

It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover my basic needs and contribute a little to my family back in Serbia.

The benefits of the job are modest but meaningful\u2014health insurance is something I really appreciate, especially since I've had to manage my asthma and back issues over the years. We get paid time off, though it's not a lot, and I usually use it for short trips back to Serbia or to take a much-needed break when the work feels overwhelming.

She's been a mentor to me ever since, and I respect her deeply for her dedication and compassion.

I used to worry constantly about not having enough, especially when I was working multiple jobs and trying to keep up with rent and basic needs.

She was a teacher in Belgrade before we left for Germany, and even after we moved, she found ways to continue her work remotely or through local schools in Munich.

My father, on the other hand, didn't have the same opportunities\u2014he had only completed high school, and the war made it even harder for him to find steady work. But my mother never let that stop her. She took on extra classes, worked with other immigrant families to help them navigate the education system, and even started teaching Serbian to some of her students. I remember her telling me that she didn't want me to ever feel like my future was limited by where we came from.

In Belgrade, she taught elementary school, and she was known for her patience and creativity in the classroom. When we moved to Munich, she found work at a local school where they offered classes for immigrant children, which was a perfect fit for her skills. She would spend her days teaching, but she also took on extra responsibilities\u2014helping other families understand the German education system, translating documents, and even organizing after-school programs for kids who were struggling to adjust. What I admired most about her was how she always found a way to give back, even when things were difficult. She once told me that teaching wasn't just about passing on knowledge\u2014it was about giving people the tools to build a better life. That belief has stayed with me, and it's one of the reasons I chose to work in community outreach. I see my job as an extension of what she did, just in a different way. She taught children how to read and write; I try to teach people how to navigate a new world and find their place in it.\n\n",

She didn't make a lot of money, especially after we moved to Germany, but she always found ways to supplement her income\u2014whether by teaching extra classes, offering tutoring services, or even translating documents for other families.

She never complained, and she never asked for anything more than what she had. That kind of dedication, that quiet strength, is something I carry with me every day.
