  "agent_profile_summary": "Matthew Gorman, a 32-year-old community outreach coordinator in Cleveland, Ohio, grew up in Belgrade, Serbia, during the Yugoslav Wars, before becoming a refugee in Germany and later settling in the U.S. His life took a decisive turn at 19 when a chance encounter with a social worker at his part-time grocery store job led him to pursue night classes and eventually a graduate degree in social work, transforming his path from survival to service. Now, he dedicates his career to helping immigrants and refugees navigate the challenges he once faced, working full-time at a local nonprofit where he coordinates support groups and connects clients with essential resources. His commitment to community is deeply rooted in his own experiences of displacement and resilience, and he balances this with personal routines like cooking Serbian meals and practicing mindfulness. Matthew’s life is shaped by a tension between the stability he now enjoys and the ongoing fight for systemic change, driving him to both support others and reflect on his own journey of growth and belonging."
