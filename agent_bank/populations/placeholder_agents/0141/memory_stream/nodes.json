Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nElizabeth Ong: I was born and raised in Providence, Rhode Island, in a small, close-knit Irish-American family. My parents worked hard to provide for us, though we never had much money growing up. My father had an associate's degree in engineering, and he worked as a mechanic, while my mother, who only finished high school, worked part-time as a clerk at a local store. We lived in a modest home on Elm Street, and I remember my childhood being filled with the sounds of my mother's voice reading stories to me before bed and my father tinkering with old cars in the garage. I always felt a strong sense of community in Providence, and I was lucky to have a stable family life, even if we weren't wealthy. I was a good student, though I didn't have access to many resources. I went to college on a scholarship, eventually earning a graduate degree in social work, which led me to the job I have now. I married my husband, Michael, in our early 30s, and we've been raising our two kids in the same neighborhood I grew up in. Life hasn't been easy, but I've always believed in working hard and staying grounded.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nElizabeth Ong: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped my life. I was in my second year of college, studying for my bachelor's degree, and I had the chance to either stay in my local community college or transfer to a larger university in Boston. I was really torn because I wanted to be close to my family and the support system I had, but I also knew that the bigger university had better resources and more opportunities. In the end, I chose to stay local, and that decision was both a blessing and a challenge. I had to work part-time while going to school, which made things harder, but it also taught me resilience and the value of community. Looking back, I think that choice helped me stay grounded and connected to my roots, which has been important in my career in social work. I often tell my students that sometimes the path that seems smaller is the one that leads you to the right place at the right time.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nElizabeth Ong: I think it was a conscious choice, though it didn't feel like one at the time. I remember sitting at my kitchen table, staring at the application for the university in Boston, and feeling this mix of excitement and fear. I knew if I left, I might not come back, and I wasn't sure I could handle being so far from home. My parents were supportive, but they also didn't have the means to help me move or support me financially if I left. I felt like I was being pulled in two directions \u2014 the pull of opportunity and the pull of family. In the end, I made a decision that felt right for me then, even if it wasn't the easiest path. I think that's what makes life meaningful \u2014 making choices that align with who you are, even when they're hard.\n\n",

My high school counselor was actually very supportive and encouraged me to apply to the university in Boston, but I didn't feel ready to take that step. I think I was afraid of leaving everything I knew behind. Looking back, I wish I had reached out more to people in my community or maybe even sought out financial aid resources that I wasn't aware of at the time. But I also think that the challenges I faced helped shape who I am today. I learned the importance of perseverance and the strength that comes from staying close to the people you love. In my work as a social worker, I always try to remind others that it's okay to ask for help \u2014 sometimes the right support can make all the difference.\n\n",

My husband, Michael, is a teacher at the local high school, and we met through a mutual friend when I was volunteering at the community center. We got married in our early 30s, after both of us had taken some time to figure out what we wanted in life. Our children, Liam and Sophie, are 8 and 5, and they live with us in the same neighborhood I grew up in. It's important to me to raise them close to family and in the community that shaped me. My mother still lives just a few blocks away, and she helps out with the kids whenever she can. I think having that support system is something I value deeply, especially since I know what it's like to grow up without a lot of resources. Being a mother has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, though it's also incredibly challenging. I often reflect on how my own childhood influenced the way I parent \u2014 I want my kids to feel safe, loved, and encouraged to dream big, even if we don't have a lot.\n\n",

He lives in Massachusetts now, where he works as a carpenter. We're very close, even though we don't see each other as often as I'd like. He was always the adventurous one growing up, and I think that's why he ended up moving away. We talk often on the phone, and whenever he comes back to visit, we spend days catching up and reminiscing about our childhood. My parents are still very much a part of my life, and I feel lucky to have them nearby. My father, though he's retired now, still enjoys fixing things around the house, and my mother keeps a close eye on the kids when I'm busy with work. Our family has always been about support and love, and I think that's something I carry with me every day in my job as a social worker.

Are there people outside of your family who are important to you?\n\nElizabeth Ong: Yes, there are a few friends who have been important to me over the years. One of them is Sarah, who I met in college. She was one of the few people who encouraged me to pursue social work, even when I wasn't sure I had the confidence to do it. We've been friends for over 20 years now, and even though she moved to California a few years back, we stay in touch through letters and video calls. She's the one who always reminds me that I'm capable of more than I sometimes believe. Then there's my husband's best friend, James, who's been like a brother to me. He's the one who helped me fix my car when I first moved out on my own, and he's always there with advice or a shoulder to lean on.

Providence has always had a mix of old and new, with historic buildings standing next to modern apartments, and I love that about it. There's a small park just a few blocks from my house where the kids play, and it's the same one I used to run through as a child. The people here are friendly, and there's always someone willing to lend a hand, whether it's a neighbor helping with a broken fence or someone stopping by to check in on you when you're having a tough day. I think that's why I chose to raise my family here \u2014 because I want my kids to know what it's like to be part of something bigger than themselves.

It's more of a quiet, unspoken kind of safety \u2014 the kind that comes from knowing your neighbors, from having people who look out for one another. There have been times when I've walked home late at night and seen someone I know standing on their porch, waving or calling out to make sure I'm okay. That kind of care makes a difference. I've also had moments where I've felt the weight of the neighborhood's challenges \u2014 the struggles with poverty, the occasional conflict, the lack of resources \u2014 but I think that's what makes the safety here even more meaningful. It's not about being protected from everything, but about being part of something that supports you through it all. I want my kids to grow up knowing that safety isn't just about being shielded from harm, but about being surrounded by people who care enough to help when things get tough.\n\n",

There's a rhythm to life here that I've always found comforting \u2014 the same streets, the same local shops, the same friendly faces. But it's not without its challenges.

Those habits feel natural to me, almost like part of who I am. But what makes it hard is the constant balancing act between work, family, and self-care.

About a year ago, I started experiencing more frequent flare-ups of the back pain I've dealt with for years. It got to the point where I was having trouble bending down to pick up the kids or even sitting for long periods at work. I finally made an appointment with my doctor, and she confirmed that the pain was related to old injuries from when I was working part-time in college and helping out around the house. She recommended physical therapy, which I started, and it's been helping \u2014 though it's been a slow process. I also had a minor fall last winter while walking on an icy patch near the park, which gave me a sprained ankle. It wasn't serious, but it was a reminder that I need to be more careful, especially as I get older. Overall, these experiences have made me more aware of my body and more committed to taking the time to rest and recover when I need to. I've started incorporating more gentle stretching into my daily routine and have been more mindful of how I lift things, especially when I'm helping the kids with their homework or doing chores around the house.

It was humbling, because I've always prided myself on being strong and capable \u2014 not just for my job, but for my family. But what I've learned is that being strong doesn't mean never needing help. I've had to ask my husband to take over more of the household chores, and I've had to be more honest with my boss about when I need to slow down. It's not easy, but it's taught me that taking care of myself isn't selfish \u2014 it's necessary. If I can't be there for my kids or my work, then I'm not being the kind of mother or social worker I want to be. I've also started relying more on my support system \u2014 my parents, my brother, even my friends \u2014 to help me through the tough days. It's a reminder that no one has to go through life alone, and that even when things get hard, there's always a way forward \u2014 as long as you're willing to ask for help.\n\n",

Tell me all about how you have been feeling.\n\nElizabeth Ong: Over the past year, I've had a lot of mixed emotions \u2014 there's been both growth and struggle. On one hand, I feel more grounded than ever in my role as a mother and a social worker. I've started to find a better balance between my work and my family, and I've learned to be more patient with myself when things don't go perfectly. I've also been really grateful for the support I've received from my husband, my parents, and my friends, especially during the times when my back pain flared up and I needed to slow down. But there have also been moments of deep exhaustion, both physically and emotionally. Raising two kids, working full time, and trying to stay healthy while also helping others in my community can be overwhelming at times. I've had to confront some of my own limitations and accept that I can't do everything on my own. That's been a hard lesson, but it's also been a kind of freedom \u2014 knowing that it's okay to lean on others, to ask for help, and to take time for myself when I need it. I think the past year has been a reminder that life is a constant process of learning, adapting, and finding strength in the people around you \u2014 even when things feel heavy.\n\n",

I've come to understand that taking care of my body is just as important as taking care of my kids or my job.

There were days when I would wake up feeling like I had to be everything to everyone, and that pressure would weigh on me. I remember one particular winter when the back pain was really bad, and I was also dealing with a heavy caseload at work. I felt like I was failing at being the strong, capable person I wanted to be. But what I've come to understand is that anxiety isn't always about something huge \u2014 it can be about the everyday stress of trying to keep everything together. I've started talking more openly about how I feel with my husband and my friends, and I've also begun practicing mindfulness and deep breathing when I feel overwhelmed. It's not a perfect solution, but it's helped me recognize when I need to pause and take a step back.

I was raised Catholic, and even though I don't attend Mass as often as I used to, the values I learned growing up \u2014 like kindness, compassion, and the importance of community \u2014 still shape the way I live. My faith has been especially important during the harder times, like when I was struggling with my health or feeling overwhelmed by work and family. I find comfort in the idea that there's something bigger than myself, even if I don't always feel close to God in a traditional sense. I also appreciate the sense of belonging that comes with being part of a faith community, even if it's not something I engage with every week. For my kids, I want them to know that faith is about more than just going to church \u2014 it's about living with integrity, showing love to others, and finding strength in the things that matter most.

I find that the more I stay connected to the people around me in person, the less I feel the need to be online.

I've seen how it can affect people's mental health, especially young people, and I want my kids to grow up understanding that their worth isn't tied to likes or followers.

When I was going through my back pain or feeling overwhelmed with work, it was my husband, my parents, or my friends who showed up for me, not a post or a message.

I think the biggest change has been in how I cope with that stress. Before, I used to push through it, thinking that if I just worked harder or stayed busy, I could handle anything. But lately, I've been learning to pause and breathe when I feel overwhelmed. I've started journaling more, just to get my thoughts out and make sense of what's going on. I also find that talking things through with my husband or my parents helps a lot \u2014 they've always been good at listening without judgment. I've even tried some gentle yoga in the evenings, which has been a nice way to unwind after a long day. It's not always easy to slow down, especially when there's so much to do, but I'm starting to see that taking time to care for my emotional well-being is just as important as taking care of my body.

Groceries are another big one \u2014 especially with two kids who are always hungry, and I try to feed them well even on a budget.

For example, during the winter months, our heating bill went up quite a bit, which is something we're used to in Providence \u2014 the cold can be brutal. We also had a few unexpected expenses, like when Liam needed new soccer cleats mid-season and Sophie's art class had a special materials fee. On the other hand, there were times when we saved a bit more, like during the summer when we didn't need as much heating and we were able to buy groceries in bulk. I also noticed that our utility bills tend to be higher in the summer because we use the air conditioner more, especially with the kids running around the house and the apartment not being the most energy-efficient. But what's interesting is that even with these fluctuations, we've managed to stay on track by budgeting carefully and relying on the support of our community.

That said, I do take on some additional responsibilities that aren't paid, like volunteering at the food pantry on weekends or helping out with neighborhood events. I also find myself stepping in to help friends or family members in need, whether it's babysitting for a few hours or helping someone with a small repair around the house. I think those things are part of the fabric of life here \u2014 it's not about having multiple jobs, but about being part of a community that supports one another in whatever way we can. I've always believed that work isn't just about earning a paycheck, but about contributing to something bigger, and I feel like I'm doing that, even if it's not in a traditional way.\n\n",

It also made me think about how my faith, though not always practiced in a traditional way, has been a quiet source of strength for me, especially during difficult times. I've come to understand that my worth isn't tied to being perfect or having everything together \u2014 it's about showing up for my family, being kind to myself, and finding comfort in the values that have shaped me. It's also made me more aware of how my financial situation, while not always easy, is something I manage with care and support from my community. These reflections have helped me see that my emotional and financial well-being are not separate things \u2014 they're both about being connected to the people and values that ground me, even when life feels overwhelming.",

Both my husband and I work full time, which helps, but it's still a tight budget. Michael earns a bit more than I do, so we split the expenses accordingly. I think what keeps us afloat is the fact that we're both committed to our jobs and to each other. We don't have a lot of luxuries, but we make do with what we have. I also feel lucky that I have a job I believe in \u2014 one that gives me purpose and allows me to help others, even if it's not always easy.

The benefits of the job are pretty standard \u2014 health insurance, which is a huge relief, especially with my back issues and the fact that I see a chiropractor regularly. We also get paid time off, which is something I've learned to use wisely, even if it's just a few days here and there to recharge. I don't get a lot of vacation days, but I do have sick time, which has been helpful when I've had flare-ups or needed to rest. What I appreciate most about the job, though, is the sense of purpose it gives me. I know that what I do here matters \u2014 whether it's helping a family find housing or just being there to listen to someone who feels like they're at their lowest.

I've been lucky to have a manager who understands the weight of what we do here. She's not just focused on the numbers or the efficiency of our programs; she genuinely cares about the people we serve and the people who work here.

Most weeks, I have the same core hours \u2014 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. \u2014 but depending on the needs of the community center, I might stay a bit later or come in a little earlier. Sometimes, if there's a support group that runs late or if I need to catch up on paperwork, I'll stay until 6 or 7.

I think that flexibility is one of the things that makes this job work for me \u2014 it allows me to balance my responsibilities at work with the ones I have at home. It's not always perfect, but it gives me the freedom to be present for my family without feeling like I'm constantly rushing.

He was always teaching me how things worked, whether it was the engine of a car or the way a simple lever could lift something heavy. My mother's job was different, but just as important. She worked as a clerk at a local store, and her days were filled with counting inventory, helping customers, and keeping the registers running smoothly. She always said that her job wasn't glamorous, but it gave her a sense of purpose \u2014 knowing that she was helping people get what they needed, even if it was just a loaf of bread or a bottle of milk.
