  "agent_profile_summary": "Elizabeth Ong, a 39-year-old social worker in Providence, Rhode Island, grew up in a modest Irish-American household where hard work and community support were central to daily life. She chose to stay in her hometown for college, balancing part-time work with her studies, a decision that rooted her in the community she now serves as a social worker at a local community center. Her role involves listening to and supporting families facing housing, mental health, and domestic challenges, a commitment she traces back to her own upbringing. Elizabeth’s life is shaped by a deep connection to her neighborhood, where she raises her two children with the same sense of stability and care she received as a child. She navigates the tension between her demanding job and family life with resilience, often relying on her husband, parents, and close friends for support. Her values—community, resilience, and empathy—are evident in both her work and her efforts to maintain a balanced, grounded life."
