  "agent_profile_summary": "Deborah Rogers, a 36-year-old Lithuanian-born resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts, lives with her husband Daniel and their six-year-old daughter Sophie in a rented apartment that feels like home. Raised in a family that valued education and tradition, she moved to the U.S. at 16 and later pursued political science at Harvard, where she met Daniel and committed to a career in education reform after a pivotal experience volunteering with a Syrian refugee girl named Amina. Today, Deborah works part-time as a policy consultant, volunteers at a Jewish community center, and balances her professional and family life with intention, prioritizing Sophie’s education and cultural heritage. Her life is shaped by a sustained commitment to social justice and community, and she navigates the tension between her professional ambitions and the demands of motherhood, often reflecting on how to pass on her values to the next generation."
