Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nDeborah Rogers: I was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, to a family that valued education and tradition. My parents were both well-educated\u2014my father had a graduate degree in engineering, and my mother had a bachelor's in literature. We lived a comfortable life, and I grew up speaking both Lithuanian and English at home. When I was 16, my family moved to the United States, settling in Massachusetts. It was a big change, but I was lucky to have parents who encouraged me to adapt quickly. I attended a private high school in Cambridge, where I excelled academically and became involved in theater and community service. I went on to study political science at Harvard, where I also met my husband, who is a software developer. We got married right after college, and we've been working to build a life together ever since. I've always been passionate about social justice and civic engagement, which is why I identify so strongly with the Democratic Party. My career has taken me in a few different directions\u2014first as a policy analyst, then as a part-time consultant in education reform. I also volunteer with a local Jewish community center, which keeps me connected to my heritage and gives me a sense of purpose.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nDeborah Rogers: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped the direction of my life. It happened during my sophomore year at Harvard, when I was working as a research assistant for a professor studying educational equity in immigrant communities. I was also volunteering at a local community center that served refugee families. One day, I met a young girl named Amina, who had recently arrived from Syria. She was struggling with the language barrier and felt completely isolated. I spent time helping her with her schoolwork and connecting her with resources, and through that experience, I saw firsthand how systemic barriers could affect someone's ability to thrive. It made me realize that policy isn't just abstract\u2014it has real, human consequences. That moment solidified my decision to focus my career on education reform and policy work, because I wanted to create systems that supported people like Amina. It also deepened my commitment to social justice and made me more determined to use my voice and my position to advocate for those who are often overlooked.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nDeborah Rogers: For me, it was a conscious choice, though not one I made lightly. I had been considering different paths\u2014maybe law, or even academia\u2014but after spending time with Amina and seeing the impact that lack of support could have on someone's life, I realized that I wanted to be part of the solution, not just study it from a distance. I chose to pursue a master's in public policy, which allowed me to combine my passion for education with my desire to effect change. It wasn't just about making a decision; it was about aligning my values with my actions. I wanted to be someone who could stand up for others, who could help build systems that were more equitable and inclusive. That moment with Amina didn't just change my career path\u2014it changed the way I see the world, and it's something I carry with me every day.\n\n",

In fact, I remember that the community center where I met Amina had a volunteer coordinator named Mr. Thompson, who was incredibly supportive. He didn't just hand me a list of tasks\u2014he took the time to understand my goals and encouraged me to think about how my work there could extend beyond the walls of the center. He also connected me with a local nonprofit that focused on immigrant education, which opened my eyes to the broader landscape of advocacy and policy work. Without people like him, and without the resources provided by that community center, I don't think I would have had the clarity or the confidence to make the choice I did. It's a reminder that while individual moments can be pivotal, they are often shaped by the support systems around us.\n\n",

Do you have a partner, or children?\n\nDeborah Rogers: Yes, I have a partner\u2014my husband, Daniel, and we have a daughter named Sophie, who is six years old. Daniel and I met during my first year at Harvard, actually. He was working on his computer science degree, and I was involved in a student government initiative focused on campus accessibility. We bonded over our shared belief in using our skills to make the world a better place. We got married shortly after graduation, and we moved to Cambridge, where we've been raising Sophie together. She's a curious and creative child, and I try to instill in her the same values that were important to me growing up\u2014like kindness, education, and standing up for what's right. Daniel works full-time as a software developer, but he's also very involved in our family life. We have a small but close-knit circle of friends, and we try to make time for community events, especially those that support immigrant families and Jewish causes. Sophie has already started showing an interest in social justice, which is both heartening and humbling. It's amazing how quickly children pick up on the values we model for them, and I hope she grows up to be as passionate and compassionate as she already is.\n\n",

My parents have always been a source of strength and guidance for me. Even though we moved to the U.S. when I was 16, they made sure to keep our Lithuanian heritage alive in our home. My father, in particular, has always been a big advocate for education, and he often shares stories about his own childhood in Vilnius, which has helped me appreciate where I come from. My sister Elena is a few years younger than me, and she's a nurse in Boston. We're very close, and even though we lead different lives, we make an effort to stay in touch and support each other. She was the one who encouraged me to take a break from my full-time work a few years ago and focus more on my family, which I deeply appreciate.

One of them is Rachel, a close friend from college who works in nonprofit advocacy. We met through a women's leadership program, and she's been a constant source of support and inspiration. She's the one who first encouraged me to run for a local school board position a few years ago, even though I was hesitant at first. Her belief in my ability to make a difference gave me the confidence to take that step. Then there's Dr. Thompson, the volunteer coordinator at the community center where I met Amina. He's been a mentor in many ways, offering guidance not just in my career but in how I approach life with empathy and purpose. I also stay in touch with a few colleagues from my time at Harvard, especially those who share my passion for social justice.

I live in a quiet part of the neighborhood, just a few blocks from the Harvard campus, which is both convenient and inspiring.

The streets are well-lit, and there are always neighbors who know each other and are willing to help if something's wrong. I think part of that safety comes from the way people engage with each other\u2014whether it's through local events, volunteering, or just casual conversations on the sidewalk. It's not perfect, of course, but I feel confident that if something were to happen, there would be people here who would step in to help.

But there are also moments when the pace of city life can feel overwhelming, especially with work and family responsibilities. I sometimes miss the slower, more quiet pace of Lithuania, where life wasn't as fast-moving. That said, I've come to appreciate the opportunities that come with living in a place like Cambridge\u2014access to cultural events, educational resources, and a diverse group of people who are always pushing for progress. I also have to say that being part of the Jewish community here has been meaningful. The local synagogue and the community center are places where I can connect with my heritage and find support.

She attends a public elementary school in Cambridge, and the days are pretty structured. She has a full day of classes, and then she comes home around 3 p.m. After school, she usually has some time to eat a snack and rest before heading to her after-school activities. She's in a robotics club on Mondays and Wednesdays, which she absolutely loves. It's a great way for her to explore her interest in science and technology, and I've been helping her with some of the projects when I can. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, she goes to a community art class, where she gets to express herself creatively.

There have been moments of deep reflection, especially as I've navigated Sophie's growing awareness of the world around her and how it works. She's started asking questions about fairness, about why some people have more than others, and it's brought me back to the lessons I learned from Amina and the experiences that shaped my path. I've also been feeling more connected to my community, especially through the Jewish community center and the work I do with young women who are passionate about social justice. It's been a year of balance\u2014sometimes it feels like I'm juggling too much, but other times, I feel like I'm exactly where I need to be. I've also been trying to be more present in the little moments, like Sophie's laughter, the smell of my mother's traditional Lithuanian soup, or the quiet moments of reflection in the morning.

How about you?\n\nDeborah Rogers: For me, religion and spirituality are deeply woven into the fabric of my life. Growing up Jewish in Lithuania, my family observed traditions and holidays with a sense of pride and connection to our heritage. Even after moving to the United States, those roots have remained strong. Being part of the Jewish community here in Cambridge has been a source of comfort and belonging, especially during times when I've felt the weight of the world. I find meaning in the rituals\u2014like lighting the Sabbath candles, celebrating Passover with my family, or attending services at the local synagogue. It's not just about following traditions; it's about feeling connected to something larger than myself, to a history that has shaped who I am. Spiritually, I also find peace in moments of reflection, whether it's through prayer, meditation, or simply being in nature. I believe that faith is about more than doctrine\u2014it's about compassion, justice, and the values we live by every day. For me, being Jewish is not just an identity; it's a way of life that guides my choices, my relationships, and my commitment to making the world a better place.\n\n",

I also follow a few Jewish community pages and advocacy groups that align with my values, which helps me stay informed about issues that matter to me. I don't use Instagram much, but I do occasionally post photos of Sophie's art projects or our family meals, especially when we're making traditional Lithuanian dishes. It's a way to share our culture and keep my parents connected, since they don't use social media as much. I also use LinkedIn professionally, as it's a good platform for networking with other consultants in education reform. Overall, I try to use these platforms mindfully\u2014more as a tool for connection and learning rather than a source of distraction.

There have been moments when I've posted about my struggles with hypertension or the stress of balancing everything, and I've received messages of encouragement from friends, colleagues, and even people I don't know personally but who share similar experiences.

Healthcare costs have also been a significant part of our budget\u2014especially with my hypertension management, which includes regular doctor visits, medication, and occasional physical therapy sessions.

We typically allocate around $2,500 for housing, which includes our mortgage and some maintenance costs. Groceries come in at about $1,000, and that's on the higher side because I like to prepare traditional Lithuanian meals, which sometimes require specialty ingredients.

For example, during the winter months, our heating costs went up significantly, which is something I didn't anticipate when we moved here. I remember one particularly cold January when the utility bill was almost double what it was in the summer. That was a wake-up call for us to be more mindful of our energy usage, so we started using space heaters more strategically and dressing in layers to stay warm. Then there were the holidays\u2014Hanukkah and Passover, in particular\u2014when we spent more on groceries and gifts for family. We also had a few unexpected expenses, like Sophie's school field trip fees and a sudden increase in the cost of her art supplies. On the other hand, there were months when our bills were more predictable, like in the spring when we didn't need as much heating and our extracurricular expenses were lower.

That comes from Daniel's full-time salary as a software developer and my part-time consulting work, along with some freelance writing projects I've been doing on the side. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our expenses and still set aside some money for savings and unexpected needs. I've learned that financial stability isn't about having more\u2014it's about having enough to feel secure and to be present for the people and causes that matter most. It's also been a reminder of how important it is to have a stable income, especially with the rising costs of living in Cambridge. I'm grateful for the work we both do, and I try to remind myself that every dollar we earn is a step toward building a better future for Sophie and for the community we're part of.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nDeborah Rogers: I've been working in my current consulting role for about four years now, though my career path has been a bit winding. What I appreciate most about my current work is the flexibility it offers. I'm contracted through a small firm that specializes in education equity, and they allow me to set my own hours as long as I meet my project deadlines. This has been incredibly important for me, especially as a mother. The benefits of the job include health insurance, which covers my hypertension medications and regular check-ups, and a generous paid time off policy that allows me to take days off when I need to recharge or be with Sophie. I also get a few weeks of vacation each year, which I try to use for family trips or to visit my parents in Massachusetts. One of the things I value most is the sense of purpose that comes with my work\u2014knowing that the policies I help shape can make a real difference in the lives of students and families, especially those from immigrant backgrounds. It's not always easy, but I feel lucky to have a job that aligns with my values and gives me the freedom to be present for the people I care about.\n\n",

I work with a small team of consultants, and we have a strong sense of mutual respect and shared purpose. My manager, Sarah, is someone I really admire\u2014she's not only knowledgeable about education policy but also deeply committed to the communities we serve. She's very supportive, and she encourages us to bring our whole selves to the work we do. I think that makes a big difference in how we approach our projects. As for my coworkers, we've built a good rapport over the years. We often have lunch meetings or coffee breaks where we talk not just about work, but also about our families, our passions, and even our challenges. It's rare to find a workplace where people are so invested in both the mission and each other, and I'm really grateful for that. It makes the long hours and the sometimes complex work feel more meaningful, knowing I'm part of a team that genuinely cares about making a difference.\n\n",

I typically set my own hours, as long as I meet project deadlines, so I can adjust my days based on Sophie's needs or my own energy levels. Some weeks are more structured, especially when I'm working on a specific policy analysis or preparing for a meeting with stakeholders, but other times I have more freedom to work from home or even take a few hours off in the afternoon if I need to run errands or spend time with family. That flexibility has been crucial for me, especially as a mother, because it allows me to be present for Sophie without sacrificing my career. I also try to block out time for deep work in the mornings when I'm most focused, and then use the afternoons for meetings or lighter tasks. It's not perfect, but it gives me a good balance between being productive and being there for the people I care about.\n\n",

I think the key for us has been prioritizing what truly matters\u2014our family, our health, and the causes we care about.

My mother had a bachelor's degree in literature and worked part-time as a translator and editor for a publishing house.

His most important activities involved problem-solving, ensuring that the systems he designed were not only functional but also safe and sustainable for the communities they served.

It was a very technical job, and he often spoke about the precision and responsibility that came with it. He made sure that every project he worked on was not only efficient but also safe for the people who would use it. My mother worked for a small publishing house that specialized in translating and editing academic and literary works. She was especially proud of the projects that involved preserving Lithuanian literature and making it accessible to a wider audience. Even though she worked part-time, she always treated her work with the same dedication as if it were full-time.

I hope Sophie grows into a thoughtful, curious, and kind young woman who feels empowered to make a difference in the world, just as I hope to continue supporting her in that journey.
