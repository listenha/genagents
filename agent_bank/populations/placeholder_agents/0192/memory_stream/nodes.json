    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nRachel Johnson: Well, I was born and raised in Chicago, right here in Illinois. My parents both grew up in the same neighborhood, and we've always lived in the same city since I was a kid. I remember growing up on Maple Avenue, just a few blocks from where I live now. My dad worked at a factory, and my mom was a nurse at a local clinic. They both only went through high school, but they always made sure I had everything I needed for school. I was a pretty quiet kid, always more interested in books than sports. I didn't have a lot of money growing up, but my family was pretty average, and we managed. I went to public school all through high school, and I graduated with a regular diploma. I didn't go to college because I wanted to start working right away. I've been working part-time at a bookstore ever since I turned 16, and I've been saving up for a car, but I still haven't been able to afford one. I'm Catholic, and I've been going to church every Sunday since I was a kid. I don't really think about politics too much, but I do know I'm a Democrat, and I believe in helping people who aren't as lucky as I am. I'm not married, and I don't really see myself getting married anytime soon. I just want to keep working, maybe save up a little more, and see where life takes me.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nRachel Johnson: Hmm, thinking about it, there was one moment that really shaped my path. When I was about 17, I had the chance to get a scholarship to a community college. My guidance counselor actually recommended it, saying I had the potential to do well if I just gave it a try. But my parents were worried about the cost, even with the scholarship, and I didn't want to put them through that stress. I remember sitting on the couch one night, staring at the application, and feeling like I was standing at the edge of something big. I knew if I went, I might have a better future, but I also knew I was responsible for helping out at home. In the end, I decided to take the job at the bookstore instead. It was a hard choice, but I figured I could always go back to school later. Looking back, I wonder what might have happened if I had taken that chance. Still, I don't regret it because I've learned a lot from working and being responsible. It taught me the value of hard work and patience, even if it didn't go the way I originally planned.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nRachel Johnson: I think it was a conscious choice, even if it felt like a compromise at the time. I remember weighing the options carefully, talking it over with my mom, and even asking my dad what he thought. He said something like, 'If you think it's the right thing for you, you should go for it, but don't forget about us.' I didn't want to leave them behind, so I chose the path that felt most responsible. I didn't just 'fall into' the bookstore job\u2014I applied for it, interviewed for it, and committed to it. I think that's what makes it a choice, even if it wasn't the one I wanted. It was the one I felt I could live with, and that's something I've had to learn to accept over time.\n\n",

My mom mentioned a few times that there were programs for young people who wanted to go to college but couldn't afford it, but I didn't really look into it. I guess I was too focused on the immediate stuff\u2014helping out at home, paying my own way, that kind of thing. Looking back, I wish I had asked more questions or reached out to someone who could have guided me better. Maybe if I had, I would have realized that there were ways to make it work without putting so much pressure on my parents. But I also know that I was pretty young, and I didn't have a lot of confidence in myself back then. I think if someone had believed in me more than I believed in myself, it might have made all the difference.\n\n",

He's 18 and just graduated from high school, so he's trying to figure out what he wants to do next. We're pretty close, even though we're both pretty quiet and not the most talkative people. My mom still works at the clinic, and my dad is still at the factory, though he's starting to think about retiring soon. They've been through a lot, but they've always been there for me. I see them every weekend, and we usually go to church together on Sundays. I love them both deeply, and I know I wouldn't be where I am today without their support. I guess I just hope that one day, I can do something to make their lives a little easier, even if I'm not sure exactly how yet.\n\n",

My grandma used to work as a teacher before she got married, and she always encouraged me to keep learning, even if I wasn't in school. I think that's where I got my love for books from. My grandpa was in the military, but he never talked about it much\u2014just said he did his duty. I respect him for that, even if I don't know much about his experiences. We don't talk about politics much with them, but they do support my views, especially when it comes to helping people.

One of them, Sarah, works at the same bookstore I do, and we've been friends for years. She's the one who always pushes me to think bigger, even if I don't always listen. She's the one who reminded me about the scholarship opportunity, actually. I guess I owe her a lot for that. Then there's Marcus, who was my best friend growing up. He moved out of the city a few years back to go to community college, and he's been working at a local hospital since he graduated. We talk a few times a month, and he always says I should consider going back to school someday. I don't know if I'll ever do it, but it's nice to have people in my life who believe in me, even when I don't believe in myself.

It's one of those places where everyone knows each other, and you can walk to the corner store or the park without worrying too much. There's a small community center nearby that hosts events like book clubs and job fairs, and I've been to a few of them. It's not the most exciting place in the world, but it feels like home. I like that it's safe, and there's a sense of community here that I don't think I'd find anywhere else. I've seen a lot of changes over the years\u2014some new businesses opening up, some old ones closing down\u2014but the heart of the neighborhood still feels the same. I think that's why I've never felt the need to move. It's not perfect, but it's familiar, and I know my way around.

It's not like the city is dangerous or anything, but there's a certain kind of peace that comes with knowing your neighbors and knowing that people look out for each other. I've never had any real issues with crime or anything like that. The only time I ever felt uneasy was a few years back when there was some talk about a new business opening up that brought in a lot of people from outside the neighborhood. Some folks were worried it would change things, but in the end, it just added a little more diversity to the area. I think the sense of safety comes from the fact that people here are pretty tight-knit. If something's wrong, someone will notice and help out. I don't know if I'd feel that same comfort in a bigger city or somewhere more anonymous. Here, I feel like I belong, and that makes all the difference.\n\n",

It's comforting to know where I fit in. But there are downsides too. Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle, you know? My parents are doing their best, but they're not getting any younger, and I know they worry about their future. I want to do better for them, but I also want to make sure I don't lose myself in the process.

After work, I usually grab a bite to eat\u2014sometimes at the little diner down the street, sometimes just a sandwich from the corner store.

I guess I'm learning that growth doesn't always come from big changes. Sometimes, it's just about showing up every day and trying a little harder than the day before.\n\n",

How about for you?\n\nRachel Johnson: I think I've been dealing with a lot of quiet anxiety, especially when things feel uncertain or when I'm overwhelmed with responsibilities. It's not the kind of anxiety that makes me panic or lose sleep, but more like a constant background worry that I'm not doing enough, not moving forward fast enough, or not being the kind of person my family deserves. I know that sounds selfish, but I've always felt like I have to be strong for them, even when I'm not sure how to be strong for myself.

My mom is still working at the clinic, though she's been talking about maybe slowing down a bit as she gets older. My dad is still at the factory, but he's been thinking about retiring soon, which is something we've been discussing as a family. He's been saving up for a few years now, and I think he's close to being ready. My brother, Michael, is the one who's been going through the most changes. He's just graduated from high school, and he's trying to figure out what he wants to do next. He's been applying to colleges and looking into scholarships, and I've been helping him with that as much as I can. It's strange, really, because I didn't go to college myself, but I want to make sure he has the opportunities I didn't. I think the hardest part for my parents has been watching me not take that path, but they've always been supportive. They know I've made my choices, and they respect that.

My family has always been Catholic, and going to church every Sunday was just something we did, like breathing or eating. It wasn't something I ever questioned growing up\u2014it was just part of who we were. But as I've gotten older, I've started thinking more about what it really means to me. I still believe in God, and I find comfort in the rituals, like the prayers and the sense of community during Mass. It's not that I'm deeply spiritual, but I do feel like there's something bigger than myself, something that connects us all. I know some people find faith to be a source of strength, and I think that's true for me too, even if I don't always feel it in the way others do. I guess I see it more as a foundation\u2014something that's always there, even when life feels uncertain.

But I have noticed that I've been trying to cope in different ways lately. I used to just push through everything, thinking that if I worked harder and stayed busy, the problems would go away. But now, I've started to realize that I need to take a step back sometimes and just breathe. I've been trying to practice mindfulness, even if it's just for a few minutes a day. I'll sit on the porch in the morning, watch the birds, and just let my thoughts flow without trying to control them. It doesn't always help, but it's something.

We live in a small apartment that my parents have owned for years, so the rent isn't too bad, but it still takes up a big chunk of our budget. Groceries are another thing\u2014my mom always shops carefully, but with my brother applying to colleges and needing to buy books and supplies, it's been a bit tight.

I still work part-time, and while it pays the bills, it doesn't leave much room for anything else. Sometimes I feel like we're just scraping by, but I know we're lucky compared to a lot of people. I've been trying to cut back on little things, like buying cheaper groceries or using public transportation instead of taking the bus, just to save a few dollars here and there.

That covers rent, groceries, utilities, and a few other small things like phone bills and the occasional outing with the family. It's not a lot, but it's enough to get by, especially since we're all used to living simply. The past month was a bit tighter because of my brother's college applications, but I think that's pretty normal for us. We've always been a family that knows how to stretch a dollar, and I guess that's one of the things I've learned from my parents.

It's not much to look at\u2014just a few rooms, a small kitchen, and a living room that doubles as a dining area\u2014but it's always felt like a safe place. The rent is manageable, especially since the landlord is someone my dad knows from work, and he's been pretty understanding over the years. I know it's not the most stable situation, but it's worked for us. I guess I've never really thought about what it would be like to own a home, but I know my parents have talked about it sometimes.

In the winter, heating costs go up, and that's always something we have to budget for. We usually try to keep the thermostat low to save money, but it's still a noticeable increase on the utility bill. Then there's the summer, when air conditioning kicks in, and that's another hit to the wallet. We also had a few unexpected expenses, like when my dad had to replace the car's alternator last spring\u2014it wasn't something we planned for, but it was necessary. And of course, there's the holidays. Christmas is always a bit of a strain, even if we keep it simple. We usually just have a small dinner with family and maybe exchange a few gifts, but even that adds up.

I think that's why I've stayed there for so long. It's not just about the money; it's about the connection I feel with the books and the people who come in.

My job at the bookstore pays about $12 an hour, and with the hours I work, that's where most of the money comes from. My parents don't earn a lot either\u2014my mom's salary at the clinic is just enough to cover her own needs, and my dad's factory job is steady but not high-paying. We all chip in where we can, and it's not always easy, but we make it work. I know it's not a lot, but I'm grateful for every dollar because it helps keep the lights on and the food on the table. I just hope that one day, I can do more than just keep things afloat\u2014I want to be able to give back, even if it's in small ways.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nRachel Johnson: I've been working at the bookstore for almost five years now, ever since I turned 16. It's been a long time, and I think I've grown a lot in that time, even if it's not in the way I originally imagined. The benefits of the job aren't the kind you usually hear about\u2014no health insurance, no paid vacation days, just a few days off here and there when the store is slow. But what I do get is a sense of purpose and a small amount of flexibility. Mr. Thompson, the owner, is pretty understanding, and if I need a day off for something important, like helping my brother with an application or just needing a break, he usually lets me take it. I know it's not much, but it's enough to keep me going. I also get to interact with people every day, which is something I really value. It's not just about the money\u2014it's about the connection I feel with the books, the customers, and the little moments that make the job feel meaningful, even if it's not perfect.\n\n",

Mr. Thompson, the owner, is like a second father to me\u2014he's always been supportive, even when I wasn't sure what I wanted out of life. He's the one who encouraged me to keep reading and learning, even when I wasn't sure why it mattered. I think he sees something in me that I didn't see in myself back then. As for my coworkers, we get along well. There's Sarah, who I mentioned before, and she's been my friend for years. We've been through a lot together, from long shifts to late-night conversations about books we've read. Then there's Marcus, who used to work here too before he went to college. We still keep in touch, and he always says I should consider going back to school someday. I guess the relationships here aren't complicated, but they're real. We all know each other's strengths and weaknesses, and we look out for one another. It's not the kind of job that pays well or offers a lot of perks, but it's a place where I feel like I belong, and that means more than I can say.\n\n",

I usually work Tuesday through Saturday, and I know exactly what to expect each week. That consistency is something I really appreciate because it gives me a sense of structure, which is important when I'm juggling work, family responsibilities, and helping my brother with his college stuff. That said, there are times when things get a little less predictable, especially in the summer or around holidays when we get more customers. Mr. Thompson is pretty flexible if I need to adjust my hours for something important, like if my brother has an interview or if my parents need help.

I know we're not struggling in the way that some people are, and I'm grateful for that. It's just that there's always this constant awareness of how much we're spending and how little we have left. I don't mind working hard or making sacrifices, but sometimes I wonder if there's more I could be doing to improve things. I know I could work more hours or take on another job, but I also know that I need to take care of my family and myself. I don't want to burn out or lose the little stability we have. I guess I'm just trying to find a balance between being responsible and not losing sight of who I am. I hope that one day, things will get a little easier, but for now, I'm just focused on doing what I can with what I have.\n\n",

It's not about having a lot\u2014it's about making sure we all have what we need, even if it's not much. I've been saving in small ways, like keeping a jar under my bed, and I know it's not the same as having a real savings account, but it's something. I also see how my job at the bookstore gives me more than just money\u2014it gives me a sense of purpose and a way to connect with people.

My mom worked at the clinic for over 20 years, and my dad was at the factory for almost as long. They both started working right after high school, just like a lot of people in our neighborhood. I remember seeing my mom get up early every morning to catch the bus to work, and my dad would leave before sunrise too. They never complained about the work, even when it was tough. I think they both saw their jobs as a way to provide for our family, and they never missed a day unless it was absolutely necessary. It wasn't much money, but they always made sure we had food on the table, a roof over our heads, and the basics we needed.

She was always the one who stayed late when someone needed help, and she had a way of making people feel seen and heard, even when they were in pain or upset. I remember watching her work, and I always admired how calm she was, even in the busiest moments. She had a gentle way of speaking to people, and she never treated anyone with less respect just because they were poor or didn't have insurance. My dad worked at the factory, assembling parts for machinery. His job was repetitive, but he took pride in doing it well. He always said that if you did your job right, no one else had to worry about it. I remember him coming home tired but always trying to make sure we had everything we needed. He never talked much about his work, but I could tell it was hard. Both of them worked long hours, and they never complained, even when things were tough.

The clinic was run by a nonprofit organization, and they didn't make a lot of money, but they provided essential care to people who couldn't afford it otherwise. My mom would often come home exhausted, but she always made sure to talk to me about her day, even if it was just for a few minutes.
