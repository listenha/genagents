  "agent_profile_summary": "Miguel Garcia, a 44-year-old business analyst from Charlotte, North Carolina, grew up in Savannah, where his parents emphasized education and community. A pivotal moment came when he chose to move to Charlotte after college, following his mother’s encouragement, which led to a career in tech and a life centered around his family—his wife Maria and their two children, Alex and Sofia. He balances his demanding job with homeschooling, a decision made to provide a structured education during the pandemic, and remains committed to maintaining a stable home environment. Miguel values the support of his extended family, particularly his parents, and finds strength in his Catholic faith. His life is shaped by the ongoing tension between professional ambition and family responsibilities, and he approaches challenges with a pragmatic, community-oriented mindset, always seeking balance and connection."
