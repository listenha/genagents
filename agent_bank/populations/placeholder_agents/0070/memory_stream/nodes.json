Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAngela Rossi: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, and grew up in a middle-class household. My parents, Giuseppe and Maria Rossi, were both immigrants from Italy. My dad didn't finish high school, but my mom got her graduate degree. She worked as a teacher, which is why our family always emphasized education. I remember the tight-knit community we lived in; it was a mix of Italian Americans and other ethnic groups. We attended St. Joseph's Catholic Church, but as I got older, I started questioning religious beliefs and eventually decided not to follow any organized religion.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAngela Rossi: One such moment came when I was deciding whether to go to college right after high school or take a gap year. Both options seemed important, but my mom encouraged me to explore my interests and figure out what I wanted to do. After much consideration, I took a gap year to travel and work part-time. It was a transformative experience. I visited various parts of the United States and even traveled to Europe. During this time, I realized how much I loved working with children and decided to pursue a degree in early childhood education. I returned home, enrolled in a local community college, and eventually transferred to a four-year university to complete my bachelor's degree. That decision set me on a path towards a career that I'm passionate about, and it taught me the value of exploring different paths before committing fully.\n\n",

I didn't have a specific plan, but I knew I wanted to do something meaningful with my life. The journey of self-discovery during that gap year was crucial, and it helped me realize my passion for working with kids. It wasn't a sudden epiphany, but rather a gradual realization over time. Now, looking back, I can see how that decision has shaped my current career and my worldview.\n\n",

Or, perhaps a local community center or non-profit organization that focuses on youth development might have offered resources or programs that could have accelerated my journey.

Over the past two years, I've faced periods of stress and fatigue, particularly when work demands became overwhelming. These experiences highlighted the importance of recognizing and addressing my mental health proactively. I've learned that small, consistent habits, such as taking breaks during the day, engaging in regular exercise, and seeking support from friends and professionals, can make a significant difference in managing stress levels. While I've had moments of feeling overwhelmed, I'm grateful for the support system that helps me navigate these challenges and continue to thrive in my career. This journey of self-care and balance is ongoing, and I'm committed to prioritizing my well-being to ensure I can continue making a positive impact on the lives of the children I work with.",

I've been more intentional about setting boundaries at work, like turning off notifications during certain hours to avoid constant interruptions. I also make sure to schedule time for self-care, whether it's a relaxing bath, a walk in the park, or catching up with a good book. Engaging in these activities has helped me stay grounded and manage the demands of my job more effectively.\n\n",

Rent for my apartment is around $1,200, which takes up a significant portion of my income. Groceries, utilities, and transportation add up, but I try to keep them under control by meal prepping and using public transit. I also allocate money for professional development, like attending workshops or buying educational materials for the classroom.

In the summer months, my energy bills increased due to air conditioning, which was necessary given the heat. During the winter, they went down as the weather was cooler. Holidays and special events didn't have a significant impact on my expenses, but I did notice an uptick in grocery costs around Christmas when I had to buy gifts and festive treats for the children.

    "content": "Completing this interview has been a journey of self-discovery, allowing me to reflect on my life's journey and the choices that have led me to where I am today. From my childhood in Hoboken to my decision to take a gap year, and ultimately choosing a career in early childhood education, each step has been a part of a larger narrative. The support and values instilled in me by my family, particularly my mom's emphasis on education and exploration, have been instrumental in shaping my path. The interview also highlighted the importance of having a strong support system, both within my family and among my colleagues, which has provided me with a sense of community and encouragement. Reflecting on my experiences, I realize that while the path has had its ups and downs, the commitment to self-care and balance is crucial for navigating the challenges of my career and personal life. Moving forward, I am grateful for the opportunities that have come my way and am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.",
