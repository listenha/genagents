  "agent_profile_summary": "Angela Rossi, 25, grew up in Hoboken, New Jersey, in a close-knit Italian American family that valued education and community. After high school, she chose to take a gap year to travel and work, a decision that led her to discover her passion for working with children and ultimately to pursue a degree in early childhood education. Now, she works part-time as an educator in a daycare center, where she finds fulfillment in nurturing young minds and fostering their growth. Her life is shaped by a balance between her career and a commitment to self-care, mental health, and maintaining a supportive network of friends and colleagues. Though she faces financial challenges, she remains focused on her long-term goal of advancing in her field, driven by the same values of exploration and purpose that guided her from the start. Her thoughtful approach to life, rooted in experience and reflection, informs how she connects with others and navigates both personal and professional challenges."
