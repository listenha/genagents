  "agent_profile_summary": "Ryan Otoole, a 22-year-old Portland native, grew up in a modest household where his mother’s dedication to education and his father’s steady work ethic shaped his early values. After a year working at a local bookstore, he made the conscious decision to return to school, choosing community college over continuing in a routine job, a turning point that reflected his desire for growth over comfort. Now, he balances part-time work at the library with classes and a commitment to exploring his academic interests, often reflecting on how small, meaningful interactions—like those with his sister, his coworkers, or even a regular customer at the bookstore—have influenced his path. His life is marked by a quiet determination to find purpose, even as he navigates the tension between uncertainty and the need for stability, always seeking a balance between self-care and progress."
