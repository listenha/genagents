Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nDevon Johnson: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in New York City and grew up in East Chicago, Indiana, which is part of the East North Central region. My parents, both from Jamaica, moved there when they met in college. They were both working-class folks; my dad had just a high school diploma and worked as a factory worker, while my mom didn't finish high school but managed to find work in a local diner. Despite not having much money, they did their best to give us a good upbringing. I lived with them until I was 18, after which I moved to Chicago to pursue higher education.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nDevon Johnson: One significant moment was when I decided to join the military right after college. It was a tough decision, given that I had always been more interested in academics and social justice work. However, the promise of stability and a path to better job opportunities was too tempting to ignore. I served for over five years, which gave me discipline and a sense of purpose. After my service, I returned to Chicago and found a part-time job while pursuing my graduate degree in public policy. It was a challenging but rewarding experience.\n\n",

There were moments when I felt like the decision to join the military was something that just happened, but looking back, I can see how it was influenced by my circumstances and the expectations placed upon me. My parents always wanted us to do well, and they believed in the value of service. Plus, during that time, jobs in the public sector were hard to come by, and the military offered a clear path forward. But even though it wasn't entirely my own idea, I found a sense of purpose and discipline that I carried with me into my studies and career.\n\n",

The support of my family, particularly my parents, has been instrumental throughout my life, offering encouragement and a foundation of values that guide my decisions.

My rent is my biggest expense, followed closely by groceries and transportation. I try to save a little each month, but the part-time job doesn't always leave a lot left over. I've been thinking about ways to increase my income, maybe by taking on more freelance projects or finding a full-time position, but those options can be tough to come by.

    "content": "Completing this interview has been both challenging and fulfilling. Reflecting on my life journey from childhood to my current career, I realize how much my experiences have shaped who I am today. Growing up in a working-class household with immigrant parents instilled in me a strong work ethic and the importance of education, which has guided my decisions and led me to pursue a career in public policy and community work. The support of my family, especially my parents, has been instrumental throughout my life, offering encouragement and a foundation of values that continue to guide my choices. The challenges I've faced, such as balancing work and personal life, managing stress, and navigating the financial realities of part-time employment, have all contributed to my resilience and determination. While the road has been bumpy, the sense of community and the opportunity to make a positive impact on people's lives keeps me motivated and inspired. Through this interview, I've gained a deeper understanding of my life's narrative and the importance of maintaining a balanced approach to my work, personal life, and community engagement.",
