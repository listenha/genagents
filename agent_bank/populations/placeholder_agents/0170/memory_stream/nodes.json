    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nLeticia Daniels: I was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina, in a tight-knit neighborhood where everyone knew each other. My parents were both hardworking, and though they didn't have a lot of money, they always made sure my brother and I had everything we needed. My father was a teacher with a bachelor's degree, and my mother had an associate's degree but chose to stay home for a while when I was young. I grew up in a Christian household, though I haven't been religious for quite some time now. I always had a good education, and I was the first in my family to go to college. I studied business, which I thought would be a stable path, but after graduation, I found myself taking a different route. I got married young, but the marriage didn't last, and I ended up raising my son alone. I've been a full-time homemaker for the past few years, but I still keep my mind sharp by reading and learning new things. Life hasn't always gone the way I expected, but I've learned to adapt and find joy in the little things.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nLeticia Daniels: Yes, there was definitely a crossroads. After I graduated with my bachelor's in business, I had a job offer from a local company, but I also met someone and got pregnant shortly after. I was young and scared, and I chose to put my career on hold to raise my son. Looking back, I think I was trying to prove something to myself\u2014that I could be a good mother and still have a stable life. But over time, I realized that I missed the challenge of work, the sense of purpose it gave me. I tried going back to school a few years later, but it was hard to balance everything. Eventually, I decided to focus on being a homemaker and raising my son the best I could. I don't regret my choices, but I do wonder what my life would have been like if I had taken that job and pursued my career first. It's funny how life has a way of redirecting you, sometimes in ways you don't expect.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nLeticia Daniels: I think it was a mix of both, honestly. I made the choice to step away from my career, but life had a way of making it feel like it 'just happened' at times. I was so focused on being there for my son, on giving him the love and stability I thought he needed, that I didn't always see the other paths clearly. I remember sitting at my desk one day, looking at the job offer in front of me, and realizing I was more scared of failing as a mother than I was of failing in my career. It wasn't a single moment, but a series of small decisions that added up. I don't think I would have made the same choice if I were older or more confident in myself. But I also know that I made the best decision I could with the information and emotions I had at the time. Life has a way of teaching you lessons, even when you don't see them coming.\n\n",

At the time, I didn't really know where to turn. I was young, and I didn't have a strong support network outside of my family. My parents were supportive, but they had their own lives and challenges. I wish I had reached out to a counselor or a mentor who could have helped me navigate those decisions with more clarity. There were organizations in the community that offered support for young mothers, but I didn't know about them. Looking back, I think if I had access to more information or guidance, I might have felt more confident in making a choice that balanced both my career and my role as a mother. It's something I've come to appreciate more now, especially as my son gets older and I see how important it is to have support systems in place.\n\n",

He's 12 years old, and he's a bright, curious kid with a passion for science. We live in the same house I grew up in, and it feels like home. I don't have a partner at the moment, but I've never been one to rush into relationships. I want to make sure I'm emotionally and mentally ready to give someone else the kind of love and attention my son deserves. My parents are still around, and though they live a few towns over, we stay in touch regularly. My mother, in particular, has been a big support to me over the years. She's the one who encouraged me to go back to school a few years ago, even though I didn't end up finishing. I also have a few close friends from high school who I still keep in touch with\u2014though life has taken us in different directions, we always make time for each other. Family and friends are the foundation of my life, and I'm grateful for them every day.\n\n",

It was also interesting to reflect on the crossroads I faced and how, at the time, I thought I was making the best choice for my son and myself. Looking back, I realize how much support I could have used, and how much I've grown from the experiences I had. Now, with my son growing up and my own life continuing to unfold, I feel more confident in who I am and the path I've chosen.

Who are they, and what is your relationship with them like?\n\nLeticia Daniels: My brother, Marcus, is someone I haven't mentioned yet. He's a few years older than me, and we've always had a strong bond. He's a nurse in a nearby hospital, and he's been my rock through a lot of the challenges I've faced over the years. We don't see each other as often as I'd like, but whenever we do, it's like no time has passed. He's the one who helped me get back on my feet after my divorce, even lending me money when I needed it most. We have our differences, of course\u2014like most siblings\u2014but I know I can always count on him. He's the kind of person who puts others first, and I admire that about him. I also have a cousin, Tiffany, who's like a sister to me. She's a teacher in the same school district as my son, and she's been a great influence on him. She's helped me feel more connected to the community and has even offered to help me with some of the things I've been thinking about\u2014like maybe going back to school again someday.

One of them is Sarah, who I met in college. We were roommates, and even though we went different ways after graduation, we've stayed close. She's a social worker now, and she's always been the one to remind me that it's okay to ask for help. She's the kind of person who listens without judgment and has been there for me through some really tough times. Then there's Jamal, who I met through a community center program when I was trying to get back on my feet after my divorce. He's a graphic designer, and he's helped me with some of the creative projects I've taken on in my free time\u2014like designing a small online store for handmade crafts I started making. He's also the one who introduced me to a local support group for single mothers, which has been a huge help. These people, even though they're not family, have been like family to me. They've helped me feel less alone and reminded me that I'm not the only one navigating life's challenges.\n\n",

It's a mix of older homes and newer developments, and there's a real sense of community here. The street is lined with oak trees, and in the spring, the blossoms are beautiful. Most of my neighbors are families with kids, which makes it feel like a safe and welcoming place for my son. There's a small park nearby where he plays with other kids, and I often see the same faces there\u2014parents chatting while their children run around. I've been here for almost a decade now, and it's become my home in every sense of the word. I love the pace of life here\u2014it's not too fast, not too slow. It gives me time to reflect, to be present with my son, and to enjoy the little things like the smell of fresh-baked bread from the bakery down the street or the sound of birds in the morning.

The park is always busy with kids and parents, and I've never felt uncomfortable leaving my son to play while I run errands.

I know the neighbors, I know the rhythm of the street, and I know that my son is growing up in a place that feels safe and nurturing. But there are downs too. Sometimes, I feel like I'm stuck in a routine, and it's hard to break out of it.

Most mornings start with my son getting up, and we have a routine\u2014breakfast, a quick walk around the block, and then he heads off to school. I usually spend the morning catching up on things around the house\u2014cooking, cleaning, maybe doing some laundry or organizing. I also try to set aside some time for myself, whether it's reading a book, working on a craft project, or just sitting in the backyard with a cup of coffee and watching the birds.

He's in sixth grade now, and his school day runs from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. After school, he usually has a snack and then heads to his after-school activities. He's in a robotics club twice a week, which he absolutely loves. It's at the community center, and he's been working on building a small robot with some of his friends. On the other days, he either goes to the library or does homework with me. I try to make sure he has time to unwind, so we often have a family dinner together, and then he'll either watch a show or read a book before bed.

I still try to stay as healthy as I can\u2014eating well, getting enough sleep, and making time for exercise, even if it's just a short walk or some yoga in the morning. I do have some chronic issues with my back, probably from years of sitting at a desk during my college days and then lifting things around the house as a homemaker. I see a chiropractor every few months, and I take some over-the-counter pain relievers when needed. I also try to stay on top of my mental health, which has been a learning process for me. There were times when I felt overwhelmed or isolated, especially in the early years of raising my son alone, but I've learned to prioritize self-care now. I've started journaling more, and I've even joined a local meditation group that meets once a week. It's helped me feel more centered and grounded.

It's also the support from my son and friends who remind me to take breaks and not push myself too hard. What makes it hard, though, is the constant juggling act. There are days when I feel like I'm stretched thin, and I forget to prioritize my own needs. I used to think that taking care of myself was selfish, but I've learned that it's not\u2014it's necessary.

It reminded me how important it is to be careful with my body, especially since I'm not as young as I used to be. I also had a minor case of pneumonia last winter, which was a bit of a wake-up call. I hadn't been getting enough rest, and I think that contributed to it. It was tough being sick while also taking care of my son, but it taught me to listen to my body more closely. Since then, I've been more consistent with my chiropractic visits and even started seeing a physical therapist to strengthen my core.

It was a wake-up call for me\u2014realizing that if I don't take care of myself, I can't take care of him the way I want to.

I've been trying to be more present in my son's life, and I think that's made a big difference for both of us. I've also been more open about my own feelings, which has helped me connect with people in a deeper way. There were moments when I felt overwhelmed, especially with the back pain and the pneumonia, but those challenges taught me to slow down and really listen to what my body and my heart are telling me. I've started journaling more consistently, and it's been a great way to process my thoughts and emotions. I also feel like I'm finally starting to see the value in taking time for myself, even if it's just a few minutes of quiet reflection each day.

It's amazing how something as simple as planting herbs and tomatoes can bring so much joy and learning into our daily lives. At the same time, reflecting on my health reminded me of the importance of taking care of myself, not just for my own well-being but also for my son's. I used to think that prioritizing my health was selfish, but now I see it as essential. It's not about being perfect\u2014it's about being present, listening to my body, and making small, intentional choices that support both my physical and mental health.

How about for you?\n\nLeticia Daniels: I've had my moments of feeling really low, especially in the early years after my divorce and when I was raising my son alone. There were times when I felt like I was carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders, and I didn't know how to ask for help. I think I used to confuse sadness with weakness, and I didn't want anyone to see me as broken or incapable. But over the past few years, I've come to understand that it's okay to feel vulnerable, to feel anxious, or even to feel like I'm not enough. I've started talking more openly about these feelings with my friends, especially Sarah, who has been a huge support. I've also started seeing a therapist, which has been really helpful in learning how to manage my thoughts and emotions. I don't think I would have reached out before, but I've learned that asking for help isn't a sign of failure\u2014it's a sign of strength. I still have days when I feel overwhelmed, but I'm learning to be kinder to myself and to recognize when I need to pause, breathe, and take care of my mental health.

My parents were both active in church, and I remember going to Sunday school and feeling a real sense of community there. But over time, as I got older and started thinking more critically about the world, I found myself questioning a lot of the things I was taught. I wasn't necessarily angry or disillusioned, but I just didn't feel like the faith I was raised with fit the way I saw life anymore. Now, I don't identify with any particular religion, but I do think spirituality\u2014whether it's in nature, in the connections we have with others, or in the quiet moments of reflection\u2014plays an important role in my life. I find peace in the little things, like watching the sunrise or listening to my son laugh, and I think that's its own kind of faith.

That said, I do have a Facebook account where I stay in touch with family and some old friends. I like seeing photos of my parents, my brother, and even some of my cousins who live out of state.

For me, the support has always come from the people I know in real life\u2014my family, my friends, and even my neighbors. When I was going through some tough times after my divorce, it was my brother who helped me get back on my feet, and my friend Sarah who reminded me that it was okay to feel lost sometimes. I think social media can be a double-edged sword. It can connect you with people who understand what you're going through, but it can also make you feel more isolated if you're comparing your life to others'. I've always preferred face-to-face conversations or even a phone call when I need support. There's something about hearing someone's voice or seeing their face that makes it feel more real and comforting. That said, I can see how it might be useful for someone who doesn't have a strong support system in their immediate life.

I used to worry that I wasn't living up to some invisible standard of success or productivity, but now I see that my life has its own kind of richness. I've also developed some new coping strategies, like journaling more consistently and taking short walks in the morning to clear my mind. I've even started meditating a few times a week, which has helped me feel more centered, especially when things get overwhelming.

The bulk of that goes to groceries, which is always a big one\u2014especially with my son's school meals and snacks.

As a homemaker, my duties include managing the household, caring for my son, and ensuring that our home is a place of comfort and stability. I also run a small online store where I sell handmade soaps, candles, and bath bombs.

    "content": "Interviewer: In total, how much did your household make in the past month?\n\nLeticia Daniels: In total, our household made around $1,800 in the past month, mostly from my online store and a small part-time gig I took on at the local library helping with inventory. It's not a lot, but it's enough to cover our basic needs and some of the things we enjoy, like our weekly trips to the park or the occasional family dinner out. I've learned to be really careful with every dollar, and I try to stretch things as much as I can. It's not always easy, but I've come to appreciate the value of what we have and the life we've built together. I also have a small side income from selling some of the herbs and vegetables we grow in our garden, which helps a little too. It's not about making a fortune, but about making sure we're taken care of and that my son has the opportunities he deserves.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nLeticia Daniels: I don't have a traditional workplace in the way most people do, but if I had to describe it, I'd say my workplace is my home, my online store, and the community center where I volunteer. I've been running my online store for about five years now, and while it's not a 9-to-5 job, it has its own kind of structure and rhythm. The benefits of this kind of work are different from what you might find in a corporate job. For one, I have the flexibility to set my own hours, which is something I really value, especially as a mother. I can work when my son is occupied, and I can take breaks when I need to. That said, there are no health benefits or paid time off in the traditional sense, which is something I've had to be mindful of. I've had to build my own safety net through savings and a strong support system. I also don't get sick days or vacation time, so I have to plan my rest and recovery carefully. But I think the biggest benefit is the sense of purpose and control I have over my work. I get to create something with my own hands, connect with people who appreciate what I make, and contribute to my community in ways that matter to me. It's not perfect, but it's mine, and I'm learning to be grateful for that.\n\n",

With my online store, I interact with customers who leave reviews, ask questions, and sometimes even share their own stories about how they use my products. It's a different kind of relationship, but it feels meaningful because it's built on trust and connection. When I volunteer at the community center, I work with other volunteers and staff who are all passionate about helping kids. We don't have a formal hierarchy, but there's a real sense of teamwork and mutual support. I think the relationships I've built are more personal and authentic than what I've seen in traditional workplaces. I don't have a boss who tells me what to do, but I do have people who encourage me, challenge me, and remind me why I started this journey in the first place. That kind of support, even if it's not structured like a corporate job, is something I'm really grateful for.\n\n",

Unlike a traditional job with set hours, I can work when it fits best with my son's schedule and my own energy levels. Most days, I focus on my online store in the afternoons or evenings, especially when he's doing homework or involved in activities. On other days, I might spend more time volunteering at the community center or tending to the garden. That said, there are times when things get busier\u2014like when I'm preparing for a new product launch or helping with a big event at the center\u2014and those days can feel a bit less predictable. But overall, I like the freedom to shape my days around what matters most. It's not always easy to balance everything, but I've learned to go with the flow and make the most of the time I have.\n\n",

I know we don't have a lot, but we have what we need, and sometimes more than that. I've learned to be really mindful of every dollar, and I take pride in knowing that I'm providing for my son in the best way I can. It's not about having the biggest house or the fanciest things\u2014it's about stability, security, and being able to say yes to the things that matter most, like a family dinner, a weekend trip to the park, or even just a quiet evening with a book. I've also come to appreciate the little ways I can stretch our budget, like growing our own food or making our own cleaning supplies. It's not always easy, and there are days when I feel the weight of it all, but I've learned that financial security isn't just about numbers\u2014it's about peace of mind, knowing that I'm doing the best I can for my son and for myself.

My dad was a teacher, and he worked full-time at a local high school for over 20 years. He always made sure to be there for us, even if it meant staying late after school or coming home late on some nights. My mom, on the other hand, had an associate's degree and worked part-time for a while, but she eventually chose to stay home with me and my brother for a few years. She worked as a receptionist at a small office, but she left that job when I was around six to focus on our family. Looking back, I think my parents both made sacrifices to give me and my brother a good life. They didn't have a lot of money, but they always made sure we had everything we needed\u2014school supplies, books, and even the occasional treat. I remember my dad bringing home extra work sometimes, and my mom would stay up late to help him grade papers or prepare lessons. It wasn't easy, but they never made us feel like we were missing out. I think that's one of the reasons I always wanted to do well in school and make something of myself. I wanted to make sure I never had to worry about things like that, and I wanted to give my son the same kind of stability and support that my parents gave me.\n\n",

He had a real passion for education, and he always made sure his students felt seen and supported. I remember him staying after school to help kids who were struggling, and he even started a tutoring program for students who needed extra help. He was strict when he needed to be, but he had a way of making you feel like he believed in you, even when you didn't believe in yourself. My mom, on the other hand, worked as a receptionist at a small office, and her duties were more about managing phone calls, scheduling appointments, and keeping the office running smoothly. She was very organized and had a great sense of humor, which made the office a more pleasant place to be. Even though she left her job to stay home with us for a while, she always said she was proud of the work she did, and I think that's why I learned to value hard work so much. Both of them had different kinds of jobs, but they both gave their all, and that's something I carry with me every day.\n\n",

It was a pretty traditional school setting, with a lot of students from the neighborhood we lived in. He was known for being fair but also very passionate about his subjects. He would often bring real-world examples into his lessons, making history and literature feel relevant and exciting. My mom worked for a small local law firm as a receptionist. It wasn't a big company, but it was a family-owned business, and she was one of the first people they hired. She was the one who greeted clients, scheduled appointments, and handled all the day-to-day office tasks. I remember her telling me that she loved the people she worked with and the sense of community in that office. Even though their jobs were different, both of them had a strong work ethic and always made sure they gave their best, even on the hardest days. I think that's one of the reasons I grew up valuing hard work and dedication so much\u2014it was something they both embodied in their own ways.\n\n",

I also hope that I'm still learning, still growing, and still finding joy in the little things\u2014like the way the sun hits the garden in the morning or the sound of his laughter when he's excited about something new.

I hope I'm still surrounded by the people I love, and that I'm still able to be present for my son, for my family, and for the life we've built together.
