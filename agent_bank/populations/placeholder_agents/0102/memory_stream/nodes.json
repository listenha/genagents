Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAngela Mason: I was born in a small town in the Midwest, where life moved at a slower pace, and everyone knew each other. My parents were both high school graduates, and while they worked hard to make ends meet, we never had a lot of money. I remember growing up in a modest home on Elmwood Avenue in Ann Arbor, though I actually moved there later in my teens. I was raised in a Protestant household, but as I got older, I found myself drawn to Buddhism, which felt more in line with my values of mindfulness and compassion. I married young, and while my husband and I have faced our share of challenges, we've built a life together that's full of love and resilience. I served in the military for over four years, which was a defining experience for me\u2014it taught me discipline, responsibility, and the importance of community. I earned my bachelor's degree while balancing work and family, and though I'm not wealthy, I feel grateful for the life I've built and the opportunities I've had.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAngela Mason: Yes, there was a moment that felt like a crossroads, and it happened right after I turned 18. I had just graduated high school and was trying to figure out what to do next. My parents wanted me to go to community college and start working part-time to help support the family, but I had a different vision. I had always been drawn to the idea of serving others, and I felt a strong pull toward the military. I remember sitting with my parents one evening, telling them I wanted to enlist. They were worried\u2014my father had served in the military during the Vietnam War and had seen a lot, and he didn't want me to go through that. But I felt like this was my path. I ended up joining the Army, and it was one of the most challenging yet transformative decisions I ever made. It changed the course of my life in ways I couldn't have predicted. It gave me discipline, purpose, and a sense of belonging that I had never felt before. It also opened doors for education and opportunities I never thought I'd have. Looking back, I know that moment was pivotal\u2014it shaped who I am today, both as a person and as a partner, mother, and community member.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nAngela Mason: I think it was a conscious choice, even if it felt like it was pulling me from somewhere deep inside. I remember lying awake at night, thinking about what I wanted my life to be. I didn't want to just settle into a routine of working a minimum-wage job and never really growing beyond that. I wanted to challenge myself, to see the world, to be part of something bigger. When I told my parents, I wasn't just making a decision\u2014I was stepping into a future that felt uncertain but full of promise. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I also knew that if I didn't take that step, I might always wonder what could have been. So I chose to enlist, and I've never regretted it.\n\n",

In fact, I remember reaching out to a guidance counselor at my high school who had a background in military service. She was the one who first suggested that the military could be a path not just for service, but also for education and personal growth. She took the time to sit down with me, explain the options, and even helped me connect with someone who had recently returned from deployment. That conversation gave me the courage to talk to my parents and take the next step. I also think the support from my community, especially my church, played a role. They didn't fully understand the military life, but they offered prayers and encouragement, which meant a lot to me during that time. I believe that having someone who believed in me, even just a little, made all the difference.\n\n",

My husband, David, and I got married right after I came back from my second deployment. We met through a mutual friend who was also in the military, and we bonded over our shared experiences and the challenges of transitioning back to civilian life. We have a daughter, Lily, who's six, and a son, Ethan, who's three. Raising them has been both rewarding and challenging, especially since I've had to balance my job, my family, and my ongoing education. David works as a mechanic, and while he doesn't make a lot, he's always been supportive of my goals. I'm currently working part-time at a local community center, where I help organize programs for veterans and their families. It's a small way to give back, and I feel like it ties back to the purpose I found in the military. My children are growing up in a home that values kindness, resilience, and the importance of service, and I hope they carry those values with them as they grow.\n\n",

It was meaningful to think about how each of those experiences contributed to my sense of self and purpose. I realized how much I've grown from the person I was as a teenager to the mother, partner, and community member I am now.

Who are they, and what is your relationship with them like?\n\nAngela Mason: My immediate family includes my parents, both of whom I'm very close to, even though we don't see each other as often as I'd like. My father, Thomas, is a quiet man who worked as a factory worker for most of his life. He never had the chance to go to college, but he always encouraged me to pursue education and make the most of my opportunities. My mother, Margaret, worked part-time at a local library and was always the heart of our home. She passed away a few years ago, but her influence on me is still strong. She was the one who first taught me to read, and she always believed in the power of kindness. My parents divorced when I was in high school, which was a difficult time for me, but they both remained supportive of my decisions, even when they didn't fully understand them. I still talk to my father regularly, and though our conversations are often brief, I know he's proud of the life I've built. I also have an older sister, Sarah, who lives in Ohio. We're not as close as I'd like, but we keep in touch through phone calls and occasional visits. She's a nurse, and I admire her for the compassion and dedication she brings to her work. I think my family, in their own ways, have all played a role in shaping who I am today.\n\n",

Are there people outside of your family who are important to you?\n\nAngela Mason: Yes, there are a few friends and mentors who have been important to me along the way. One person who comes to mind is Lisa, a fellow soldier I met during my time in the Army. We became close during deployment, and she was like a sister to me. She had a way of making even the toughest days feel bearable. After I came back, we stayed in touch, and she actually helped me navigate the transition back to civilian life. She encouraged me to go back to school and even helped me apply for scholarships. I lost touch with her for a while after I had my kids, but we reconnected a few years ago, and I'm grateful for that. She's someone who believed in me when I wasn't sure I believed in myself. Then there's my friend Marcus, who works at the community center where I volunteer. He's a veteran too, and we often talk about the challenges of readjusting to life after service. He's been a great support system for me, and I think I've learned just as much from him as he has from me.

It's a mix of older homes and newer developments, and there's a real sense of community here. The streets are lined with trees, and there are a lot of families with kids like mine living nearby. I really appreciate the walkability\u2014there are parks, libraries, and even a few small businesses that make the area feel alive. The community center where I work is just a short walk from my house, which is convenient, especially with two young kids to take care of. I also enjoy the local coffee shop down the street; it's a cozy place where I can grab a cup of coffee and catch up with friends or even meet other parents. While it's not the same as the small town I grew up in, there's something comforting about being in a place where people know each other and look out for one another. It feels like a good balance between the familiarity of home and the opportunities that come with being in a bigger city.\n\n",

There's a lot of foot traffic in the neighborhood, especially around the parks and the community center, and I've never felt threatened or unsafe. That said, I know safety can be subjective. I've had moments where I've been more cautious, like when I'm walking alone at night, but overall, I feel like this is a place where people look out for each other. I think it helps that the community is tight-knit, and there's a sense of shared responsibility. I've even seen neighbors help each other out during emergencies or when someone is in need.

On the positive side, the sense of community is something I really appreciate. There are always people around to help out, whether it's a neighbor offering to watch the kids while I run errands or someone stopping by to check in if I've had a tough day. The schools are good, and my kids have made friends with other kids in the neighborhood, which is important for their development. I also love that Ann Arbor has a lot of cultural and educational opportunities\u2014there are museums, theaters, and even university events that my family can enjoy. But there are downsides too. The cost of living here is higher than I expected, and even with my job and my husband's income, it's sometimes tight. We've had to make sacrifices, like downsizing our car or cutting back on things like dining out. Also, being in a city with a lot of diversity can be both enriching and challenging.

We often go to the park, visit the library, or have a family day out at a museum or a local festival.

The center is a hub for a lot of different programs\u2014some for veterans, some for families, and others focused on education and wellness.

It's not a high-paying job, but it's meaningful. I get to give back to the community in a way that feels aligned with my values, and I also get to connect with people who have had similar experiences, like other veterans or those who are navigating life transitions. I've even started a small group for parents who are military spouses or veterans themselves, and it's been a great way to build a sense of camaraderie. While I'm not working full-time, I've also been taking online courses to work toward a master's degree in social work. It's a slow process, but I'm committed to it.

I try to set aside at least 15 minutes each morning before the kids are up to sit in silence and focus on my breath.

When I was in the military, I was pretty active\u2014training, physical fitness tests, and long hours on duty kept me in shape. But after I came back, things changed.

It wasn't something I thought much about at the time, but over the years, it's come back occasionally, especially when I'm lifting heavy objects or spending long hours on my feet at the community center.

How about you?\n\nAngela Mason: The back pain has definitely had an impact on my daily life, especially when I'm working at the community center for long hours or helping with events that require lifting or standing for extended periods. There were a few weeks when I had to take it easy and adjust my schedule, which was tough because I didn't want to let my responsibilities slip. I had to learn how to listen to my body and not push through the pain just to keep going. It also affected my ability to be as present with my kids as I wanted to be\u2014some days, I was more tired or sore than I wanted to admit. But honestly, it became a turning point for me. It forced me to slow down and prioritize my health in a way I hadn't before. I started using a foam roller, I made sure to take breaks during the day, and I even started incorporating more stretching into my morning routine. It wasn't just about managing the pain\u2014it was about learning how to take care of myself in a more sustainable way. I think it's made me a better parent, a better worker, and a better person overall. I've come to see my health not as something separate from my life, but as the foundation of everything I do.\n\n",

Raising two kids, working part-time, going to school, and taking care of my health\u2014it's a lot to juggle. But I've also felt a deep sense of purpose, especially when I see the impact I'm having at the community center. There was a moment last spring when I was organizing a veterans' support event, and I saw one of the participants, a man who had struggled with PTSD, come up to me and say how much it meant to him to be part of that community. That moment reminded me why I do what I do. It also reminded me of how far I've come since my time in the military. I used to feel like I was just surviving, but now I feel like I'm truly living. Of course, there are still days when I feel like I'm not doing enough, or that I'm falling short of my own expectations.

I used to think that being busy meant being productive, but now I see that taking care of my health, both physically and mentally, is just as important as everything else. It's also been humbling to realize how much my body has been through, especially with the back pain from my time in the military.

How about for you?\n\nAngela Mason: I think I've struggled with anxiety at times, especially during the transition from military life to civilian life. There were moments when I felt disconnected from the world around me, like I didn't quite belong anywhere. The noise, the pace, the constant change\u2014it was overwhelming. I remember feeling anxious about my future, about whether I was making the right choices for my family. I didn't always know how to talk about it, so I often kept it inside. But over time, through meditation, therapy, and the support of friends and family, I've learned to recognize when I'm feeling anxious and how to manage it. I still have days when the weight of it all feels heavy, but I've come to see anxiety not as something to fear, but as a signal that I need to slow down, breathe, and take care of myself. I've also found comfort in my Buddhist practice, which teaches that suffering is a part of life, but so is peace.

There have been days when I feel like I'm not doing enough for anyone, but I've also seen how much my family has leaned on each other.

How about you?\n\nAngela Mason: For me, religion and spirituality have been a source of strength and grounding throughout my life. While I was raised in a Protestant household, I never felt a deep connection to that faith. It wasn't until I was in the military that I started exploring other spiritual paths, and Buddhism resonated with me in a way that felt authentic. The emphasis on mindfulness, compassion, and the acceptance of suffering as a natural part of life spoke to my experiences\u2014especially during the challenges of military service and the transition back to civilian life. Now, my Buddhist practice is an integral part of my daily routine. It helps me stay centered, especially when life feels overwhelming. I attend weekly meditation sessions at the local Buddhist center, and I try to incorporate mindfulness into everything I do, from how I parent my children to how I approach my work. Spirituality isn't about perfection for me\u2014it's about being present, being kind, and finding peace in the midst of chaos.

Tell me all about how you use these types of platforms.\n\nAngela Mason: I don't use social media very often, to be honest. I find that when I'm on platforms like Facebook or Instagram, it can sometimes feel more like a distraction than a connection. I follow a few pages related to Buddhism and mindfulness, and I occasionally look in on old friends or family members, but I don't spend a lot of time scrolling through feeds or comparing my life to others. I think part of that is because I've always been more of a private person, and I value face-to-face interactions over virtual ones. Plus, with two young kids, my time is pretty limited, and I prefer to use my phone for things like communication with my husband, keeping track of school events, or even just listening to music while I meditate. That said, I do appreciate the way social media can bring people together, especially for causes or communities that matter. I've been part of a few online groups for military spouses and veterans, and those have been helpful in connecting with others who understand what it's like to navigate life after service. It's just not the main way I stay connected\u2014it's more about the real, in-person relationships that I've built over the years.\n\n",

I used to rely on pushing through the stress, thinking that if I just worked harder or stayed busy, I could keep everything together.

Rent is the largest chunk of our budget\u2014since we live in Ann Arbor, the cost of housing is pretty high, and even though we're in a modest home, it still takes up about a third of our income. Groceries are another big one, especially with two kids. I try to buy in bulk and plan meals ahead of time to save money, but it's still a significant expense. My car payment is also a fixed cost, and while we only have one car, it's necessary for getting to work, school, and running errands. We also have some smaller recurring expenses like utilities, internet, and childcare for Ethan when I'm at the community center. I've been trying to be more mindful of our spending, and we've cut back on things like dining out and non-essential shopping.

That's actually pretty close to our usual monthly spending, though it can vary a bit. Rent is definitely the biggest single expense, taking up about $1,200 of that.

We've had to make some tough choices, like not going on vacation or skipping things like new clothes or dining out.

Renting has been the practical choice for us, especially with the way our financial situation has been over the years.

In the winter, our heating bill goes up quite a bit, and that's something we've had to budget for carefully. We also had a higher utility bill last month because of some unexpected repairs to the building's plumbing system, which affected all the tenants. That was a bit of a strain, but we managed by adjusting our spending elsewhere. During the holidays, we usually spend a little more on groceries and small gifts for the kids, but we try to keep it simple and meaningful rather than extravagant. When school starts in the fall, we also have to factor in things like back-to-school supplies, uniforms, and extracurricular fees for Lily's soccer and art classes. On the flip side, summer tends to be a bit easier financially because we don't have as many school-related expenses, but we do spend more on activities like trips to the park or visiting family.

I've always felt that having two jobs would take away from the time I need to be with my kids or to focus on my studies. There was a period when I was working part-time at the community center and also doing some freelance writing on the side\u2014mostly about mindfulness and wellness topics. It wasn't a lot, but it gave me a little extra income and a sense of purpose beyond just my job. I found that writing allowed me to reflect on my own experiences and share them with others in a way that felt meaningful. But honestly, I realized that trying to juggle too much was overwhelming, and I needed to focus on what truly mattered\u2014my family, my health, and my growth. So I stepped back from the freelance work and focused on what I could manage without burning out. I think it's important to know your limits and to prioritize what brings you the most fulfillment, even if it means saying no to other opportunities.\n\n",

I used to think that pushing through stress was the only way to get things done, but now I see that taking time to breathe, journal, and set small goals has made a real difference in how I feel. It's also made me more aware of how my finances and daily responsibilities shape my emotional well-being. I've learned that it's okay to ask for help, whether it's from my family, my community, or even just taking a few minutes to be still and present. I'm still learning, and there are definitely days when I feel overwhelmed, but I'm trying to be kinder to myself and to see my struggles not as failures, but as part of the journey toward a more balanced and meaningful life.",

That includes my part-time income from the community center, my husband's earnings from his job as a mechanic, and any small side income I might have from freelance writing or teaching a mindfulness class now and then. It's not a lot, but it's enough to cover our basic needs and a few small indulgences, like a weekend outing or a special treat for the kids. I've learned to be grateful for what we have, even if it's not extravagant. It's also given me a sense of responsibility\u2014to make every dollar count, to be mindful of our spending, and to ensure that we're building a life that's not just about survival, but about connection, growth, and purpose.

The job doesn't offer traditional benefits like health insurance or paid vacation, which is something I've had to adjust to. Instead, the benefits are more about the intangible things\u2014the sense of purpose, the connections I've made with others, and the way my work aligns with my values. I do have some flexibility in my schedule, which is a big help, and the center offers a small stipend for continuing education, which has been really important as I work toward my master's degree.

She's someone who leads with compassion and always makes time to listen, which means a lot to me.

I usually have a set time each week, like Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., but there are times when I can adjust my hours depending on what's needed at the center or what's going on with my kids. For example, if Lily has an early soccer practice or if I need to attend a class for my master's program, I can sometimes start a bit later or leave a little earlier. That flexibility is really important for me because it allows me to balance my responsibilities without feeling completely overwhelmed. I also have the option to work some weekends or evenings if there are events or programs that need extra support, but I try to keep my schedule as consistent as possible so I can be there for my family. It's not always perfect, but I feel like this level of flexibility helps me stay grounded and present in both my work and personal life.\n\n",

But I also know that we're doing what we can to provide for our family, and that gives me a sense of peace.
