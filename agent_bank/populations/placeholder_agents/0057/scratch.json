  "agent_profile_summary": "Eric Anderson, a 36-year-old international trade professional living in Santa Monica with his wife Sarah and their three-year-old daughter Emma, grew up in the Pacific region with Danish parents who divorced when he was young. After earning a Bachelor’s degree in International Relations, he chose to join a startup in San Francisco over a stable corporate job, a decision that has shaped his career and allowed him to travel and experience diverse cultures. A committed caregiver, he homeschools Emma while balancing his work, which often involves late-night calls and international negotiations. His life is defined by the tension between professional ambition and family life, as he strives to provide stability for his daughter while pursuing growth in his field. His values—rooted in his mother’s dedication to education and community—guide his choices, and he finds balance through surfing, photography, and the close-knit support of his family and friends."
