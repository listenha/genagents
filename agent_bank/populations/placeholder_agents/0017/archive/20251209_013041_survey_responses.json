            "BFI-10_1": "Based on Angela's reflections in the interview, she describes herself as valuing emotional support and being open about her feelings. She mentions needing a sense of security and support from her community and family, which suggests she is more on the introverted side rather than outgoing. However, she also emphasizes the importance of connecting with others and cherishing these relationships, indicating she is not extremely reserved. Given this balance, a score of 3 seems most appropriate, but since the options are limited to 1 or 5, a 5 better captures her introverted tendencies while still allowing for some social engagement.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on Angela's description, she seems to value support and community, and she has mentioned relying on mentors, friends, and family for guidance and support.

This suggests that while Angela faces stress, she is also proactive in handling it and sees herself as capable of managing it well.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Angela Lewis describes herself as someone who has a busy schedule with work and family responsibilities.

She mentions that she tries to focus on positive aspects of her life and maintains a balanced approach to managing stress through activities like journaling and mindfulness. Although Angela acknowledges that her stress levels can be higher during certain times, such as the start of the school year or soccer season, she doesn't seem to describe herself as someone who gets nervous easily in general.
