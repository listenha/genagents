Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nStephanie Wilson: I was born in Texas, in a small town in the West South Central region, and I remember my childhood being pretty typical for someone growing up in that part of the country. My parents were both working-class folks who didn't have a lot of formal education\u2014my father only made it through high school, and my mother did too, but she worked a lot of different jobs to help support the family. We lived in a modest house, and while we weren't poor, we weren't rich either. I remember my mother always saying that she wanted more for me than she had, and that's probably what pushed me to work hard in school. I was a pretty good student, and I always knew I wanted to go to college. I ended up moving to Austin for my undergraduate studies, and then later stayed for my graduate work. I never married, and I've always been focused on my career. I work full-time now as a researcher, and while I'm not super wealthy, I'm doing okay. I've never served in the military, and I've always identified as a strong Democrat. I grew up Protestant, and I still consider myself one today. Life hasn't been super dramatic, but I've always tried to make the best of it.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nStephanie Wilson: Yes, there was definitely a crossroads moment for me. I was in my second year of undergrad, and I had the chance to apply for a research assistant position in a lab that was studying environmental policy. It was a pretty competitive spot, and I wasn't sure if I had what it took. But I decided to go for it, partly because I wanted to prove to myself that I could handle the pressure, and partly because I felt like this was the kind of work that could make a real difference in the world. I got the job, and that experience completely changed the trajectory of my life. It opened my eyes to the power of research and policy work, and it solidified my passion for environmental issues. I ended up pursuing a master's in public policy, and that led me to my current job as a researcher focused on sustainable development. If I hadn't taken that risk and applied for that position, I probably wouldn't be where I am today. It was a scary decision at the time, but looking back, I know it was the right one.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nStephanie Wilson: I think it was a conscious choice, but not in the way you might expect. I wasn't necessarily thinking, 'This is the moment that will define my life.' Instead, I was just trying to do what felt right in that moment. I remember sitting in my dorm room, staring at the application, and thinking, 'What if I don't get it? What if I fail?' But I also thought, 'What if I don't try? What if I look back one day and wonder what could have been?' So I made the choice to apply, not because I was sure of the outcome, but because I wanted to be the kind of person who takes risks and follows through. I think that moment taught me something important about myself\u2014that I'm more resilient than I gave myself credit for, and that I have a quiet but steady determination. It wasn't just about the job; it was about proving to myself that I could step outside my comfort zone and make a difference.\n\n",

My professor, Dr. Martinez, had a way of seeing potential in people even when they couldn't see it in themselves. She was the one who suggested I apply for that research assistant position, and she spent time helping me refine my application and prepare for the interview. She believed in me when I wasn't sure I deserved that kind of belief. Then there was my mother, who always pushed me to aim higher than she ever could. She didn't have the education or the opportunities I have, but she never let me forget that I had the chance to do better. I think it's those kinds of people\u2014mentors, family, even friends\u2014who make all the difference when you're standing at a crossroads. Without their support, I might have hesitated too long or not taken the leap at all.\n\n",

I've always been pretty focused on my career and my work, and I think that's why I've never really pursued a long-term romantic relationship. I've had friends who have been in committed partnerships, and I admire the way they balance their personal and professional lives, but I've never felt that same pull. I'm not lonely, by any means\u2014I have a close-knit group of friends, and my family is still very much a part of my life. My parents live in Oklahoma now, and we stay in touch regularly. They're proud of me, even if they don't always understand the work I do. I think they see me as this successful, independent woman who's made it on her own, and in a way, that's true. But I also know that I wouldn't be where I am without their support, their sacrifices, and their belief in me. I guess I'm just content with the life I've built so far, even if it's not the one I imagined when I was younger.\n\n",

He's always been more of a hands-on person, while I've always leaned toward academics and research. We don't see each other as often as I'd like, but when we do, it's always a good time. He's got a great sense of humor and a way of making me laugh even when I'm stressed about work. I think he looks up to me in some ways, even if he'll never admit it.

One of them, Lisa, I met in graduate school. We bonded over our shared passion for social justice and environmental issues, and we've been friends ever since. She's the kind of person who will call me out when I'm being too stubborn or too set in my ways, but she's also the first one to celebrate my successes. We don't see each other as often as we'd like because of our busy schedules, but when we do, it's like no time has passed. Then there's Marcus, who I met through a community volunteer group. He's a teacher in the Austin public school system, and he's always been a great source of perspective for me. He reminds me that the work I do\u2014research and policy\u2014has real-world implications for people's lives, and that keeps me grounded. I don't know where I'd be without them.

It's not the most traditional part of the city, but I love how it feels like a community that's constantly evolving. There are a lot of artists, young professionals, and activists who live here, which makes it feel dynamic and full of energy. My apartment is in a converted warehouse, and while it's a bit on the smaller side, it's cozy and has a lot of natural light. I like that I'm close to downtown, so I can walk to work or grab a coffee at one of the local cafes. There's also a community garden nearby that I sometimes volunteer at, which keeps me connected to the people around me.

The community is pretty tight-knit, and there's a sense of mutual respect among the residents. I know there are areas where things can get rough, especially late at night, but I've always been careful and mindful of my surroundings. I also feel like the local businesses and community groups contribute to a sense of security\u2014there's a lot of activity, and people look out for each other.

On the positive side, I love the energy of the neighborhood\u2014the way it feels like there's always something happening, whether it's a local art show, a community meeting, or just people hanging out on the street corner. It's inspiring to be around so many creative and passionate people.

It's rare to live in a place where you can walk or bike almost anywhere you need to go. That said, there are definitely challenges. The noise can be overwhelming at times, especially if I'm trying to focus on work or get a good night's sleep. And while the neighborhood is diverse and welcoming, I've noticed that there are still some gaps in resources for lower-income residents, which is something I've been thinking about more as I've gotten deeper into my work on sustainable development. It's a place that's constantly changing, and I think that's both exciting and a bit exhausting. But overall, I feel like I'm where I'm meant to be, even if it's not always easy.\n\n",

First, tell me all about your health.\n\nStephanie Wilson: In terms of my health, I'd say I'm generally in pretty good shape, though I've had my share of ups and downs. I've always been pretty active, mostly because I grew up in a family that valued physical labor\u2014my father worked construction, and my mother was always on her feet with her various jobs. I didn't inherit their stamina, but I've made an effort to stay in shape through walking, jogging, and yoga, which I started a few years ago. I think yoga has been especially helpful for managing stress, especially with the demands of my job. I do have some chronic issues, like mild back pain from sitting at a desk all day, and I've had to be more mindful about posture and taking breaks. I also deal with occasional anxiety, which I've learned to manage through mindfulness and talking to friends or my therapist when I need to. I used to ignore it, thinking I could just power through, but I've come to realize that taking care of my mental health is just as important as my physical health. I try to eat well, mostly plant-based, and I avoid processed foods as much as possible.

Those small choices add up, and they help me feel more in control of my body and mind. I also find that eating plant-based and trying to cook at home more often makes it easier to stay on track with my health goals. But the hard part is consistency, especially when work gets busy or when I'm overwhelmed with deadlines. There are days when I skip my walk or grab a fast-food meal instead of cooking something healthy because it's quicker. I think the biggest challenge is balancing my professional responsibilities with self-care. I've learned that I can't do it all perfectly, but I'm trying to be more intentional about making time for my health, even if it's just a few minutes of deep breathing or a quick stretch during the day.

About a year ago, I was diagnosed with a mild case of carpal tunnel syndrome, probably from spending so much time typing and analyzing data on the computer. It started with some numbness in my hands, and I didn't realize how serious it was until I started having trouble gripping things properly. I had to see a specialist, and they recommended ergonomic adjustments to my workspace, along with some physical therapy exercises. It's been a slow process, but I've managed to get it under control. Then, earlier this year, I had a flare-up of my back pain, which I think is related to the long hours I spend sitting at my desk. I had to take a few days off work to rest and see a chiropractor, which was a bit of a wake-up call. It made me realize that I need to be more proactive about my health, not just reactive. I've started taking more breaks during the day, doing some light stretching, and even investing in a standing desk. It's not perfect, but I'm learning that taking care of my body is just as important as taking care of my work or my mind.\n\n",

How about you?\n\nStephanie Wilson: Honestly, my health issues haven't really interfered with my ability to work, but they've definitely made me more aware of how fragile things can be. I've had days where the carpal tunnel pain made it hard to type, and I had to switch to voice-to-text or take more breaks, which slowed me down a bit. The back pain was more disruptive, especially when I had to take a few days off. It was frustrating because I felt like I was falling behind, but it also forced me to slow down and reevaluate how I approach my work. I think the biggest thing is that these health challenges have made me more empathetic toward others who struggle with chronic conditions or injuries. I used to think that if you just worked harder or pushed through, you could overcome anything, but now I see that it's not always that simple. It's taught me to be more compassionate, both toward myself and others, and to prioritize balance in a way I didn't before.\n\n",

On one hand, I feel more grounded and intentional about how I live my life\u2014whether it's through the mindfulness practices I've started, the way I'm balancing work with self-care, or the time I'm spending with friends and family. I've been really proud of myself for making those small but meaningful changes, like taking better care of my health and being more present in my daily life. But there have also been moments of doubt and stress, especially with the ongoing challenges in my work. The research I'm doing is important, but it's also incredibly demanding, and there are days when I feel like I'm not making enough of a difference. I've been thinking a lot about the impact of my work, and sometimes it's hard to see the results of what I do. I also feel a bit of loneliness at times, even though I have a good support system. I guess it's just part of being a single, career-focused woman in my 30s\u2014there's a lot of pressure to have it all together, and I'm still learning how to accept that it's okay to not have all the answers or to feel overwhelmed sometimes. But overall, I feel like I'm growing, and that gives me hope for the future.\n\n",

I used to push through it, thinking that if I just worked harder or stayed busy, the anxiety would go away. But over time, I've learned that it's not that simple. I started seeing a therapist a few years ago, and that's been really helpful. It's given me tools to manage my thoughts and emotions in a healthier way. I still have days when the anxiety creeps in, especially when I'm facing a big project or feeling like I'm not enough. But I've come to accept that it's a part of me, and that's okay.

They've never been ones to ask for much, but I can tell they worry about me sometimes\u2014especially when I'm working long hours or dealing with health issues. My mother, in particular, has a way of letting her worries show through small comments, like asking if I'm eating enough or if I'm getting enough rest. My father is more reserved, but I know he's proud of me in his own way. As for my brother, Michael, he's been supportive too, even if he doesn't always understand the details of my work. He's more practical, and he sees my research as something abstract, but he respects that I'm doing what I love. I think the biggest thing for my family is that they see me as someone who's made it on her own, and that means a lot to them.

For me, it's more about the values that came with being raised Protestant\u2014things like community, compassion, and the idea that we're all connected in some way. I don't go to church as often as I used to, and I don't really follow the traditions the way my parents did, but I still find meaning in the core teachings.

I believe in doing good, in helping those who need it, and in being part of something bigger than myself.

I do follow a few environmental organizations and some local community groups, just to stay informed about what's happening in my area and the causes I care about.

My biggest expenses are usually rent, groceries, and transportation. I live in a converted warehouse apartment in East Side, and while it's not the cheapest place in Austin, it's affordable compared to other parts of the city. Rent takes up about a third of my income, which is a lot, but I've learned to live simply and prioritize what's important. Groceries are another big one\u2014since I try to eat plant-based and cook at home, it's not as expensive as it could be, but I still have to be careful with my budget. I also have a monthly public transit pass, which is necessary for getting around, especially since I don't own a car. I've had to cut back on some things, like dining out or buying new clothes, but I've found that I don't miss it as much as I thought I would.

The breakdown is pretty consistent\u2014rent is the biggest chunk, around $1,200, followed by groceries at about $400. I also spend roughly $200 on public transportation and utilities, and another $200 on miscellaneous things like personal care, books, and the occasional coffee or meal out. I've been trying to be more mindful of my spending, especially with the health issues I've been dealing with, which have added some unexpected costs like physical therapy sessions and ergonomic equipment for my workspace.

I chose to rent rather than buy because I wanted more flexibility, especially with my career and the possibility of moving for work opportunities in the future. Renting also makes more sense financially given my income and the current real estate market in Austin.

For example, during the winter months, my heating bill tends to go up a bit, which is something I didn't really account for when I first moved into the apartment. I also noticed that my utility costs spiked a little last summer when we had a heatwave and I was using the air conditioner more frequently. Then there were the holidays\u2014around Thanksgiving and Christmas, I tend to spend a bit more on groceries and small gifts for friends or family, which adds up. I also had to factor in the cost of my physical therapy sessions and ergonomic adjustments for my workspace after my carpal tunnel diagnosis, which were unexpected expenses. On the flip side, there are months when I spend less, like in the spring when I don't need as much heating or cooling, and when I'm more focused on saving money for the future. It's been a learning experience in managing my budget, and I've started tracking my expenses more closely to better anticipate these fluctuations.

It wasn't anything formal, but it helped me build my skills and get my foot in the door in the field. Even now, I occasionally take on freelance work, especially when I have some flexibility in my schedule. It keeps me engaged and challenged, and it's a good way to supplement my income without the pressure of a full-time job. I think it's also helped me stay connected to the research community and keep my skills sharp. I don't do it all the time, but when I do, it feels like a nice balance between my main job and my personal growth.\n\n",

Dealing with health challenges and the pressures of my work has forced me to slow down and reevaluate how I approach my life. I've learned that balance is key\u2014not just in my career, but in my overall well-being. I used to think I could push through everything, but now I see that taking care of my body and mind is just as important as making an impact in my field. These experiences have also made me more empathetic toward others who struggle with chronic conditions or financial stress, and I'm trying to be kinder to myself when I feel overwhelmed. It's not always easy, but I'm grateful for the progress I've made and the awareness that comes with it. I've also realized how much my relationships and personal habits shape my well-being, and I'm learning to be more intentional about how I spend my time and energy, both online and offline.",

That includes my full-time salary as a researcher, which is around $3,500 after taxes, and a small amount from the freelance projects I took on during the weekends. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover my rent, groceries, and other essentials, with a little left over for savings or small indulgences. I've always been pretty frugal, and I think that's helped me make the most of what I have. I also try to be mindful of my spending, especially with the health issues I've been dealing with, which have added some unexpected costs.

When I first started, I was still figuring out my place in the field, and I had to work pretty hard to prove myself. But over time, I've grown into my role and developed a good relationship with my colleagues. The benefits of the job are pretty standard for a non-profit\u2014health insurance is one of the biggest ones, which is a relief, especially with the health issues I've been dealing with. We also get a generous amount of paid time off, which I've started to use more intentionally now that I'm learning to prioritize my well-being. I used to think taking time off was a sign of weakness, but now I see it as necessary. We have sick days, vacation days, and even some days set aside for professional development, which I've taken advantage of a few times. I think the best part is that the work feels meaningful, and that makes all the difference, even on the days when the benefits don't feel like enough.\n\n",

I have a good rapport with my manager, Dr. Elena Torres, who's been a big supporter of mine since I started. She's always encouraged me to take on challenging projects and has given me a lot of autonomy in how I approach my work. I think she sees potential in me, and that's been motivating. As for my coworkers, we get along well\u2014there's a sense of camaraderie, especially since we're all working toward similar goals in sustainable development. We have a few people who are more senior, and I've learned a lot from them, but I also have a few younger colleagues who I mentor in return.

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nStephanie Wilson: My work schedule is pretty flexible, which I think is one of the things I appreciate most about this job. While I do have core hours\u2014usually from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u2014there's a lot of leeway when it comes to starting or ending the day, especially if I'm working remotely or collaborating with people in different time zones. That flexibility has been a lifesaver, especially with the health challenges I've faced. For example, if I'm having a particularly rough day with my back pain or carpal tunnel, I can adjust my schedule a bit to take breaks or work from home if needed. That said, there are times when the flexibility can be a double-edged sword. Without clear boundaries, it's easy to end up working late into the evening or on weekends, especially when I'm deep in a project. I've been trying to be more intentional about setting limits, like turning off work notifications after 7 p.m. or taking a full day off when I need to recharge. It's not always easy, but I think the flexibility is worth it, as long as I remember to use it wisely.\n\n",

I'm not struggling, but I also know I'm not in a position of financial security the way some of my friends or colleagues are. I've always been pretty frugal, and I think that's helped me make the most of what I have. I can cover my basic needs\u2014rent, groceries, transportation\u2014and I even manage to save a little each month, which gives me some peace of mind. But I also know that if something unexpected happened, like a major health issue or a sudden loss of income, I wouldn't be able to handle it as easily as I'd like. I've been thinking a lot about this lately, especially with the health challenges I've faced. It's made me more aware of how important it is to plan for the future, even if I can't see it all clearly right now. I don't want to live in fear, but I also don't want to be caught off guard if things take a turn. So I'm trying to be more intentional about saving, investing in my health, and making sure I'm not stretching too thin. It's a balancing act, but I think it's one I can manage if I keep showing up for myself the way I've always shown up for my work.\n\n",

It was a tough job\u2014long hours, physical strain, and the constant risk of injury\u2014but he was good at what he did.

She also did some administrative work for a local nonprofit, which was something I remember her talking about with pride. She didn't make a lot of money, but she always found ways to stretch what she had and make sure we were taken care of.

I never imagined that applying for that research assistant position in college would lead me to where I am today, but looking back, I can see how each decision, no matter how small, contributed to the person I've become. I've learned that resilience isn't about never struggling, but about pushing through despite the challenges. My family, especially my mother and father, taught me the value of hard work and sacrifice, and I carry that with me every day. My career has been my focus, but I've also come to appreciate the importance of balance\u2014between work and self-care, between ambition and contentment.
