  "agent_profile_summary": "Patrick O'Reilly, a 36-year-old social worker from Cambridge, Massachusetts, grew up moving between states with his parents, who instilled in him a strong work ethic and a commitment to community. After high school, he chose to attend community college before pursuing a degree in social work, a decision that reflected his desire to help others and make a tangible difference in people’s lives. Now working full-time at a local non-profit, he dedicates his days to supporting individuals and families through challenging circumstances, often balancing emotional demands with a structured routine of self-care and mindfulness. His career is deeply rooted in values of compassion and integrity, shaped by his Irish heritage and early exposure to his parents’ professional lives. Patrick remains focused on advancing his work in social services while nurturing close ties with his family and friends, navigating the ongoing tension between his professional mission and the need for personal balance."
