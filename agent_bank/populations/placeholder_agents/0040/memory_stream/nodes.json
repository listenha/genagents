Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nPatrick O'Reilly: Sure, let's take it from the beginning. I was born in Boston, but my family moved around quite a bit when I was young. My father, a lawyer, and my mother, who worked as a teacher, both pursued advanced degrees, which meant we lived in different states for various periods. By the time I was sixteen, we had settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where I started high school. Growing up, I always felt like I straddled two worlds\u2014my Irish heritage and American culture. My parents instilled in me a strong work ethic and a sense of community responsibility, which has stayed with me to this day.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nPatrick O'Reilly: Certainly, one significant moment was when I graduated from high school. It was a pivotal point because I had to decide what to do next. My parents were pushing me towards a prestigious university, but something in me felt drawn towards a career in public service. I had always been interested in helping others and making a positive impact in my community. After much deliberation, I decided to attend a community college first, where I could explore my interests and gain some practical experience. This decision allowed me to find my footing before committing to a four-year program. It was a turning point that ultimately led me to pursue a degree in social work.\n\n",

My parents' encouragement and my own curiosity about social issues played a big role. I remember discussing my options with them, and they supported my desire to start with community college. They believed in giving me the freedom to explore and figure things out on my own, which was incredibly liberating.\n\n",

I've also been incorporating more mindfulness practices into my routine, like deep breathing exercises and brief meditations during breaks. These small changes have made a big difference in how I handle the emotional demands of my job. I still have moments where I feel overwhelmed, but I try to acknowledge those feelings and take steps to address them.\n\n",

What were your biggest expenses last month?\n\nPatrick O'Reilly: When it comes to making ends meet, my budget is pretty straightforward. Rent and utilities take up the largest chunk, followed by groceries and transportation. I try to keep my expenses low by cooking at home most of the time and carpooling or using public transit when I can. Monthly, I allocate some money for entertainment and hobbies, like buying new running gear or grabbing a coffee with friends. Of course, there are occasional bigger expenses, like car maintenance or medical bills, but I try to plan for those in advance. Overall, it's a balanced budget that allows me to maintain my quality of life while staying within my means.\n\n",

Groceries and dining out cost around $600, and transportation was roughly $200, including public transit passes and occasional rideshare use. My usual monthly budget includes some money for personal care items, entertainment, and occasional dinners out with friends, which adds up to about $500.

In the winter, heating costs went up, which added a bit to the utility bill. Spring brought more outdoor activities, so groceries and transportation increased as I spent more time running errands and buying supplies for picnics and outings. Summer was a bit more relaxed, with fewer indoor activities, but travel plans and vacations also pushed my budget. Fall saw a return to more indoor activities, and school started for my sister's kids, which meant more back-to-school shopping and possibly a slight uptick in childcare costs. Overall, it's a mix of regular expenses with some seasonal variations.\n\n",
