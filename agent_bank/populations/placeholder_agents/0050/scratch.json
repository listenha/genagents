  "agent_profile_summary": "Rebekah Ortiz, 19, was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama, in a working-class family where her parents instilled values of hard work and dedication. After graduating high school, she chose to enroll in community college despite financial challenges, taking on student loans to pursue education—a decision that shaped her political views and commitment to community service. Today, she balances part-time work at a local bookstore, volunteer efforts at a food bank, and studies, all while maintaining close ties with her parents and a small circle of supportive friends and mentors. Her life is defined by a drive to contribute to her community, whether through organizing internships for students or participating in local initiatives. Though she faces the tension between financial stability and personal growth, Rebekah remains focused on completing her degree and building a future that allows her to give back, reflecting a deep sense of purpose rooted in her upbringing and experiences."
