Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAngela Williams: I was born in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, but I moved to the United States when I was just five years old. My parents were both teachers, and they worked hard to give me and my younger brother a good education. Life was tough in the beginning\u2014my father passed away when I was 13, which was a huge loss for our family. My mother took on extra jobs to keep us afloat, and she always made sure we had what we needed, even if it wasn't much. I grew up in a small apartment in Brooklyn, and I remember walking to school every day, often missing breakfast because we couldn't afford much. I was a quiet kid, but I loved reading and writing. I got into a community college right after high school, and I worked part-time at a local bookstore to help pay for my tuition. I eventually transferred to a four-year university in North Carolina, where I earned my bachelor's degree in English. I've been working full-time as a content writer for the past six years, and I've been living in Raleigh for about four years now. I'm divorced, and I have a son who's eight years old. He lives with me, and I'm trying to give him the stability I didn't always have. I speak Swahili at home, and I still keep in touch with my extended family in Tanzania. Life hasn't always been easy, but I've learned to be resilient and to find strength in the little things.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAngela Williams: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped the course of my life. It happened when I was 17, right after my father passed away. I was in high school, and I felt like the world had shifted beneath me. My mother was working two jobs, and I was struggling to keep up with school while also trying to help out at home. I remember one night, after working late at the bookstore where I had my first part-time job, I sat down and thought about my future. I realized that if I didn't take control of my education, I might end up stuck in the same cycle of poverty that my parents had fought so hard to escape. So I made a decision\u2014I would apply to community college the next semester, even if it meant working even more hours to afford it. That choice led me to a scholarship opportunity I wouldn't have known about otherwise, and it opened doors I never imagined. It was a tough path, but it taught me the power of perseverance and the importance of making choices that align with your long-term goals, even when the road ahead is uncertain.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nAngela Williams: I think for me, it was a conscious choice, but not one I made lightly. It felt like I was standing at the edge of a cliff, and I had to decide whether to step back into the safety of the familiar or take the leap into something unknown. I didn't have a lot of resources or support, but I had my mother's example\u2014she never gave up, even when things were impossible. I remember telling myself, 'If she could do it, then so can I.' That moment wasn't just about education; it was about taking responsibility for my future and not letting my circumstances define me. I didn't have a grand plan, but I had a clear goal: to break the cycle. And I knew that if I didn't act, I might never have the chance again.\n\n",

I think if I had reached out to someone or accessed the right resources, it might have made things a little easier. But at the time, I didn't know where to start. My mother was doing everything she could, but she didn't have the time or the connections to help me navigate college applications or scholarships. I remember thinking that asking for help would be a sign of weakness, especially in our community where people often pride themselves on being self-reliant. Looking back, I wish I had been more open to support\u2014whether it was from teachers, mentors, or even local organizations. There were a few teachers at my high school who saw potential in me and encouraged me to apply for scholarships, but I was too scared to take them up on it. It wasn't until I was already in community college that I realized how much I had missed out on. So, yes, I think a helping hand could have made a difference, but I also think it took me a while to recognize that I needed one.\n\n",

Do you have a partner, or children?\n\nAngela Williams: I currently don't have a partner, but I have an eight-year-old son named Elijah who lives with me. He's a bright and curious kid, and I try my best to be there for him every day. His father and I were married for about five years, but the marriage didn't last. It was a tough time for both of us, but I'm grateful that we've maintained a civil relationship for his sake. Elijah is a big fan of superheroes and loves to read\u2014just like I did when I was his age. I try to read to him every night, and it's one of the few moments where I feel like I'm giving him the kind of childhood I wish I'd had. My mother is still very involved in his life, and she helps out as much as she can. I also have a younger brother who's in his early twenties, and we stay in touch through calls and messages. He's just starting out in his career, and I try to be a source of support for him as well. Family has always been important to me, even when things got difficult, and I want to make sure that Elijah knows how much he's loved and valued.\n\n",

It was humbling to revisit the challenges I faced growing up, especially after my father's passing and the struggles we had financially. I never thought about how much of my life was shaped by that one decision at 17 to pursue education, even when it felt impossible. It's funny how something so small at the time\u2014choosing to apply to community college\u2014ended up changing everything. I also realized how much I missed out on by not reaching out for help when I needed it most. Now, as a mother, I'm determined to be different. I want Elijah to know that it's okay to ask for help, that it's okay to dream big, and that no matter how hard life gets, you can always find a way forward. I hope my story can inspire others who are facing their own crossroads, even if they don't see the path clearly yet.",

My relationship with my mother is very close\u2014she's been my rock through everything, and I admire her strength and resilience.

One of them is Maria, a coworker I met when I first started at the content writing company. She's been a great support system, especially during the divorce and the early years of raising Elijah alone. We've been friends for over a decade now, and she's the one who encouraged me to start writing my own stories\u2014both professionally and personally. There's also a mentor from my community college days, Mr. Thompson, who was the first to really believe in me and push me to apply for that scholarship that changed everything. I still keep in touch with him, and he's been a steady presence in my life. Then there's my best friend from high school, Aisha, who moved to Raleigh a few years back. We don't see each other as often as I'd like, but when we do, it's like no time has passed. She's the one who reminded me of my dreams when I was feeling lost.

There's a small park nearby where Elijah and I like to go on weekends\u2014sometimes we have a picnic, or he plays with the other kids.

I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism last year, which came as a bit of a surprise. I had been feeling sluggish for a while, always tired no matter how much sleep I got, and I noticed my hair was thinning and my skin was dry.

How about you?\n\nAngela Williams: At first, the hypothyroidism did make things a little harder. I was so tired all the time that I found myself struggling to keep up with work and Elijah's needs. There were days when I would just sit on the couch and feel like I couldn't move, and I worried that I wasn't being the mother or the professional I wanted to be. But once I started taking the medication and made some changes to my lifestyle, it got better. I learned that I couldn't push through everything on my own\u2014I had to ask for help when I needed it, whether it was from my therapist, my friends, or even just taking a few minutes to breathe when I felt overwhelmed. It also made me more aware of how important it is to take care of myself, not just for my own sake, but because Elijah needs me to be strong and present. Now, I try to be more proactive about my health, and I've started setting aside time each day to check in with how I'm feeling. It's not always easy, but I'm learning that taking care of myself is part of being a good parent, and that's something I want to model for Elijah.\n\n",

Becoming a single mother was already a huge adjustment, but adding the challenge of managing my health on top of that made things even more complicated. There were times when I felt like I wasn't doing enough for Elijah or for myself, and I worried that I was setting a bad example. But I've also learned so much about resilience, about how to ask for help, and about the importance of small, consistent efforts. I've started to see that progress doesn't always look like a big leap\u2014it can be as simple as getting out of bed on a tough morning or taking a few deep breaths when the world feels too heavy. I'm still learning, and I'm still growing, but I feel more hopeful than I have in a long time. I want Elijah to see that life isn't always easy, but it's always worth fighting for.\n\n",

Starting the writing group for single parents was a turning point for me\u2014it gave me a sense of purpose beyond just being a mother and a worker. It also reminded me how important it is to take care of myself, even in small ways, like meditating in the morning or tending to my garden. I've come to understand that my health isn't just about physical well-being, but also about emotional resilience and the strength to ask for help when I need it. These changes, though small, have helped me build a more balanced life for myself and for Elijah.

There were days when I felt like I was drowning in responsibilities, and I worried that I wasn't doing enough for my son or that I'd never be able to get ahead. I remember one night, after a particularly stressful day, I sat in the kitchen with a cup of tea and just cried\u2014didn't even know why, just felt like everything was too much.

But he's a resilient kid, and I've seen him develop a strength that I didn't expect. He's always been curious and kind, and I think those traits have helped him navigate the changes in our lives. My mother has been a constant support, and even though she's not always here in person, her love and guidance have been a huge part of his life.

My parents were Protestant, and we attended church regularly when I was a child. But as I got older, I found myself questioning a lot of the things I was taught, and eventually, I drifted away from organized religion. Now, I don't identify with any specific faith, but I do believe in something bigger than myself\u2014whether that's the strength of the human spirit, the resilience of my community, or the love I feel for my son. I think of it more as a personal kind of spirituality, something that helps me stay grounded and connected to the world around me. I don't need a church to feel that, and I don't think it's something I need to explain or justify.

I find that it can be both a distraction and a source of stress, especially when I'm trying to focus on work or spend quality time with Elijah. I do have a Facebook account, mostly to stay in touch with family back in Tanzania and some old friends from high school. I post rarely\u2014maybe a photo of Elijah doing something cute or a simple update about our day.

I also have to account for my car payment, which is about $250 a month, and utilities like electricity and internet, which run around $150.

It was a hard decision, but I've come to realize that my job isn't just about earning money\u2014it's about being present for him, even when it's difficult. I've also learned to be more strategic about my work, like taking on projects that are flexible or that allow me to work from home, so I can still be there for Elijah when he needs me most.\n\n",

I used to think that being strong meant carrying everything on my own, but now I understand that it's okay to ask for help, whether it's from friends, family, or even just taking a moment to breathe and reset. I've also learned to be more mindful of my emotional health, using journaling and small daily rituals like walking in the garden or listening to music to find balance. Financially, I've come to accept that stability doesn't always mean having a lot\u2014it means making smart choices, budgeting carefully, and prioritizing what truly matters: my son's well-being and our ability to live with dignity and peace. I'm still learning, but I feel more grounded than I have in a long time, and I hope that sense of balance and resilience continues to grow in both my life and Elijah's.",

That comes from my full-time job as a content writer, and I'm lucky to have a steady income that covers most of our needs. I don't make a ton, but I've learned to live within my means and prioritize what truly matters. I also occasionally take on small freelance writing gigs when I have the time, which helps supplement our budget a little. It's not always easy, especially when I'm working late or dealing with health issues, but I've come to accept that this is the reality for many single parents. What I'm most proud of is that I've managed to provide Elijah with a stable home, good food, and the opportunity to grow and learn. I know we're not wealthy, but I believe that happiness and security don't always come from having a lot\u2014they come from knowing you're doing your best, and that you're loved.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nAngela Williams: I've been at my current job for about six years now, and it's been a journey of growth and learning. The company offers a few benefits, like health insurance, which has been a lifesaver, especially since I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism last year. I also get a certain number of paid days off, which I try to use for rest, family time, or even just a day to myself when I need it most. The flexibility of working remotely has been a huge blessing, especially as a single mother\u2014it allows me to be there for Elijah without having to commute long hours or miss important moments. I don't have a lot of vacation days, but I do appreciate the sick time, because there are days when I just need to take a step back and focus on my health. Overall, I'm grateful for the stability this job provides, even if it's not perfect. It's given me the chance to build a career I can be proud of, and that's something I want to pass on to Elijah\u2014showing him that hard work and dedication can lead to a better life, even if it's not always easy.\n\n",

I've been lucky to have a manager who's supportive and understands the challenges of balancing work and life, especially as a single parent. She's never made me feel like I had to choose between being a good employee or being there for Elijah. In fact, she's been flexible with my schedule when I needed to adjust for school events or medical appointments. As for my coworkers, most of them are friendly and understanding. We don't always have deep conversations, but there's a sense of mutual respect. I've had a few coworkers who have become good friends, and I really appreciate the camaraderie. It's not always easy being a remote worker, but the company has made an effort to foster a sense of community, even online. I think the key to my good relationships at work is that I try to be professional, kind, and open to collaboration. I've learned that showing up with a positive attitude goes a long way, and I'm grateful for the people I work with who make this job more than just a paycheck\u2014it's also a place where I feel valued and supported.\n\n",

Most of my projects have deadlines, so I have to plan my time accordingly, but I don't have to be in the office at a specific time every day. That flexibility has been a huge help, especially as a single mother. I can work from my home office in the morning, take Elijah to the library or his after-school program, and then come back to finish up the rest of my work in the evening if needed. It's not always perfect\u2014there are days when I have to stay late to meet a deadline, or when I have to work on weekends if a project is behind\u2014but overall, I feel like I have a good balance.

After my father passed away when I was 13, she took on two jobs to make sure we could keep our small apartment in Brooklyn and afford basic things like food, school supplies, and even a few extracurricular activities for me and my brother. She worked as a substitute teacher during the school year and did cleaning jobs on the weekends. I remember how tired she looked some days, but she never complained.

I think that's why I always felt a sense of responsibility to do well in school and make something of myself\u2014because I knew she was working so hard to give us a chance.

She was always juggling between her two jobs, but she never let us see how exhausted she was.

It wasn't the most stable job, but it gave her a sense of purpose and a way to connect with the kids in the classroom.
