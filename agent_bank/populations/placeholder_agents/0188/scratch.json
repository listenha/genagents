  "agent_profile_summary": "Angela Williams, a 35-year-old content writer living in Raleigh, North Carolina, grew up in Tanzania before moving to the U.S. at age five. After her father’s death when she was 13, she made the conscious decision to pursue education as a path out of poverty, enrolling in community college while working part-time. Now a single mother to an eight-year-old son, Elijah, she balances her full-time job with raising him in Willow Creek, a neighborhood she finds safe and supportive. A committed caregiver, she reads to Elijah every night and has started a writing group for single parents to share experiences and support one another. Her life is shaped by a tension between the resilience she inherited from her mother, who worked multiple jobs to support the family, and her own desire to provide Elijah with more stability and opportunities. This drive fuels her work ethic and her efforts to build a better future, even as she navigates the ongoing challenges of health, financial security, and emotional well-being."
