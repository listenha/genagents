Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nJuan Guzman: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Guatemala, but my family moved to the United States when I was just a few months old. We settled in Los Angeles, California. Growing up, I lived with my parents, who both worked to support our family. My mom worked at a local restaurant, while my dad managed a small grocery store. Both of them had less than a high school education, but they always encouraged us to do our best in school.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nJuan Guzman: One significant moment came when I was about 18 years old. I had been accepted into a community college, but due to financial constraints, I couldn't afford tuition. It was a tough decision, but I decided to join the military instead. I served for two years, which was a challenging yet rewarding experience. I learned discipline and teamwork, and it gave me a sense of purpose. However, after my service, I realized that wasn't the path I wanted to take long-term. So, I decided to go back to school, which was a bit daunting since I had to catch up on what I missed during my time away. Eventually, I completed my bachelor's degree in business administration. That was a turning point because it opened up new opportunities for me.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nJuan Guzman: I think for me, it was more of a combination of both. There were moments when I felt like I had to make a choice, but ultimately, those choices were influenced by circumstances beyond my control. The decision to join the military was driven by financial necessity, but once I was there, I found value in the experiences and skills I gained. Going back to school was a conscious decision, but it also felt like a natural progression given the opportunities I saw after my service.\n\n",

My mother often wished she could have afforded to send me to a better school, and her hope and encouragement stayed with me. Now, I understand the importance of providing support to young people in similar situations.\n\n",

The job search has been a constant uphill battle, and there are days when I feel like I'm not making any progress. To cope, I've been relying more on my support network, whether it's talking to friends, attending networking events, or participating in online forums. I've also started journaling more, which helps me process my thoughts and emotions. It's a way to reflect on the progress I've made and remind myself of the reasons why I'm determined to succeed.\n\n",

What were your biggest expenses last month?\n\nJuan Guzman: To cover my expenses, I've been relying on freelance work and occasional gigs. My biggest expenses last month were rent, groceries, and utilities. Rent is a bit of a challenge, as it takes up a significant portion of my budget. Groceries are necessary, but I try to buy mostly staples and avoid eating out. Utilities are also a must, but I'm mindful of conserving water and electricity to keep costs down. Sometimes, I have to dip into savings or ask my parents for help if I'm short on cash.\n\n",

Utilities cost around $200, and I had some additional expenses like internet and phone bills. The rest went towards miscellaneous items like transportation and small household supplies. Usually, I try to keep a strict budget, but the job search and lack of a steady income have made it a bit harder to stick to it.

    "content": "Completing this interview and sharing my life story has been both challenging and enlightening. It's given me a deeper understanding of how my journey has been shaped by both personal decisions and external circumstances. From my early days in Guatemala to my current struggles with unemployment, each step has been a crucial part of who I am today. The support I've received from my family, community, and even through social media has been instrumental in helping me navigate these challenges. Reflecting on my experiences, I realize the importance of resilience and the value of having a strong support network. This interview has reminded me of the significance of community and the impact it can have on one's life. As I move forward, I am determined to continue giving back to the community that has supported me, and to strive for stability and independence. This process of reflection and storytelling has been therapeutic and has reinforced my belief in the power of perseverance and the importance of maintaining a positive outlook, no matter the obstacles.",
