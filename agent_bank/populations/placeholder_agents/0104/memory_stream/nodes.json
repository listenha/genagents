Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMaria Lopez: I was born in Seville, Spain, but I moved to the United States when I was just five years old with my mother and younger brother. My father left us when I was very young, and my mother worked long hours to support us. We lived in a small apartment in a working-class neighborhood, and money was always tight. I remember walking to school with my brother, sometimes skipping meals so we could afford school supplies. My mother never had the chance to finish high school, and she always encouraged me to do better. I worked part-time at a local store after school to help out, but I was determined to get my education. I moved to Miami when I was sixteen, and it was a big change for me. I had to adjust to a new culture, a new language, and a new way of life. I graduated high school and went on to earn my bachelor's degree in business administration. I married my husband, Carlos, a few years ago, and we've been working hard to build a better life for our family. It hasn't been easy, but I believe in perseverance and faith.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMaria Lopez: Yes, there was a moment that changed everything for me. When I turned sixteen, my mother had to move us to Miami because the job opportunities in the small town we were living in were limited, and she wanted a better future for us. It was a difficult decision because I had to leave behind the only home I had ever known, my friends, and the few memories I had of my father. Moving to Miami was overwhelming. I didn't speak English well, and I felt like an outsider in every way. But I remember one specific day\u2014my first day at a new high school in Miami. I was so nervous, and I almost didn't go. My mother had to physically take me to the school, and I cried the entire way there. But once I walked into that classroom, I saw a teacher who looked at me with kindness, not judgment. Her name was Mrs. Thompson, and she stayed after class to help me with my English. That moment made me realize that I had a choice: I could let fear and loneliness define me, or I could push through and take control of my future. I chose the latter. I worked harder in school, joined the school's business club, and eventually earned a scholarship to a local university. That crossroads\u2014standing in that classroom, scared and unsure\u2014was the turning point. It taught me that even in the darkest moments, there is always a way forward if you're willing to take it.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nMaria Lopez: I think it was a conscious choice, even if I didn't realize it at the time. I had to make a decision every single day after moving to Miami\u2014whether to stay in my shell or to try again. I remember one day, after struggling with a math test, I sat in the library for hours, crying, feeling like I would never catch up. But then I thought about my mother, how she had sacrificed everything for me, and I knew I couldn't let her down. That was when I decided I would not just survive, but thrive. I started going to extra help sessions, I asked questions even when I was embarrassed, and I made it a point to learn English outside of class too. It wasn't just about getting good grades\u2014it was about proving to myself that I had the strength to overcome adversity. I think that moment in the classroom with Mrs. Thompson was the spark, but the fire was something I had to keep stoking every day. I chose to believe in myself, and that choice shaped the person I am today.\n\n",

I think if someone had reached out to me when I first arrived in Miami, it could have made a huge difference. I remember feeling so lost, not just because of the language barrier but because I didn't know how to navigate the system\u2014how to get help with school, how to find resources for my family. I think organizations that support immigrants, or even teachers like Mrs. Thompson who took the time to help me, were lifelines. I also think my mother was my biggest support system. She didn't have much, but she never gave up on me. I know there are people out there who are struggling just like I did, and I wish there were more programs to help them feel seen and supported. Sometimes, all it takes is one person to believe in you when you can't believe in yourself.\n\n",

My husband, Carlos, is a mechanic, and he's been my rock since the day we met. We met at a community center in Miami, actually\u2014both of us were volunteering for a local outreach program that helps immigrants. He's from Colombia, and he had his own struggles when he first arrived in the U.S. We bonded over our shared experiences, and we've been married for six years now. We have a daughter, Sofia, who's eight, and a son, Mateo, who's five. They're both bilingual, which I'm very proud of, and they're growing up in a home where we value education, hard work, and faith. My mother still lives in Miami, and though we don't see each other as often as I'd like, she's always there for us. I try to be the kind of mother I never had\u2014supportive, encouraging, and always reminding them that they can achieve anything if they're willing to put in the effort.

She's a single mother too, and we've supported each other through the ups and downs of raising kids while working full-time. She's like a sister to me.

There were days when I felt tired, or when I had to check my blood sugar before going to work, and I worried it would affect my ability to care for my kids. But I've come to see it as part of my responsibility\u2014to take care of myself so I can take care of them. My husband has been incredible, reminding me to eat, to rest, and to not push myself too hard. I've also started setting reminders on my phone for medication and meals, which helps me stay on track. It's not perfect, and there are still days when I feel frustrated, but I know I'm doing the best I can. I've also started talking to other women in my community who have diabetes, and it's comforting to know I'm not alone in this. We share tips, encouragement, and sometimes just a laugh. It's a reminder that even in the hardest times, there's always a way forward\u2014if you're willing to take it one step at a time.\n\n",

My mother taught me that faith is not just about believing in God, but about trusting in the journey, even when you can't see the path ahead. I find peace in the rituals, in the rosary, in the way the church community comes together to support one another. It's also what helped me through my struggles in Miami, when I felt so lost and alone. I still have moments where I question or feel distant, but I always come back to the belief that God has a plan, and that I'm not alone in this life.

That said, I do use Facebook occasionally to stay in touch with my brother in Spain and my cousin Ana here in Miami.

Rent is always the largest chunk of our budget\u2014about a third of our income. We live in a two-bedroom apartment, and while it's not too bad for our family of four, it still takes up a lot.

The kids also need uniforms, books, and other materials for school, and that adds up. I also set aside money for my master's classes, which is another expense I didn't expect when I started. On top of that, there are the medications I need for my blood pressure and diabetes, and the co-pays for my doctor visits. It's tight, but we make it work.

Normally, we budget around $2,800 to $3,000 a month. The increase was mostly due to unexpected expenses\u2014like a new air conditioner for the apartment, which was needed because the old one broke down, and some emergency repairs at home. We also had to pay for a few extra doctor visits for me, and I bought a new laptop for my master's classes since my old one was getting too slow. I try to keep track of everything in a spreadsheet, and it helps me see where the money is going. The biggest fixed costs are always rent, groceries, and the kids' school-related expenses. I also set aside a small amount each month for savings, even if it's just $50 or so. It's not much, but it gives me a sense of security.

Tell me all about how your bills have fluctuated over the past year.\n\nMaria Lopez: Over the past year, our bills have definitely gone up and down depending on the season and what's going on in our lives. In the summer, for example, we had to pay more for air conditioning, and we also spent more on ice for the kids' drinks since it was so hot. In the winter, we used more electricity for heating, and we had to buy extra blankets and warm clothes for the kids. Then there's the holidays\u2014Christmas and Hanukkah, for example, when we have to buy gifts, decorations, and sometimes even go out to dinner with family. Those are always bigger expenses. School also plays a role\u2014when the kids start the school year, we have to buy new uniforms, books, and supplies, which can be a big hit on the budget. On the other hand, there are times when things are cheaper, like when we can buy seasonal produce or take advantage of sales.

I also worked as a volunteer tutor for kids in the community center, which was something I really enjoyed. It gave me a sense of purpose beyond just earning money. Now, with my evening classes, I've had to be even more careful with my schedule, but I still take on extra hours when needed. It's not always easy, but I've learned that having multiple sources of income, even if they're small, can make a big difference in keeping our family afloat.\n\n",

It's been a journey of learning to be kinder to myself, to ask for help when I need it, and to find strength in the people around me. I used to feel like I had to be perfect, but now I understand that it's okay to struggle and that healing is a process. Talking about my monthly budget and how we make ends meet reminded me of the sacrifices my family and I make every day, but also of the resilience we've built together. I'm proud of how far we've come, even if it's not always easy. I know we're not perfect, but we're learning, we're supporting each other, and that's what matters most.",

That includes my full-time salary at the grocery store, some extra shifts I picked up on the weekends, and a small part-time gig tutoring a few kids in math at the community center. My husband also works as a mechanic, though his hours can be inconsistent depending on the shop's workload. We're lucky that both of us are working, and it helps us cover the basics\u2014rent, groceries, the kids' school supplies, and my master's classes.

The job doesn't come with many benefits, like health insurance or paid vacation days, which is something I've had to adjust to. I do get a small amount of sick time, and sometimes the manager is willing to be flexible if I need to take a day off for something important, like a doctor's appointment or a family emergency. I've learned to make the most of what I have\u2014like using my sick days wisely and asking for time off when I really need it. I also appreciate the coworkers I've built relationships with over the years; they're like family to me. Even though the job isn't perfect, it's given me stability, and that's what matters most.

She's given me some opportunities to take on more responsibilities, like training new employees, which I really appreciate. It's not always easy working under someone who has high expectations, but I know she's doing her job, and I try to meet those expectations as best as I can.

I usually work Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., and I've come to rely on that routine because it helps me balance everything else in my life\u2014school, family, and my health. That said, there are days when the manager asks me to stay a little later, especially during busy hours or when we're short-staffed.
