  "agent_profile_summary": "Marissa Haddad, a 20-year-old Syrian-American student in Ann Arbor, Michigan, grew up in a household that valued education and hard work, shaped by her parents’ immigrant experiences. A pivotal moment came when she chose to leave Michigan for college in New York City, embracing independence while staying connected to her roots through family and community. She now balances part-time work at a university library, freelance writing, and volunteering with a non-profit supporting Syrian refugees, all while pursuing her studies. Her life is guided by a commitment to family, cultural heritage, and giving back, reflected in her active participation in Syrian-American cultural events and her efforts to bridge cultural gaps. Navigating academic pressures and personal growth, Marissa remains focused on completing her degree and exploring ways to contribute meaningfully to both her community and the world beyond."
