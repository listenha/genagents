  "agent_profile_summary": "Leticia Johnson, a 30-year-old marketing analyst in Denver, grew up in Honduras before moving to the U.S. as a child, where her parents instilled in her the value of education and hard work. A defining moment came when she ran for student government president during college, a decision that emerged from years of political curiosity and mentorship, ultimately shaping her career and commitment to public service. Today, she balances her full-time job with volunteering at a local food bank and community garden, reflecting her ongoing dedication to social justice and community support. Her life is guided by a tension between professional ambition and the desire to give back, evident in her thoughtful approach to work, relationships, and personal growth. Leticia’s warmth and grounded perspective stem from her belief in collective well-being and the power of small, consistent actions to create meaningful change."
