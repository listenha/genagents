Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nVictoria Petrov: I was born in Moscow, Russia, but I moved to the United States when I was just six years old with my parents, who were both working professionals. My early years were spent in a small apartment in a bustling neighborhood, where I grew up speaking Russian at home and learning English at school. My mother, who had a graduate degree in literature, was very involved in my education, often reading to me in Russian and encouraging me to write stories. My father, who only had a high school education, worked as a mechanic and was more hands-on with my upbringing. I left home at 15 to attend a boarding school in New England, which was a big adjustment for me, but it was there that I really started to find my voice and develop a love for learning. I eventually earned a graduate degree in international relations, which led me to a career in nonprofit work, where I focus on cultural exchange programs. I met my husband, Alex, while volunteering at a community center in Chicago, and we married a few years ago. We live in Naperville now, and while I work part-time, I also enjoy spending time with my family and practicing my Orthodox-Christian faith.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nVictoria Petrov: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped my path. When I was 18, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Prague as part of a cultural exchange program. I was torn because I had just started a part-time job to help support my family after my father lost his job. My mother encouraged me to take the chance, saying that education was the key to our future. I went, and it was there that I met a professor who became a mentor to me. He introduced me to the field of international relations and inspired me to pursue graduate studies. That experience not only changed my academic direction but also gave me a deeper appreciation for the power of cross-cultural understanding. It was the moment I realized I wanted to work in nonprofit organizations that bridge gaps between people from different backgrounds. Without that decision, I don't think I would be where I am today.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nVictoria Petrov: I think, in that moment, I made a conscious choice, but it wasn't entirely my own. My mother had always believed in the power of education, and she pushed me to see the opportunity in Prague not just as a chance to study, but as a way to build a better future for all of us. I remember sitting with her in our small kitchen, the smell of freshly baked pirozhki in the air, and her saying, 'This is your chance, Victoria. Don't let fear stop you.' I knew then that I had to go. It wasn't just about me\u2014it was about the life we were trying to build here. That choice, though difficult, felt like the right one, and it set me on a path I never could have imagined.\n\n",

In fact, I wouldn't have been able to take that opportunity without the support of a local nonprofit that helped me secure the scholarship for the exchange program. They saw potential in me that I didn't always see in myself, and they believed in the value of cross-cultural education. I remember meeting with the director, a woman named Elena, who had emigrated from Ukraine herself. She shared her own story of leaving everything behind for a chance at something better, and that really resonated with me. Her belief in me gave me the courage to step out of my comfort zone. I think it's important to recognize that no one builds a life alone\u2014there are always people and organizations that help light the way, even when we can't see it ourselves.\n\n",

We married a few years ago, and he's been a tremendous support in both my personal and professional life. He works in IT, and while he's not as involved in the nonprofit world as I am, he deeply respects my passion for cultural exchange and often helps me with research or logistics for my projects.

From my early years in Moscow to my decision to study in Prague, each step was influenced by the support of my family, especially my mother, whose belief in education opened doors I never knew existed. The interview reminded me of how pivotal that moment was\u2014not just for my career, but for who I am today. It also made me think about the importance of community and the role of organizations like the one that helped me get to Prague. Without their support, I might never have had the chance to explore my passion for international relations and cultural exchange. Talking about my family and my husband, Alex, brought a sense of gratitude for the life we've built together, rooted in our shared faith and values.

Even though we haven't spoken in a while, she's been a mentor to me in more ways than I can count. Her belief in the power of education and cross-cultural understanding really shaped my own views.

My house is a modest two-story home with a small garden in the back where I grow herbs and flowers. It's a peaceful place, and I love how the neighborhood feels like a small town even though it's part of a larger city. There are a lot of families here, and I often see children playing in the streets or walking to school with their parents. The local park is a favorite spot for me and my husband\u2014we often take walks there, especially on weekends.

However, sometimes I feel like there's a quietness to the place that can be isolating, especially when I'm working on projects that involve people from different backgrounds. I miss the vibrant energy of the city, where there's always something happening, but I've learned to find my own rhythm here. The pace of life is slower, which has allowed me to focus more on my faith and family, but it also means I have to be intentional about staying connected to the broader world.

At the same time, I've also had to confront some personal challenges, like the ongoing back issues I mentioned earlier, which have reminded me to slow down and be more present in my daily life. On a more emotional level, I've been reflecting a lot on my roots\u2014my childhood in Moscow, my time in Prague, and the journey that brought me to Naperville. I've been reconnecting with parts of my heritage, learning more about Russian traditions, and even teaching some of them to my husband, Alex. It's been a beautiful way to honor where I came from while building a life here. I've also been feeling more connected to my faith community, especially through the Orthodox-Christian traditions that have become a cornerstone of my identity. There have been times when I've felt the weight of the world, especially with the global tensions and cultural divides that seem to be growing, but I try to hold onto the hope that through dialogue, understanding, and compassion, we can find ways to bridge those gaps. Overall, I feel like I'm in a good place, even if it's not always easy. I'm learning to embrace the ebb and flow of life, and I'm grateful for the people, experiences, and moments that continue to shape me.\n\n",

How about for you?\n\nVictoria Petrov: I think it's important to be honest about the emotional challenges I've faced, even if I haven't spoken about them much before. There have been times when I've felt a quiet sadness or a sense of isolation, especially when I'm working late or when the weight of the world feels too heavy to carry. I don't think I've ever been diagnosed with clinical depression or anxiety, but there have been moments when I've struggled with feeling overwhelmed or disconnected from the people around me. I've learned to recognize those feelings for what they are\u2014signals that I need to pause, breathe, and reconnect with what truly matters. My faith has been a great anchor for me during those times, and so has my husband, who always knows when to offer a listening ear or a quiet presence. I've also found solace in the small, everyday moments\u2014like tending to my garden, reading a book, or simply sharing a cup of tea with Alex. I believe that everyone has their own way of coping, and for me, it's about finding balance between the challenges of life and the things that bring me peace.\n\n",

My husband, Alex, has been incredibly supportive, not just in my work but also in helping us both find balance in our lives. He's taken on more of the household responsibilities, which has allowed me to focus on my projects and also take the time I need to rest and heal. We've been making an effort to spend more quality time together\u2014whether it's cooking meals at home, going on weekend hikes, or simply sitting on the porch and talking about our dreams. Our faith has also been a source of strength for both of us, especially during moments when the world feels uncertain. We've been attending more church events and participating in community service, which has deepened our sense of purpose. As for my mother, she's been doing well in Russia, though she misses us. She's staying active, gardening, and even started learning English through online classes, which she says is helping her feel more connected to our lives here. It's heartwarming to see her embrace change, even at her age. And my sister, Nadia, has been a constant source of encouragement, even from afar. She's been helping me with some of my projects through her teaching connections in Moscow, which has been a beautiful way for us to stay linked despite the distance. Overall, I feel like my family has been a steady foundation for me, reminding me that no matter how busy or challenging life gets, I'm never truly alone.\n\n",

How about you?\n\nVictoria Petrov: For me, religion is not just a part of my life\u2014it's the foundation upon which I build my sense of purpose, identity, and connection to the world. Growing up in a Russian household, Orthodox-Christian faith was woven into every aspect of our lives, from the way we celebrated holidays to the values we were taught. Even after moving to the United States, that faith has remained a constant, a source of comfort and guidance through both the joys and challenges of life. It's what helps me find meaning in the little things, like the morning prayers I say before starting my day or the way I approach my work with a sense of service and humility. My faith also strengthens my relationships, especially with my husband, Alex, who has come to embrace the traditions and rituals that are so important to me. Through our shared faith, we've built a life that feels rooted and whole, even in the midst of a fast-paced, ever-changing world. I don't always have all the answers, but I know that my faith gives me the strength to keep going, to stay connected to what truly matters, and to believe in the possibility of goodness in people and in the world.\n\n",

I have a Facebook account where I stay in touch with family, especially my mother and sister back in Russia. It's been a lifeline for us, allowing us to share photos, updates, and even video calls when we can't meet in person. I also follow a few pages related to my work in cultural exchange and international relations, which helps me stay informed about events and opportunities in the field. I'm not really into Instagram or TikTok, as I find those platforms a bit too fast-paced for my taste. That said, I do use LinkedIn occasionally for professional networking, especially when I'm looking for collaborators or volunteers for our nonprofit projects.

For me, emotional support has always come from my family, my faith community, and the people I've built relationships with over the years. When I've gone through tough times, like after my father passed away or when I was struggling with my back issues, it was the people I knew in person\u2014my husband, my mother, my friends at church, or even my coworkers at the nonprofit\u2014who offered me comfort and practical help. That said, I do recognize the power of online communities, especially for people who may not have the same support systems in place. I've seen how some of my friends use Facebook groups or forums to find encouragement, share resources, or even raise funds for causes they care about.

There were times when I felt overwhelmed, particularly when planning large events or dealing with the ongoing strain on my back. But I've been learning to manage that stress through intentional coping strategies. One of the most important has been leaning more heavily on my faith\u2014attending more services, participating in prayer groups, and finding comfort in the rituals that ground me. I've also started journaling more regularly, which helps me process my thoughts and emotions in a way that feels safe and constructive. Another change has been how I approach my time with my husband, Alex. We've made a conscious effort to carve out moments of stillness together, whether it's a quiet evening walk or just sitting in silence with a cup of tea. These small acts of presence have been incredibly grounding. I've also found that staying connected with my mother through video calls and sharing stories from our lives has helped ease some of the loneliness that can come with being far from home.

Our biggest expenses last month were related to housing\u2014rent and utilities, which take up a significant portion of our income. We also have regular expenses for groceries, especially since I've been trying to eat more healthily and incorporate more fresh produce into our meals.

In the winter months, our heating bill went up significantly, which is something I didn't expect when we first moved here. I had to adjust our budget a bit to cover that, which meant cutting back on some of the extras we usually enjoy, like dining out or buying new clothes. On the flip side, during the spring and summer, our electricity usage dropped because we were using less heat and more natural light, which helped us save a bit.

While we don't have a lot of extra money, I feel grateful that we're able to live comfortably and support the work we care about. It's a reminder that financial stability isn't just about numbers\u2014it's about having the freedom to live with purpose, love, and connection. And through it all, I'm reminded that I'm never truly alone, because I have the people, practices, and values that sustain me every day.",

That includes my part-time income from the nonprofit, which is about $1,800, and my husband's salary from his IT job, which is roughly $2,400. We also received a small stipend from a volunteer project I was involved in, which added a few hundred dollars. While it's not a huge amount, it's enough to cover our expenses and even allow us to set aside a little for savings or unexpected needs. I've come to appreciate the stability of our income, especially knowing that it allows us to live with purpose and support the work we care about. It's not about wealth, but about having enough to live with dignity, care for one another, and contribute to the community in meaningful ways.\n\n",

The benefits of the job are modest but meaningful. We have health insurance coverage, which is essential for me, especially with my back issues, and we get a certain number of paid days off each year\u2014enough to take short trips or just have some time to rest and recharge. The workplace itself is very supportive, and I appreciate the flexibility they offer, especially with my part-time schedule. There's also a strong sense of community among the staff and volunteers, which makes the work feel more like a shared mission than just a job. While I don't have the same benefits as someone in a full-time corporate position, I find that the intangible rewards\u2014like knowing that my work helps bring people together and fosters understanding\u2014are what truly sustain me. It's not about the perks, but about the impact we're able to make, even in small ways, that makes this job feel like a calling.\n\n",

She's always been supportive of my growth, whether it's encouraging me to take on new projects or offering guidance when I'm feeling overwhelmed. I feel fortunate that she sees my contributions and trusts me with important responsibilities. As for my coworkers, we have a strong sense of camaraderie. We come from different backgrounds and have different experiences, but we're all united by the common goal of fostering understanding and connection within our community.

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nVictoria Petrov: My work schedule is pretty predictable, though there's some flexibility depending on the needs of the nonprofit. I usually work Monday through Friday, with mornings dedicated to administrative tasks, meetings, and planning, and afternoons spent in the community or with volunteers. The hours are generally from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., but sometimes I stay a bit later if I'm preparing for an event or meeting with a guest speaker. What I appreciate most is that my manager trusts me to manage my time well, so I can often adjust my schedule if needed\u2014whether it's starting a bit later in the morning or finishing up a bit later in the afternoon. This flexibility is especially helpful when I need to attend church services, spend time with my husband, or tend to my garden. It's not a rigid 9-to-5 job, and I think that balance is what makes it sustainable for me.

My part-time job, combined with my husband's income, gives us the freedom to support our community, care for each other, and maintain a sense of peace in our daily lives.

She believed that education was a way to open doors, and she passed that belief on to me.

He was responsible for everything from basic car repairs to more complex engine work, and he often took on extra projects to help neighbors out. The business was run by a few local mechanics, and while it wasn't lucrative, it provided steady work and a sense of purpose. My mother, on the other hand, worked at a public school where she taught literature to high school students. She was passionate about her work and often stayed after class to help students with their essays or discuss books that inspired her. Even though she eventually left the classroom to focus more on our family, she never stopped believing in the power of education.
