    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nLily Hanson: Well, I was born in Des Moines, Iowa, and I've lived here my whole life, which is pretty rare these days. I grew up in a small house on Cedar Avenue, the same one I still live in now. My parents are both college-educated, which was pretty common in our neighborhood back then. My dad worked in finance, and my mom was a teacher, so I was always surrounded by books and numbers. I remember my mom reading to me every night before bed, and my dad helping me with math problems even when I was in elementary school. I was a pretty quiet kid, more of an observer than someone who sought out attention. I loved art and music, especially classical music. I played the piano for a few years, but I never really pursued it seriously. I went to college right after high school, got my bachelor's degree in business administration, which was a bit of a surprise to my parents because they thought I might go into education or something more stable. But I wanted to try something different. I worked part-time during college, mostly at a local bookstore, which was a great experience. After graduation, I landed a job at a small marketing firm here in Des Moines, but I've been on medical leave for the past few weeks due to a minor surgery. It's been a bit of a disruption, but I'm grateful for the time to rest and reflect. I'm not sure where life is headed next, but I like to think I'm still figuring things out, one step at a time.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nLily Hanson: I think the crossroads moment for me was right after I graduated from college. I had a few options: I could have stayed in Des Moines and taken a more traditional path, like working for a local bank or maybe even teaching, given my mom's influence. But I also had the opportunity to move to Chicago for an internship at a larger marketing firm. It was a big decision because I had never been far from home, and I was afraid of leaving everything familiar. I remember sitting at my kitchen table, staring at the application for the internship, and feeling this mix of excitement and fear. I talked it over with my parents, and they were supportive but also worried about me being so far from home. In the end, I decided to take the leap. That internship turned into a full-time job, and it opened my eyes to so many possibilities I hadn't even considered. It also made me realize how much I missed the close-knit community here in Des Moines. I came back after a year, and that experience shaped the way I approach my work and life now. It taught me that growth often happens outside of your comfort zone, but it also made me appreciate the stability and support of home even more.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nLily Hanson: I think for me, it was a conscious choice, even if it felt a little uncertain at the time. I remember weighing the pros and cons for weeks, talking it through with friends, and even writing down my fears and hopes on a piece of paper. I didn't want to make a decision based on fear, but I also didn't want to regret not taking a chance. In the end, I chose the path that felt like it would challenge me the most, even if it was scary. I think that's what makes a choice 'conscious'\u2014you're aware of the risks and the rewards, and you're willing to own the outcome, whether it works out or not. I don't think anything just 'happens' without some level of intention, even if it's not fully formed at first.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Do you think another person or an organization could have lent a helping hand during moments like this?\n\nLily Hanson: Absolutely, I think having someone to talk to during that time would have made a big difference. My mom was incredibly supportive, but she was also worried about me moving so far away. I remember talking to a mentor from my college marketing class, someone who had worked in Chicago and had taken similar risks. He shared his own story of leaving home for an opportunity and how it changed his life. That conversation really helped me see that taking a chance wasn't just about leaving home\u2014it was about growing into the person I wanted to be. I also think organizations like the local chamber of commerce or even my university's career center could have provided more resources or connections for someone in my position. It's funny, though, because I didn't realize how much I was relying on others until after I made the decision. It's a reminder that even when we feel like we're making choices on our own, we're often standing on the shoulders of those who've supported us along the way.\n\n",

I've always been the type to focus on my own growth before jumping into a relationship or starting a family. My parents are still very much a part of my life, and I see them often. My mom still teaches part-time, and my dad is retired now but keeps himself busy with community projects. We have a close relationship, and I think that's one of the reasons I feel so grounded here in Des Moines. I do have a few close friends from college who I stay in touch with, and we often get together for coffee or dinner. I wouldn't say I'm lonely, but I also don't feel any pressure to be in a relationship right now. I think I'm in one of those phases where I'm just enjoying the quiet of my own life, focusing on my health after the surgery, and maybe even thinking about going back to school for a master's degree in marketing.

We have a close-knit relationship, and I think that's one of the reasons I feel so grounded here in Des Moines. My brother, Ethan, actually, he's a few years younger than me. He's in his early twenties now and is studying engineering at Iowa State. We don't see each other as often as I'd like, but we keep in touch through texts and occasional visits. He's always been the more adventurous one, so I guess that's why he ended up leaving for college, while I stayed closer to home. Our relationship has always been a bit competitive, but in a good way. He pushes me to be more ambitious, and I, in turn, remind him to take a step back and enjoy life sometimes. I think that's why I'm still considering going back to school\u2014it's something we both talk about, but he's already on his path, and I want to find my own.\n\n",

There's Sarah, who was my roommate, and she's now a graphic designer in Minneapolis. We used to talk about art and music all the time, and even though we're not as close as we once were, I still value her opinion. Then there's Mark, who was in my marketing class, and he ended up working in Chicago, which is where I went for that internship. We stayed in touch, and he was actually the one who encouraged me to take that leap. He's always been more of a risk-taker than I am, so I think that's why he pushed me. I also have a few coworkers from my current job who I consider friends, though our relationship is more professional. I think what's important to me in friends is someone who listens and doesn't judge, someone who can be there even when life gets complicated. I don't have a romantic partner right now, but I do think about what that might look like in the future. For now, I'm content with the people I have in my life and the support they've given me.\n\n",

It's one of those places where everyone knows each other, and there's a real sense of community. My house is a bit old, with a small front yard and a porch where I like to sit in the evenings with a cup of coffee. There's a park nearby where I used to take long walks, especially when I was feeling overwhelmed with work or decisions. The neighborhood has changed a little over the years\u2014more new businesses have opened up, and there's a bit more diversity now than when I was a kid. But the feeling of home has stayed the same.

I remember when I was younger, I used to walk home from school alone, and I never worried about it. Even now, with the changes in the area, I still feel like I can leave my door unlocked if I'm home alone, which is something I wouldn't feel comfortable doing in a bigger city. There's also a local community watch group that meets occasionally, and I think that helps keep things peaceful. I know safety isn't just about not being afraid\u2014it's about feeling like you belong and that your community has your back. That's something I've always felt here, and I think that's why I've never considered moving away, even when I had the chance.\n\n",

The biggest upside is the sense of community and the pace of life. I don't have to rush through my day, and I can take time to enjoy the little things\u2014like the smell of fresh bread from the bakery down the street or the way the sun sets over the park.

On workdays, I usually wake up around 7:30 or 8, have a quiet breakfast, and then spend the morning catching up on emails or working on projects from home.

On one hand, living in a place like Des Moines makes it easier because there's a sense of safety and stability that allows me to focus on my own well-being without the added stress of a fast-paced or unpredictable environment. I can walk outside without worrying about pollution or traffic, and I have access to basic healthcare services. But on the other hand, the slower pace can sometimes make it harder to stay motivated. Without the structure of a traditional job or routine, it's easy to fall into habits that aren't the healthiest\u2014like skipping meals or not getting enough movement. I think the hardest part is reminding myself that health is a daily practice, not just something I do when I feel like it.

It was a minor procedure, but it was unexpected and caught me off guard. I had been experiencing some discomfort for a while, but I didn't think it was serious enough to seek medical attention right away. Looking back, I probably waited too long, and that's something I've been reflecting on since then. The surgery itself was straightforward, but the recovery has been a bit slower than I anticipated.

I missed the routine, and I also missed the sense of control that came with being able to move freely. But looking back, I think it was a necessary pause. It gave me time to reflect on my life in a way I hadn't really done in a while. I wasn't working full-time, so I had more time to think about what I wanted next\u2014whether it was going back to school, exploring new opportunities, or just taking a different approach to my work. In some ways, it was challenging, but it also opened up a space for growth that I might not have had otherwise. I don't think I would have considered making some of the changes I'm thinking about now if I hadn't had that time to step back and really listen to what my body and my mind needed.\n\n",

Tell me all about how you have been feeling.\n\nLily Hanson: Over the past year, I've been going through a lot of reflection, especially after the surgery and the time off work. It's been a bit of a quiet year, but in a way, that's been a gift. I've had more time to think about where I want to go next, both personally and professionally. I've been reevaluating my goals, and it's interesting how much I've changed since I was younger. I used to think that having a stable job and a steady life was the ultimate goal, but now I see that growth comes from being open to change and new experiences. I've also been reconnecting with parts of myself that I might have neglected\u2014like my love for music and art. I've started taking piano lessons again, something I hadn't done in years, and it's been a really fulfilling way to spend my time. I think the past year has been about slowing down and really listening to what I need, rather than just pushing forward. It's not always easy, but I feel like I'm finally in a place where I can make choices that are truly mine, without the pressure of expectations from others.\n\n",

I used to think of health as something I could take for granted, but now I see it as a daily practice\u2014one that requires intention and consistency. Incorporating mindfulness, like meditation and journaling, has been a small but meaningful shift for me. It's helped me feel more present and less overwhelmed by the uncertainty of where I'm headed. At the same time, I've realized how much my environment plays a role in my well-being. Living in Des Moines, with its sense of safety and community, makes it easier to focus on health without the added stress of a fast-paced city life. But I also know that without structure, it's easy to slip into unhealthy habits. I'm learning to be kinder to myself, to show up for my health even on the days when I don't feel like it. It's not about perfection\u2014it's about showing up, again and again, and that's something I'm trying to make a priority moving forward.",

How about for you?\n\nLily Hanson: I think I've definitely struggled with anxiety at times, especially during the periods when I felt stuck or uncertain about my future. There were moments when I would lie awake at night, worrying about whether I was making the right choices or if I was going to be enough in whatever path I chose. But I've come to see that anxiety isn't always a bad thing\u2014it can be a signal that I need to pay attention to something in my life. I've started using mindfulness and journaling as tools to help manage it, and I've also been talking to a therapist occasionally, which has been really helpful. I don't think I would have recognized the signs of anxiety before, but now I understand it better.

My parents have always been there for me, but I could tell they were worried about me not being as active as I used to be. My mom, in particular, has been checking in on me more often, making sure I'm eating and taking my medication. She's the kind of person who wants to fix everything, so she's been trying to help me stay on track with my recovery and even suggested I take up some of the hobbies I used to enjoy, like painting or playing the piano. My dad, on the other hand, has been more about giving me space to figure things out on my own, which I really appreciate. He always says, 'You've got this, Lily,' and that kind of reassurance has meant a lot to me. My brother, Ethan, has been supportive too, even though he's been busy with his studies. He sent me a care package with some of my favorite snacks and a few books I've been meaning to read.

I was raised Catholic, and I still go to church every Sunday, mostly because it's a tradition I've always known and because it gives me a sense of community. I don't think of it as something I need to believe in deeply to feel connected, but I do find comfort in the rituals\u2014the prayers, the hymns, the quiet moments of reflection. It's not about doctrine for me; it's more about the way it helps me feel grounded, especially during times when life feels uncertain. I've always believed in something bigger than myself, even if I can't always put it into words. I think that's what spirituality means to me now\u2014more of a feeling than a set of beliefs.

I've always been more of a private person, and I find that platforms like Facebook or Instagram can sometimes feel overwhelming with all the noise and comparison. I do keep in touch with a few friends through Messenger, and I follow some local community pages for events or news, but I don't spend a lot of time scrolling through feeds or updating my own status. I think it's more about staying connected with the people I care about in a meaningful way rather than trying to keep up with the rest of the world.

I've had moments where I felt like I needed to talk to someone, and I would reach out to a friend or family member directly instead of posting something for the world to see. I think there's a difference between sharing your story with someone who truly cares and just putting it out there for validation.

I used to carry a lot of pressure about my future\u2014whether I was making the right choices, whether I was moving forward fast enough. But after the surgery and the time off, I've learned to slow down and be more present. I've started using journaling as a way to process my thoughts, and it's helped me untangle some of the worries I used to carry around. I also find that spending time in nature, like walking in the park or sitting on my porch, helps me feel more grounded. I've been practicing deep breathing exercises when I feel anxious, and it's surprising how much of a difference that makes. I think the biggest change is that I've stopped trying to control everything. I've come to accept that some things are out of my hands, and that's okay.

On top of that, groceries and utilities are pretty consistent\u2014since I live in a small house, my utility bills aren't too bad, but I do try to be mindful of my spending there.

Normally, I spend around $2,500 to $3,000 a month, with the majority going toward rent, groceries, and utilities. Rent is the biggest fixed cost, and since I live in a small house on Cedar Avenue, it's manageable but not insignificant.

In the winter, my heating bill went up a bit, which is normal for an older house like mine. I also had to budget more for my healthcare expenses, especially after the surgery. That was a big shift from my usual spending, and it made me more aware of how unpredictable medical costs can be. On the flip side, during the summer, I spent a little more on groceries because I was trying out new recipes and cooking more at home, which was a nice change of pace.

It's been a year of slowing down, learning to manage my anxiety, and finding new ways to cope with stress\u2014like journaling, breathing exercises, and spending time in nature. I've come to accept that some things are out of my control, and that's okay. At the same time, I've realized how important it is to have a support system, whether it's my family, my faith, or even the small ways I connect with others. Financially, I've had to be more mindful of my expenses, especially with the unexpected costs of my surgery and recovery, but I've also learned that saving, even in small ways, gives me a sense of security. It's not always easy to navigate life's uncertainties, but I feel more equipped now than I did before to handle whatever comes next\u2014with patience, intention, and the support of those who care about me.",

But I'd estimate that my income last month was around $2,000 to $2,500, depending on the projects I had completed. That's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover my basic needs, especially since I'm still living at home with my parents and not paying full rent. I know it's not the most stable income, which is why I've been thinking more about going back to school. A master's degree could open up more opportunities in the long run, and I think it's something I need to consider seriously. I'm not in a rush, but I do want to build a more secure financial future for myself, even if it takes time.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nLily Hanson: I haven't been at a single workplace for very long in the traditional sense, since my career has been more of a mix of part-time jobs and freelancing. When I was working at the marketing firm, I was there for about two years before I decided to go full-time with freelancing. The benefits of that job were pretty standard\u2014health insurance, a retirement plan, and some paid time off. But honestly, I didn't take full advantage of them at the time. I was more focused on the stability of having a regular paycheck, even if it wasn't the most exciting work. Now that I'm freelancing, I don't have those traditional benefits, which is one of the reasons I've been thinking more about going back to school. I know that with a graduate degree, I might be able to land a position with better benefits or even start my own business with more security. It's not something I take lightly, but I think it's a necessary step if I want to build a more sustainable future for myself.\n\n",

How are your relationships with your coworkers?)\n\nLily Hanson: My relationships at work have varied depending on the job, but I'd say they've been mostly positive and supportive. When I was at the marketing firm, I had a manager who was pretty hands-off but always available if I needed guidance. I appreciated that she gave me the space to be creative while still holding me accountable for results. The coworkers were friendly, and we often had lunch breaks together or chatted about our weekend plans. I think the biggest challenge was that the work environment was pretty fast-paced, and sometimes it felt like everyone was focused on their own tasks rather than collaborating much. That's one of the reasons I gravitated toward freelancing\u2014it gives me more control over my projects and the people I work with. I prefer working with clients who are open to communication and collaboration, even if it means spending more time on the phone or through email. I think the key to any good work relationship is mutual respect and clear expectations, and I try to bring that to every project I take on.\n\n",

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nLily Hanson: My work schedule is pretty flexible, which is both a blessing and a bit of a challenge. As a freelance marketing consultant, I don't have a set 9-to-5 schedule, and that gives me the freedom to work when I feel most productive. Some days, I might start early in the morning, around 8 or 9, and work in short bursts with breaks in between. Other days, I might not start until mid-morning, especially if I'm still recovering or just need a little more time to get into the right headspace. I also have the option to work from home, which is something I really appreciate, especially after my surgery. That said, the flexibility can sometimes make it hard to stay disciplined, especially when I'm not in the flow of work. I've been trying to set a routine for myself, even when I'm not working, just to keep my mind sharp and my habits consistent. It's not always easy, but I think it's a necessary part of balancing my work with my health and personal goals.\n\n",

I know I'm not in a position of wealth, but I also don't feel the constant pressure that comes with financial instability. Living at home with my parents has been a huge relief, especially after the surgery and the unexpected medical costs. It's allowed me to focus more on my recovery and less on worrying about rent or bills. That said, I'm aware that this isn't a long-term solution, and I want to build something more secure for myself. I've been thinking a lot about going back to school, not just for the knowledge, but also for the potential of better job opportunities and more stable income. I don't want to be stuck in this cycle of freelance work forever, especially when I know I could be doing more with the right education and experience. It's a bit intimidating to think about taking on more debt, but I also believe that investing in myself is one of the most important things I can do.

His job involved managing client portfolios, analyzing market trends, and advising people on their financial goals. He was pretty detail-oriented and always had a way of breaking down complex ideas into something simple. I remember him coming home with spreadsheets and charts, and I used to sit at the kitchen table and watch him work. He made it seem like something important, but also something that required patience and careful thinking. My mom, on the other hand, was a high school teacher\u2014specifically, she taught English. She had a way of making literature come alive, and I think that's why I always loved reading. Her most important duties were planning lessons, grading papers, and helping students find their voices through writing. She also stayed involved in the school community, organizing events and mentoring new teachers.
