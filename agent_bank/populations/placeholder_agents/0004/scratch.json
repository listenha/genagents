  "agent_profile_summary": "Hannah Zimmerman, a 27-year-old policy analyst in Boulder, Colorado, grew up in a close-knit, educated family that valued learning and community, shaping her commitment to environmental sustainability and social equity. After earning her graduate degree, she chose to deepen her expertise in policy rather than enter the workforce directly, a decision that led her to a fulfilling career with a non-profit focused on environmental issues. She and her husband, who share similar values, are planning to start a family while balancing their professional and personal lives. Hannah remains actively involved in her community, participates in sustainability initiatives, and maintains a structured yet flexible routine that includes exercise, creative hobbies, and time with loved ones. Her life reflects a steady journey toward aligning her work with her values, navigating the challenges of growth, responsibility, and the desire to leave a positive impact on the world."
