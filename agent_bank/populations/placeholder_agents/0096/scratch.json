  "agent_profile_summary": "Kevin O'Connor, a 20-year-old from Birmingham, Alabama, grew up in a modest household where his parents worked hard to make ends meet, and their limited education shaped his determination to pursue higher learning. A pivotal moment came when he chose to leave his full-time job at a supermarket to focus on his education, a decision driven by a desire to break the cycle of financial struggle and provide a better future for his family. Now working full-time at a local bookstore while studying, he balances his responsibilities with a commitment to personal growth, such as maintaining a small herb garden on his balcony and engaging in mindfulness practices to manage stress. His life is defined by a steady push toward stability—working toward a degree, saving for a home, and planning for a future that includes family. Though he navigates the pressures of student life and a tight budget, Kevin remains grounded in the values of resilience and community, often relying on the support of his family and friends to stay focused on his long-term goals."
