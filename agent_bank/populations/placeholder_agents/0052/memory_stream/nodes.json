Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nEmily Davis: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and I've lived here my entire life, though I've moved around within the city a bit. My parents, both high school graduates, were very supportive of my education. My mom worked as a secretary, which kept us afloat financially, even though our income was below average. We always emphasized the importance of doing well in school, and I remember spending many afternoons helping with homework or studying together. I attended a local Catholic school until high school, where I eventually left due to personal beliefs. I'm not religious now, but I used to be Catholic. High school wasn't always easy, but I managed to graduate and got a job right away, working full time since then.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nEmily Davis: There was one particular moment when I felt like I was at a crossroads. In high school, I was offered a scholarship to attend a private university, but it came with a requirement that I join the military after graduation. That was around the same time that I started to question my faith and decided to leave the Catholic church. It was a tough decision because it meant I had to choose between a potentially life-changing opportunity and something that aligned less with my personal values. In the end, I decided to take the scholarship but declined the military requirement. Looking back, that decision really shaped who I am today, as it allowed me to focus on my studies and eventually led me to my current job.\n\n",

They understood and supported my decision, which made things easier. It was a difficult period, but it taught me a lot about myself and what I truly believed in. Since then, I've continued to work hard and stay true to those values.\n\n",

I've been really focused on maintaining a routine and incorporating mindfulness techniques into my daily life. It's helped me manage the stress that comes with my job and the expectations I have for myself. When I do feel stressed, I try to take a step back, breathe deeply, and focus on the present moment.
