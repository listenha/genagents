  "agent_profile_summary": "James Wagner, a 21-year-old software engineer from Charlotte, North Carolina, grew up in a close-knit family that emphasized hard work and responsibility. After graduating high school, he chose to move away for college, a decision that marked a turning point in his life, leading him to a career in tech and a stable job at a mid-sized company where he values collaboration and professional growth. He balances his work with a commitment to personal well-being, regularly attending fitness classes and participating in a book club to stay intellectually and socially engaged. Though he prioritizes his career and maintains strong ties with his family, he also navigates the tension between independence and the desire for deeper personal connections, such as forming a romantic relationship. His life reflects a steady pursuit of stability, self-improvement, and meaningful engagement with both his community and his own evolving sense of purpose."
