    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nBrian Johnson: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and grew up in a modest household. My parents were both working-class folks. My father worked at a factory and eventually earned his bachelor's degree, which helped him get a better job later on. My mother stayed home most of the time but did work part-time as a secretary when I was younger. We lived in a small house in East Cleveland, which is part of the East North Central region. Despite our modest means, my parents always made sure we had what we needed, even if it meant making sacrifices themselves.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nBrian Johnson: One such moment came during high school when I was faced with the decision of whether to stay in Cleveland or go to college elsewhere. I had always dreamed of exploring different parts of the country, but staying close to home felt right too. My parents wanted me to stay near them, while my friends were encouraging me to branch out and experience new things. After much contemplation, I decided to attend a community college in Cleveland, close enough to visit home often but still allowing me to grow and learn outside my comfort zone. This choice led me to meet new people, take on different challenges, and develop a more open-minded perspective.\n\n",

Ultimately, I believe that my choice was a blend of my own aspirations and the guidance I received from those around me.\n\n",

Rent takes up about half of my income, which is around $1,500. Groceries are pretty consistent, costing me about $300 a month. I try to budget for transportation too, which includes public transit passes and occasional rideshare services. Other expenses include my student loan payments, which are about $200, and my utilities, which are around $100. It's a tight budget, but I manage to save a little each month, which feels good.\n\n",
