  "agent_profile_summary": "Brian Johnson, a 22-year-old from Cleveland, Ohio, grew up in a working-class family and now balances part-time work at a local bookstore with community college classes, all while living in the same city he's called home since childhood. A key decision in his life came during high school, when he chose to attend a local community college instead of leaving for a distant university, a choice that allowed him to stay close to his family while still pushing beyond his comfort zone. He values close relationships deeply, maintaining strong ties with his parents and two older sisters, and regularly volunteers at a library to give back to his community. His life is shaped by a steady push toward financial stability and personal growth, as he works to build an emergency fund and plans for a future that includes homeownership and possibly starting a family. Grounded in routine and supported by family and friends, Brian approaches life with a pragmatic optimism, always balancing the need for stability with a desire to grow and explore."
