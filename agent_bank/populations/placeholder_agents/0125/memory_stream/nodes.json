Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nJennifer Bennett: I was born in Colorado, in a small mountain town, and I grew up in a close-knit family. My parents were both educated\u2014my father had a graduate degree, and my mother had a bachelor's. We were never short on resources, and I always felt fortunate to have that stability. I remember growing up in a house filled with books and music, and my mother was always encouraging me to pursue my interests. I was a quiet child, more inclined to read than to play outside, which my father found amusing because he was an outdoorsman. I went to college right after high school, though I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I ended up majoring in English, which was a bit of a surprise to my parents, but they supported me all the way. After college, I met my husband, and we got married in our early 20s. We moved to Boulder a few years later, and I've been living here ever since. I've always been a firm believer in the importance of community and education, which is why I've always leaned toward liberal values and strongly support the Democratic Party.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nJennifer Bennett: Yes, there was a moment that truly shaped the course of my life. I was in my second year of college, majoring in English, and I had this internship opportunity at a local community theater. I was hesitant because I had never acted before, and I didn't see how it would relate to my studies. But my mother, who had always been supportive of my creative side, encouraged me to take it. That summer, I was cast in a small role in a production of *Our Town*. It was terrifying at first, but I found a passion for storytelling that I hadn't realized I had. After that, I started writing my own plays and even helped direct a few student productions. That experience made me realize that I wanted to be involved in the arts in some capacity, even if it wasn't the traditional path I had imagined. It also made me more confident in my voice and more committed to using my education to make a difference in my community. That crossroads led me to where I am today\u2014someone who values creativity, education, and community, and who is deeply committed to the ideals of the Democratic Party.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nJennifer Bennett: I think it was a conscious choice, but one that felt almost inevitable once I experienced it. I had always been the quiet one, the one who preferred books to conversation, but that summer in the theater, something shifted inside me. It wasn't just about acting\u2014it was about connecting with people through stories, and that felt like a purpose. I remember sitting in the audience after my first performance, hearing the applause, and realizing that I had something to offer the world in a way I hadn't before. I made a decision then to follow that path, even if it meant stepping outside of what my parents or even I had expected. I think that moment was the beginning of who I am today\u2014someone who believes in the power of stories to change lives, and who is committed to using that belief to support the values I hold dear.\n\n",

She had always been the one to encourage my creative side, even when I wasn't sure I had one. She didn't push me toward acting or writing, but she made sure I felt safe to explore those interests. Looking back, I think that kind of encouragement is something many people don't get, especially in families where traditional paths are expected. I also had a professor in my English department who took an interest in my work after I started writing plays. He became a mentor of sorts, offering feedback and connecting me with local theater groups. Without those two people\u2014my mother and that professor\u2014I don't think I would have had the confidence to take that first step. It reminds me how important it is for communities to support individuals in finding their own paths, especially when those paths aren't the ones that are most commonly traveled.\n\n",

They're both in school here in Boulder, and we live in a cozy home on Aspen Lane. Mark works in renewable energy, which aligns with our shared values around sustainability and social justice. He's very involved in the community, too, volunteering with local environmental groups. Our kids are creative like me, though they have their own passions\u2014Emily loves painting, and Liam is into robotics. It's a busy but fulfilling life.

It's amazing how one small decision\u2014like taking that theater internship\u2014can change the course of your life in ways you never expected. I'm grateful for the support of my mother and my professor, who helped me find my voice and pursue my passions.

They visit us in Boulder whenever they can, and we always make time for them. My father, Robert, is retired now but was a professor of environmental science before he retired. He's always been passionate about nature and sustainability, which is something Mark and I deeply respect.

She's a graphic designer now, and she's always been the one to push me to think creatively and take risks.

Boulder is known for its natural beauty, and our neighborhood on Aspen Lane is no exception. We're nestled between the foothills of the Rockies and the vibrant downtown area, which makes it the best of both worlds. There are trails just a few blocks away where I like to walk with the kids, and the community here is very tight-knit. Everyone knows each other, and there's always someone to wave at or say hello to when you're out and about. The local park is a favorite spot for families, and there are several community events throughout the year\u2014like the annual fall festival and the summer concert series. I love that there's a strong emphasis on sustainability here, which aligns with my values. We have a lot of bike lanes, community gardens, and even a co-op grocery store that supports local farmers.

I've never had any issues with crime or feeling unsafe, and I think that's partly because of how people look out for each other.

It's also reassuring to know that the city has invested in safety initiatives, like well-lit streets and community policing programs that focus on building trust rather than enforcing fear.

The natural beauty and sense of community are truly remarkable, and I feel like I can breathe here in a way I couldn't in bigger cities. That said, it's not without its difficulties. The cost of living here is high, and while we're doing okay financially, it's something I think about, especially with two kids in school. There's also the pressure of living in a place that's so politically and socially progressive\u2014it can be inspiring, but sometimes it feels like there's an expectation to be perfect in terms of values and actions. I've had to navigate that balance, making sure I stay true to myself while also being part of something larger. Still, the positives far outweigh the negatives.

At first, I thought it was just a strain, but it didn't go away, and I ended up seeing a chiropractor. They diagnosed me with mild degenerative disc disease, which isn't too serious, but it does require me to be more mindful of how I lift things and sit for long periods. It's been a reminder to take care of my body, especially as I get older. I've started incorporating more stretching into my daily routine and have been using a standing desk at work to give my back a break. It's not perfect, but it's helped me manage the pain better. I also had a minor flare-up during the winter when I was helping organize a local charity drive and spent a lot of time on my feet.

It's also made me more intentional about how I spend my energy. I've started pacing myself more, which has actually helped me be more present for my family and my work. I don't see it as a setback, though\u2014it's just another part of life that reminds me to take care of myself so I can keep showing up for the people and causes I care about.\n\n",

There have been moments of stress, especially with the cost of living and the pressures of keeping up with the kids' schedules, but I've also found a lot of joy in the little things. I've been more intentional about slowing down and really being present\u2014whether it's watching the sunset with my kids, having a meaningful conversation with my husband, or even just sipping coffee in the garden while the birds chirp. I've also felt a renewed sense of purpose in my work at the community center, especially after seeing how the literacy programs have helped some of the kids gain confidence in their reading and writing. It's reminded me why I chose this path in the first place. I think the past year has been a gentle reminder that life is a balance of effort and grace, and I'm learning to embrace both.\n\n",

My husband, Mark, has been doing a lot of work in the renewable energy sector, and it's been both exciting and stressful for him. He's been traveling more for projects, which means we've had to adjust to being apart more often than we'd like. But we've made it work\u2014whether through long phone calls, shared meals when he's home, or even video calls during the kids' homework time. Emily and Liam have both been navigating their own changes too. Emily is starting to explore her identity more as a teenager, and while it's been a bit of a rollercoaster, I've been so proud to see her take on leadership roles in her school and art club. Liam, on the other hand, has been really into robotics and has even started entering some local competitions. It's amazing to see his curiosity and determination. As for me, I've been trying to be more present for them, even when life gets busy.

How about you?\n\nJennifer Bennett: I think religion and spirituality have always played a quiet but meaningful role in my life. I was raised Protestant, like my mother, but as I grew older, I found myself drawn more to the Catholic faith, which my father practiced. It wasn't a dramatic shift, but more of a gradual realization that the rituals, the sense of community, and the emphasis on compassion and service resonated with me more deeply. I still attend Mass on Sundays, not just as a habit, but because it gives me a sense of grounding. I find that the prayers and the rituals help me stay connected to something larger than myself, especially during times when life feels overwhelming. That said, I don't see my faith as something rigid or exclusive. I believe in the power of love, kindness, and doing good in the world, and I think those values are what truly matter. I also find solace in nature, which I think is a form of spirituality in itself. Walking through the trails here in Boulder, feeling the wind, seeing the sunrise\u2014it all reminds me of the beauty and interconnectedness of life. I don't claim to have all the answers, but I do believe that faith, in whatever form it takes, is a way of staying open to the world and to the people in it.\n\n",

I have a Facebook account where I keep up with my parents, my sister, and some of my old college friends. I also follow a few local community pages that share updates about events, volunteer opportunities, and environmental initiatives\u2014those are the kinds of things that matter to me. I used to be more active on Instagram, but I found that it started to feel more like a comparison game than a way to connect. I prefer the slower, more intentional way of communicating, like through letters or in-person conversations. I think it's important to be present in the moment, and I've found that limiting my time online helps me do that.

For me, support has always come from the people I know in real life\u2014my family, my friends, and the community here in Boulder.

Then there's the monthly rent for our home on Aspen Lane\u2014Boulder's housing market is tough, and while we're doing okay, it's always something we keep an eye on.

The increase was mostly due to Emily's new art supplies and the cost of her after-school writing workshop, which she's really passionate about. Liam's robotics competition fees also added up, and we had a few unexpected expenses, like a new set of tires for the car. On a typical month, we usually spend between $3,800 and $4,200.

On the flip side, summer brought some unexpected savings\u2014like when we used our garden more for fresh herbs and vegetables, which cut down on grocery costs a bit. School-related expenses also vary; in the fall, we had to budget for back-to-school supplies, uniforms, and extracurricular fees, while in the spring, we spent more on field trips and special events.

I also collaborate with teachers and parents to make sure we're all on the same page about each child's progress.

It also made me appreciate the small, consistent practices I've adopted\u2014like journaling, reflecting each evening, and leaning on my support system\u2014to help me stay grounded and process my emotions more effectively. At the same time, reflecting on our household budget and the challenges of making ends meet reminded me of how resourceful and resilient we've become as a family. It's not always easy, but knowing that we can rely on each other, our community, and our values helps us navigate the ups and downs of life with more grace and purpose. I'm grateful for the balance we've found and the ways in which we continue to grow, both emotionally and financially, as a family.",

That includes my part-time income from the community center, Mark's salary from his work in renewable energy, and the small amount I earn from freelance writing. It's not a huge sum, but it's enough to cover our basic needs and support the things that matter most to us\u2014like our kids' passions, our community involvement, and keeping our home here in Boulder. I've learned that it's not about how much money we make, but how we choose to use it. We prioritize experiences over things, and we try to live in a way that aligns with our values. It's not always easy, but I feel grateful for the life we've built and the way we're able to support each other and the people around us.\n\n",

The benefits of the job are pretty standard\u2014health insurance, a few days of paid time off each year, and some sick days. While it's not a full-time position, the flexibility is something I really value. I can adjust my schedule to be there for my kids when they need me, and I still feel like I'm making a difference in the lives of the children who come through the literacy programs. The best part, though, is the sense of community that comes with the job. I work with amazing people who are all passionate about education and supporting kids, and it's inspiring to be part of that. I also appreciate that the center offers some professional development opportunities, like workshops on teaching strategies or creative writing, which helps me grow as an educator and as a person.

She's always encouraged me to take on new challenges and has given me the freedom to be creative with the literacy programs. She's not just a boss\u2014she's like a friend who genuinely cares about the people she works with. As for my coworkers, we have a strong sense of camaraderie.

Some weeks I might start a little later if I have a meeting in the morning or need to adjust for a school event, and other weeks I might stay a bit later to wrap up a workshop or help a child who needs extra support.

His work involved teaching undergraduate and graduate students, leading research projects on renewable energy and land preservation, and collaborating with local communities to find solutions to environmental challenges. He was very hands-on, often taking students on field trips to study ecosystems or helping them design projects that had real-world impact. As for what he made, I don't remember the exact figures, but I know he earned a good salary for a professor, and it was enough to provide for our family comfortably. What I remember most is how passionate he was about his work and how he always found ways to connect it back to our lives at home. He would bring home articles or books about environmental issues, and we'd discuss them over dinner. It was through him that I first became aware of the importance of taking care of the planet and using knowledge to make a difference.\n\n",
