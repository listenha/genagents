  "agent_profile_summary": "Jennifer Bennett, a 40-year-old resident of Boulder, Colorado, grew up in a close-knit family in a mountain town, where her parents’ education and support fostered her love for learning and creativity. A pivotal moment came during her second year of college when she took a theater internship, leading her to discover a passion for storytelling that reshaped her path from English major to community arts advocate. Now a mother of two, she balances part-time work at a local community center, where she runs literacy programs, with her family life and ongoing involvement in the arts. Her commitment to education and community is evident in her efforts to support her children’s creative pursuits and her active participation in neighborhood events. Jennifer’s life reflects a steady dedication to connection, creativity, and sustainability, shaped by her upbringing and the values she continues to pass on."
