Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nCynthia Williams: I was born and raised in Columbia, South Carolina, in a tight-knit neighborhood where everyone knew each other. My parents worked hard to provide for our family, and though we didn't have a lot of money, we always made do. I grew up with my two younger siblings, and we were close-knit. My father worked at a local factory, and my mother was a part-time clerk at a grocery store. Both of them only made it through high school, but they always encouraged me and my siblings to keep learning. I was a pretty quiet kid, always more interested in books and music than in sports or parties. I had a few friends, but I was more of an introvert. I remember walking to school every day with my backpack on my shoulder, listening to my headphones and dreaming about what I wanted to be when I grew up. I didn't have a lot of money, but I had a lot of love and support from my family. I graduated high school and started working part-time at a local bookstore to help out with expenses. I'm still figuring out what I want to do with my life, but I know I want to make something of myself, no matter how long it takes.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nCynthia Williams: There was a moment like that, actually. It happened right after I graduated high school. I had a few options in front of me, but none of them felt quite right. I could have gone to community college, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to commit to that yet. I could have taken a job full-time at the bookstore where I was working part-time, but I felt like I was just putting off the future. And then there was the option of taking a gap year, traveling, or doing something else to figure myself out. I remember sitting on my bedroom floor, surrounded by old notebooks and college brochures, feeling completely lost. I didn't know if I wanted to be a teacher, a writer, or even something else entirely. My parents didn't push me in any particular direction, but they did tell me, 'Whatever you choose, just don't stop learning.' That stuck with me. In the end, I decided to take a gap year, not to travel, but to work part-time and save up for community college. That decision taught me a lot about responsibility and patience. It also gave me time to reflect on what I truly wanted. I still don't have all the answers, but I feel like I'm on the right path now.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nCynthia Williams: I think it was a mix of both, honestly. I didn't just fall into a decision, but I also didn't force myself into one either. It felt like the right time to take a step back and not rush into something just because I thought I should. I remember talking to my mom one night, and she said something like, 'You don't have to have everything figured out right now. Just keep moving forward, even if it's one step at a time.' That really stuck with me. I didn't make a grand, dramatic choice, but I made a choice that felt responsible and thoughtful. I think that's what makes it real \u2014 not a sudden epiphany, but a quiet moment of clarity that builds over time.\n\n",

I think if I had talked to someone who could help me see things from a different perspective, it might have made the decision easier. I remember thinking about talking to a counselor at the community center, but I was too shy to ask for help. I didn't want to bother anyone or seem like I wasn't capable of figuring things out on my own. But in hindsight, I think having someone to bounce ideas off of \u2014 even just for a few minutes \u2014 could have made a difference. I know a lot of people my age are dealing with similar things, and I wish there was more support out there for kids like me who aren't sure what they want to do next.

My oldest brother is in the military, and he's been away for a few years now, but we talk often on the phone. My sister is in college, and she's the one who encouraged me to think about going back to school eventually. My parents are still living in the same house we grew up in, and even though they're getting older, they're doing okay. I visit them as much as I can, especially on weekends. I don't see myself getting married anytime soon, and I'm not sure if I want kids, but I know my family will always be there for me.

One of them is Aisha, who I met in high school. She was one of the few people who really understood me, even when I was quiet and reserved. We used to hang out at the library or just sit on the steps of the school and talk about music, books, and our dreams. She was the one who encouraged me to try writing, and she still reads my stuff whenever I send it her way. She's in nursing school now, and though we don't see each other as much as we used to, I know I can always count on her. Then there's my coworker, Jamal, who works at the bookstore with me. He's been a good friend and a sounding board for me, especially during the time I was trying to figure out what to do after high school. He's the one who first suggested taking a gap year, and I'm grateful for that.

It's a mix of old and new \u2014 some of the houses are decades old, with peeling paint and front porches where neighbors used to sit and chat, but there are also newer apartment buildings going up, especially near the downtown area. The streets aren't always the safest, especially at night, but there's a real sense of community here. People know each other, and if you're in trouble, someone will usually look out for you. The local park is a big part of the neighborhood \u2014 it's where kids play, where people walk their dogs, and where I used to sit and read when I was younger. I like that it's not too far from everything \u2014 the bookstore where I work, the community center where I used to go for free classes, and even the bus stop that takes me to the college if I decide to go back. It's not glamorous, but it's home, and I feel like I belong here, even if I'm still figuring out what that means for my future.\n\n",

The neighborhood has its challenges, but it's also where I've always felt connected to people. I know most of my neighbors by name, and they know me too.

I know which streets are quieter, which stores are friendly, and which corners to avoid if I'm out late. There's a rhythm to life here that I've grown used to \u2014 the sound of kids laughing in the park, the smell of barbecue from the corner shop, the way the sun sets over the old church on the hill. But it's not all easy. Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle, working the same job, going to the same places, not sure if I'm making progress or just staying in one place. I guess that's part of what makes me want to go back to school someday. I want to break out of that cycle, not just for myself, but for my family too.

At first, I just ignored it, thinking it would go away on its own. But then it started getting worse, especially after long days. I finally went to the clinic, and the doctor said it was probably from poor posture and muscle strain. He gave me some exercises and told me to take it easy for a while. That was a wake-up call for me \u2014 I realized I hadn't been taking care of my body like I should have. I started stretching more, and I even bought a small foam roller to use at home.

I had to stop and sit down for a while, and that was the first time I realized how much I was pushing myself without really thinking about it. I don't want to be in a position where I can't support my family or myself because I ignored my body's signals. That's why I've been trying to make small changes \u2014 like taking more breaks at work, stretching more, and even looking into some physical therapy classes at the community center. I know it's not a quick fix, but I'm learning that taking care of myself isn't just about being healthy \u2014 it's about being there for the people I love and the future I want to build.\n\n",

There's been a sense of progress, like when I started taking those online classes and going to the community center more often. It feels like I'm finally doing something to move forward, even if it's not as fast as I'd like. But there are also days when I feel stuck, like I'm just going through the motions, working the same job, walking the same streets, and not really changing anything. I think part of it is the weight of knowing I want more for myself and my family, but not knowing exactly how to get there. I've been trying to be more patient with myself, though. I used to think I had to have everything figured out before I could take a step, but now I'm realizing that it's okay to take small steps and not know where they'll lead. I'm still learning, still growing, and I think that's what matters most \u2014 not how fast I'm moving, but that I'm moving at all.\n\n",

There were times when I felt like I was carrying the weight of everything \u2014 my family's expectations, my own uncertainty about the future, and the pressure to do something with my life. I used to feel like I was always on the edge of something, like I was waiting for the right moment to make a move, but I never knew when that moment would come. I remember lying awake at night, thinking about all the possibilities and all the things I wasn't sure about. It wasn't a constant feeling, but it was there enough to make me feel stuck in my own head. I didn't talk about it much, not even with Aisha or Jamal, because I didn't want to seem like I was giving up or not trying hard enough. But looking back, I think that anxiety was just another part of the journey \u2014 something I had to learn how to live with, not necessarily something I had to get rid of. I'm still learning how to manage it, but I'm starting to see that it doesn't define me. It's just one part of who I am, and I'm trying to be kinder to myself when it shows up.\n\n",

My parents have always been there for me, but I can see the way they look at me sometimes \u2014 like they're proud of me for trying, but also worried that I'm not moving fast enough. My mom especially, she's the one who always says, 'You're doing the best you can, and that's all anyone can ask for.' But I know she wants more for me, just like she wanted more for my brother and sister. My dad, he's more laid-back about it, but I can tell he's been watching me closely, waiting to see if I'm going to take that next step. As for my siblings, my sister is the one who's been the most encouraging \u2014 she's in college now, and she keeps reminding me that it's never too late to start something new. My brother, Marcus, he's been busy with work and his own life, but I know he's proud of me in his own way. He always says I'm more like him than I think, and that means a lot. I think what's been hardest for my family is seeing me struggle with uncertainty \u2014 not because they don't believe in me, but because they know how much it means to me to find my own way.

I grew up in a household where my parents didn't really practice any specific faith, and I never really felt the need to fill that space with something else. I think I've always been more of a person who looks for meaning in the everyday \u2014 in the way the sun sets over the old church on the hill, or in the quiet moments I have on my porch with a book. I know some people find comfort in prayer or going to church, and I respect that. But for me, it's more about the people I love, the community I'm part of, and the small steps I take every day to build a better life. I don't think of it as spirituality in the traditional sense, but I do believe in something bigger than myself \u2014 maybe not a god, but the idea that we all have a role to play in making things better for each other.

But I know rent was definitely the biggest part of it, maybe around $600 or so. Groceries probably came in close behind, maybe around $300, depending on what we needed.

That's not unusual for us \u2014 it's pretty much what we spend every month. The thing is, it's not always the same. Sometimes we have to cut back on groceries if one of us is working extra hours or if there's an unexpected bill. Other times, we might spend a little more on something like a new pair of shoes or a special dinner out. But for the most part, we stick to what we can afford, and we make it work.

My aunt lets me stay there for a reduced rate, and in return, I help her out with some chores around the house, like mowing the lawn or doing light cleaning. It's a good arrangement for both of us.

For example, during the winter months, our heating bill tends to be a bit higher, and we usually have to budget a little more for that. Then, around the holidays, we might spend a little more on groceries or small gifts for family, but it's nothing too extravagant. On the flip side, during the summer, we don't use as much electricity for heating, so that part of the bill goes down. I also noticed that when I started taking online classes, I had to pay for some additional fees or materials, which added a little bit to the monthly cost.

I work at the bookstore, I take care of my family when I can, and I try to make time for myself \u2014 even if it's just sitting on my porch with a book or walking through the park. I don't know if I could handle more than that right now. There's something about having too many responsibilities at once that makes me feel like I'm losing myself, and I don't want that. I think it's better to be steady, even if it's not fast \u2014 and for now, that's what I need.\n\n",

When I talked about my budget and how we manage our money, I felt a mix of pride and frustration \u2014 proud of how we make it work, but frustrated by the limitations that come with not having much. I know I can't change everything overnight, but I'm learning that even small steps \u2014 like saving a little each week or cutting back on unnecessary expenses \u2014 can help build a better future. It's not always easy to balance everything, but I'm trying to be kinder to myself and more patient with the process. I'm still figuring it out, but I'm grateful for the people and the small things that keep me moving forward.",

My paycheck is pretty steady \u2014 I make about $12 an hour, and with the hours I work, that adds up to roughly $1,200 a month. My parents still help out with some of the bills, especially when things get tight, but I try not to rely on them too much. I know it's not a lot, but it's enough to keep us going \u2014 and honestly, I think that's what matters most right now.

The benefits aren't anything fancy \u2014 there's no health insurance or paid vacation, just the basics like sick days when I really need them. But what I appreciate most is the flexibility. I can work the hours that fit around my family and my studies, and the manager, Jamal, is pretty understanding when I need to take a break or adjust my schedule. The coworkers are friendly, and even though we don't make a lot of money, there's a real sense of community in the store. We all know each other's names, we share music and stories, and sometimes we even help each other out with things like transportation or groceries. It's not much, but it's enough to make me feel like I belong \u2014 and that, I think, is one of the most important things about any job.\n\n",

Jamal, my manager, is someone I really respect \u2014 he's been there for me since I started, and even though he doesn't always realize it, he's been a mentor in his own way. He's not the kind of person who yells or gives strict orders; he's more like the guy who knows when to give you space and when to push you a little. I think that's why I've stayed at the bookstore for so long \u2014 it's not just about the job, it's about the people. As for my coworkers, we're all pretty laid-back, and we've built this kind of unspoken understanding. We know when to help each other out, whether it's covering a shift or just lending an ear when someone's having a rough day. I don't think any of us make a lot of money, but we all have our own reasons for being there, and I think that shared sense of purpose makes the place feel like home in its own way.\n\n",

I usually work Wednesday through Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and that's been my rhythm for a while now. But if there's a special event, like a poetry night or an author signing, Jamal might ask me to stay a little later or come in on a Monday if things get busy. I also have some say in how I manage my hours \u2014 if I need to leave early for a family commitment or if I'm feeling under the weather, Jamal is usually okay with adjusting my shift as long as I cover it with someone else. It's not perfect, but I think that flexibility is one of the things that keeps me from feeling like I'm stuck in a routine.
