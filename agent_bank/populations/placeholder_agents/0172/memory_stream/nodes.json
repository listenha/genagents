Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nTrent Piatkowski: I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, and grew up in a pretty stable household. My parents were both educated\u2014my dad had a graduate degree, and my mom had a bachelor's. They worked full-time, so we were never short on anything, though we weren't super wealthy. I remember my mom being really involved in our lives, always encouraging us to read and learn. My dad was more laid-back but always supported our education. I was raised as a Protestant, but I haven't been religious since I was a teenager. I went to college right after high school, got my bachelor's degree in something I wasn't super passionate about\u2014maybe business or economics. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, so I just went with what was safe. After college, I worked a few different part-time jobs, mostly in customer service or retail, and I've been doing that for a while now. I never really joined the military, and I've never married or had kids. I'm pretty independent, and I lean slightly liberal, though I don't follow politics too closely. I've moved around a bit since I was 16, but I still call Charlotte home. It's not the most exciting life, but it's been steady and comfortable.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nTrent Piatkowski: Looking back, I think the crossroads came right after I graduated from college. I had this degree in business, but I wasn't really excited about it. I remember sitting in my dorm room, staring at my diploma, and feeling like I had checked a box but not really found my path. I had a few options: I could try to get a job in finance or consulting, which were the typical paths for someone with my degree. Or I could take a risk and try something different, like moving to a different city or even traveling for a while. I was 23 at the time, and I felt like I had this weird pressure to be 'successful' in a traditional sense. But I also felt like I was just going through the motions. In the end, I chose the safe route\u2014got a part-time job at a local bookstore and started working in customer service. It wasn't what I had planned, but it gave me time to figure out what I really wanted. That decision taught me that sometimes the 'safe' choice isn't the wrong one\u2014it just means you have more time to explore other options. I think that's why I ended up staying in Charlotte, because I didn't want to rush into something I wasn't sure about. It was a quiet moment, but it shaped a lot of my decisions after that.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nTrent Piatkowski: I think it was a conscious choice, but not in the way most people might expect. I wasn't making a big, dramatic decision like moving across the country or quitting my job. It was more of a quiet realization that I didn't want to follow the script everyone else seemed to be following. I saw friends who went into finance or corporate jobs, and they were doing well, but I felt like I was watching their lives from the outside. I didn't want to be someone who just went through the motions. So I made the decision to take a step back, to not rush into something just because it was expected of me. It wasn't a sudden epiphany\u2014it was more like a slow shift in how I saw myself and what I wanted. I think that's why I ended up staying in Charlotte, because I wanted to be close to home and have the freedom to explore without pressure. It wasn't a perfect decision, but it felt right at the time.\n\n",

She always encouraged me to think about what made me happy, not just what was practical. I remember one conversation we had after I graduated, where she said something like, 'You don't have to rush into the first thing that comes your way. Sometimes, taking a little time to breathe and figure things out is the best thing you can do.' It wasn't a big speech, but it stuck with me. I don't know if I would have made the choice I did without her nudging me in that direction. I think if I had had more support from people in my life\u2014like a mentor or a counselor\u2014it might have made the transition easier. But I also think I needed that time to be on my own to really understand what I wanted.\n\n",

I do stay in touch with my parents, though\u2014they're both still in Charlotte, and we have dinner together every now and then. My mom still reads a lot, and she's always encouraging me to keep learning, even if it's just through books or online courses. My dad retired a few years ago and now spends a lot of time gardening and volunteering at the local community center. I respect their values and the life they built, but I also want to carve out my own path. I think I'm content with where I am for now, even if it's not the most conventional life story.\n\n",

The questions made me reflect on how my parents influenced me, especially my mom, who always encouraged me to think about what made me happy.

We don't talk as often as I'd like, but when we do, it's always interesting to hear about her life. She's more driven and ambitious than I am, which I admire. I think part of the reason we're not as close anymore is that we've made different choices, but I still respect her for going after what she wanted. She's married now, has a kid, and lives in San Francisco. I visit her every few years, and it's always a reminder of how different paths can lead to completely different lives.

One of them, Jake, is actually in the same part-time job I started with at the bookstore, and we still meet up for coffee sometimes. He's the one who introduced me to a lot of the indie authors and smaller publishers, which ended up sparking my interest in reading more deeply. I also have a couple of coworkers from my current job who I consider good friends\u2014people I can talk to about everything from the latest books to just random thoughts about life. They don't have the same background as I do, which is interesting. One of them is from a different part of the country, and he's always telling me about his hometown and how it's shaped his views on things. It's funny how even in a small, part-time job, you can meet people who challenge you to think differently. I don't know if I'd call any of them family, but they're definitely important to me in their own way.

It's one of those places where you can walk to the local park, the coffee shop, and even the library without needing a car. The streets are lined with old oak trees, which is probably why it's called Oakwood, and there's a real sense of community here. A lot of the people who live here are either long-time residents or people like me who moved here for stability. There's a mix of professionals, retirees, and even some young people who are just starting out. I like that it's not too fast-paced or overly commercialized. My apartment is on the second floor of a small building with a few other units, and I actually enjoy the fact that it's not too big. It's just enough space for me, and I've managed to make it feel like home with a few bookshelves, some plants, and a small kitchen that I use for cooking simple meals. I've never really thought about moving again, mostly because I've come to appreciate the comfort of knowing where I am.

I've never had any issues with my apartment or the people around me. In fact, I've gotten to know a few of my neighbors over the years\u2014some of them are regulars at the local coffee shop, and we've had some good conversations about everything from books to politics. It's not perfect, but there's something comforting about living somewhere where you don't have to lock your doors at night or second-guess your surroundings.

The biggest upside is the sense of stability I mentioned before. I don't have to worry about the daily chaos of a bigger city, and I like knowing that I can walk to most places without feeling overwhelmed. The community here is pretty tight-knit, and I've actually gotten involved in a few local events, like the annual book fair at the library. It's a small thing, but it gives me a sense of purpose and connection. On the downside, I sometimes feel like I'm stuck in a routine. I work part-time, I read, I hang out with friends, and I go to dinner with my parents. It's comfortable, but I wonder if I'm missing out on something more.

I've found that it's been a good way to meet others who share my love for reading, even if it's not the same kind of social interaction I had in college.

The back strain I had a few months ago was more of a minor inconvenience than anything else\u2014it didn't stop me from working or doing the things I needed to do. I think part of that is because I've never been someone who pushes myself too hard or takes on too much at once.

For me, it's more about staying aware of my body and making small adjustments when needed, rather than dealing with anything that would really disrupt my routine.\n\n",

There's something comforting about the rhythm of my life\u2014waking up, working at the bookstore, reading, and seeing my parents for dinner. It's steady, and I think that's what I've come to value most. But there's also this undercurrent of wondering if I'm settling for something less than what I could be. I've been trying to push myself a little more, like with the writing class and the book club, and it's been nice to feel like I'm growing in small ways. I don't know if I'm any closer to figuring out what I really want, but I do feel like I'm more aware of the choices I'm making. It's not dramatic or life-changing, but it's something. I think I'm learning that growth doesn't always have to be loud\u2014it can be quiet, and it can happen in the everyday things you do, like reading a book or writing a few sentences just for yourself.\n\n",

It's interesting how health, for me, isn't about dramatic changes or strict regimens, but about being mindful of the little things that keep me grounded. I've come to appreciate that staying healthy isn't about perfection, but about showing up for myself in small, consistent ways. I also see how my health hasn't really been a barrier in my life, which I think is partly because I've never pushed myself too hard or ignored my body's signals. It's a reminder that sometimes, the most important things in life aren't the big, flashy changes, but the quiet, intentional choices we make every day.",

I've had moments of feeling stuck or unsure about my direction, especially after college, but I've always found ways to push through them. I think part of that is because I've never been someone who dwells too much on the negative. I've always tried to focus on the things that bring me comfort\u2014like reading, walking in the neighborhood, or just having a quiet evening with a book. That said, I've noticed that there are days when I feel more distant from everything, like I'm just going through the motions. But I don't think it's anything that's held me back in a major way.

I respect their values and the life they built, but I also want to carve out my own path. I think I'm content with where I am for now, even if it's not the most conventional life story.

How about you?\n\nTrent Piatkowski: I was raised as a Protestant, but I haven't been religious since I was a teenager. Looking back, I think it was more about the structure and community that church provided than any deep spiritual belief. As I got older, I started to question a lot of the things I was taught, and I found myself more interested in the ideas and philosophies that came from books and conversations than from sermons or scripture. I still respect the values my parents instilled in me through their faith, like kindness and hard work, but I don't think I need organized religion to feel connected to something bigger. For me, spirituality is more about the quiet moments\u2014like sitting in the park reading, or reflecting on a story that really moves me. It's not something I think about every day, but I do believe that there's value in being mindful of the world around you and the people in it.

I've always been more of a person who prefers face-to-face interactions or even just the quiet of a book over scrolling through my phone. I have a Facebook account, mostly to stay in touch with family and a few old friends, but I don't post much or engage with the content too often. I've noticed that the more I use it, the more it feels like it takes away from the time I could be reading or talking to someone in person.

I do follow a few book-related pages or authors I admire, but I don't feel the need to be constantly updated on what's happening in the digital world.

These things don't eliminate stress entirely, but they do give me a sense of purpose and connection that I hadn't really considered before. When I do feel a little overwhelmed, I tend to fall back on the same coping strategies I've always used: reading, walking, or just sitting with a cup of coffee and letting my thoughts settle. I've also started journaling more, which has been a helpful way to process things without overthinking. I think the biggest shift for me has been realizing that I don't need to be constantly striving for something bigger to feel fulfilled. It's not about eliminating worry or stress\u2014it's about learning how to move through it without letting it take over.

I live frugally, which has always been a part of my personality. My biggest expenses are rent, groceries, and utilities. Rent for my apartment is around $1,200 a month, which is manageable since I don't have any other major debts or obligations. Groceries are another big one\u2014especially since I like to cook at home, which I think is healthier and more satisfying than eating out all the time. I also try to buy in bulk or take advantage of sales when I can. Utilities are a bit variable depending on the season, but I've always been careful about not wasting electricity or water. I also set aside a small amount each month for books and other personal interests, which is something I've always valued. I don't have a lot of discretionary spending, but I do make sure I have enough for the things that matter to me\u2014like reading, staying connected with my family, and having a little bit of time for myself.

The rest goes toward things like coffee, a few meals out with friends, and some small expenses here and there. It's not a lot, but it's enough to cover everything I need without feeling like I'm constantly stretching.

Groceries do fluctuate a bit depending on the season\u2014like, I tend to spend a little more in the winter when I'm cooking more at home and less in the summer when I'm eating out with friends more often.

Having a few different roles, even if they're part-time or short-lived, has helped me stay flexible and open to new experiences. It's not about having a traditional career path\u2014it's about finding what works for me and being okay with the fact that it might not look like what other people expect.\n\n",

It's not about grand gestures or dramatic changes, but about finding peace in the everyday things that bring me comfort. I've come to realize that my emotional coping strategies, like reading or walking in the park, are deeply tied to the sense of grounding I've built over the years. I also see now that my financial habits, though simple, are a reflection of the same values: living within my means, prioritizing what truly matters, and not getting caught up in things that don't add value to my life. It's interesting how these small, steady choices have shaped my sense of contentment, even if I sometimes wonder what else could be out there. But I think I've learned that it's okay to be where I am, as long as I'm still growing in the ways that feel right for me.",

It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover my rent, groceries, and other essentials without too much strain. I don't have any other sources of income right now, but I've always been okay with that. I think part of it is that I've never been someone who needs a lot to feel content. I've always valued stability over extravagance, and I've come to appreciate the life I've built without needing more. It's not about not wanting more\u2014it's more about knowing what I need and being satisfied with that. I've also been careful with my spending, which has helped me avoid debt and keep things manageable. I don't know if I'll ever have a higher income, but I don't think I need it to be happy. It's the small things\u2014the books I read, the walks I take, the time I spend with my parents\u2014that make me feel like I'm living a full life, even if it's not the one everyone else is chasing.\n\n",

The benefits of the job aren't the typical ones you hear about in corporate jobs\u2014there's no health insurance or paid vacation days, but there are other things that make it worth it. For one, the flexibility is huge. I can choose my days off based on what I need, which is something I really appreciate. The store also has a great culture\u2014everyone there is passionate about books, and that makes the work feel less like a job and more like being part of a community. We support each other, whether it's helping out during busy seasons or just sharing a good book recommendation. I've also gotten to know a lot of regular customers who have become like friends over the years. They come in with stories, questions, and sometimes even life updates, which makes the job feel more meaningful than I ever expected. It's not perfect, but I think the intangible benefits\u2014the connection, the sense of purpose, and the freedom to live on my own terms\u2014make all the difference.\n\n",

Her name is Linda, and she's been at the bookstore for over 20 years. She's the kind of person who knows everyone by name and has a story for every book on the shelves. She gives me a lot of freedom, which I really appreciate, and she's always been supportive of my small projects, like the writing class I took or the book club I started. As for my coworkers, we've all become pretty close over the years. We joke around, we help each other out, and we've even had some pretty deep conversations about life, books, and what we're looking for in our own paths. It's not a traditional office environment, but there's a real sense of camaraderie and mutual respect.

I usually work the same days each week\u2014Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays\u2014but I can adjust my hours a bit depending on how I'm feeling or if there's something else I need to do. The store manager, Linda, is pretty understanding, so if I need to leave a little early or come in a bit late, she doesn't bat an eye. That flexibility is something I really value because it gives me the freedom to maintain my routine\u2014like reading in the evenings or spending time with my parents on the weekends. I think that's why I've stayed in Charlotte and kept this job for so long. It's not about having a rigid schedule or being tied down to a nine-to-five.

I can afford to rent a place that feels like home, I can buy groceries without stress, and I can still spend time on the things that matter to me\u2014like reading, writing, or just sitting in the park with a book.

My mom worked as a teacher for over 20 years, and my dad was a researcher in a university lab. They both had pretty stable jobs, which gave our family a sense of security. I remember my mom always being busy grading papers or planning lessons, but she made sure to set aside time for us\u2014like reading with me before bed or taking us to the library on the weekends. My dad was more of a quiet presence, but he was always supportive of my education. He even helped me with my math homework sometimes, even though he wasn't a math teacher. I think their work ethic really shaped me, especially my mom's dedication to teaching. She always said that education was the key to opportunities, and I think that's why I ended up going to college right after high school. I don't know if I would have had the same drive without seeing them work so hard and value learning so much. It's funny how the things they did\u2014like staying up late to grade papers or working late nights in the lab\u2014became part of the background of my life, but they definitely left an impression on me.\n\n",

She had a way of making literature feel alive, and I remember how she would bring in stories from her own life to help us understand the ones we were reading. She also ran a small book club for teachers in the district, which I think is where she developed her love for discussing ideas and stories with others. My dad, on the other hand, worked as a research scientist at a university, mostly in the field of environmental studies. His most important duties involved conducting experiments, analyzing data, and publishing papers. He was pretty quiet about his work, but I remember him coming home with stories about the projects he was working on\u2014like how he was studying the impact of climate change on local ecosystems. Both of them had different kinds of work, but they shared a common value: they believed in the power of knowledge and the importance of doing meaningful work, even if it wasn't always glamorous.

My mom's job was pretty much centered around teaching and mentoring students, and she made sure that her work had a real impact on the lives of the kids she taught. She wasn't just there to give grades; she was there to help them think critically, to challenge them, and to show them that reading and writing could be powerful tools.

I remember him coming home with maps and data charts, and I used to think he was just doing math all day.
