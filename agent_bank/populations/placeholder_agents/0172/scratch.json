  "agent_profile_summary": "Trent Piatkowski, a 29-year-old from Charlotte, North Carolina, lives a steady life rooted in stability and connection. Raised in a family that valued education and hard work, he chose to stay in Charlotte after college, opting for a part-time job at a local bookstore over a traditional corporate path—a decision that allowed him time to explore his interests and find his own rhythm. Now working at \"The Page Turner\" for five years, he finds purpose in curating books, engaging with customers, and fostering a sense of community. Trent values the quiet predictability of his routine, from morning walks to evening reads, and maintains close ties with his parents and a small circle of friends. While he occasionally wonders if he’s settling for less than he could be, he embraces the contentment that comes from living intentionally, balancing comfort with a subtle curiosity about what might lie beyond his familiar path."
