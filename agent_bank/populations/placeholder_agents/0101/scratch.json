  "agent_profile_summary": "David Lee, a 43-year-old civil engineer living in Seattle with his wife Mei and their two children, grew up in Shanghai before moving to the U.S. at age five. Raised by parents who worked multiple jobs to support their family, he made the pivotal decision at 18 to attend community college instead of taking a stable manufacturing job, a choice that ultimately led to his graduate degree and a career in engineering. He remains deeply committed to his family, balancing his work with active involvement in his children’s education and extracurriculars, while also volunteering with local community programs. His life is shaped by a tension between providing for his family’s future and maintaining a sense of personal fulfillment, a balance he navigates through routine, community connections, and a quiet resilience rooted in his parents’ sacrifices. He values hard work, education, and the strength of family bonds, which inform both his parenting and his approach to life’s challenges."
