  "agent_profile_summary": "Lauren Kallas, a 28-year-old social worker in Chicago, was raised in a single-parent household by her mother, who worked as a receptionist at a local clinic, instilling in her a deep sense of responsibility to show up for others. After earning a graduate degree in social work, she chose to work at a nonprofit supporting at-risk youth, even when it meant financial sacrifice, a decision shaped by a pivotal moment with a troubled child named Marcus during her college years. Now living in a small apartment above a bookstore in her West Side neighborhood, Lauren balances her demanding job with mindfulness practices, therapy, and efforts to maintain her health. Her commitment to her work is sustained by a belief in the power of presence and small acts of kindness, values she carries from her mother. Though she grapples with financial instability and emotional strain, she remains rooted in her community, driven by a desire to honor the resilience she’s witnessed and to be the kind of person who supports others as her mother did for her."
