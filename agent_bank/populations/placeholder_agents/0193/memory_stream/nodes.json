Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nNancy Anderson: Well, I was born in Evanston, Illinois, and I grew up in a small but tight-knit community. My parents were both hardworking people\u2014my father worked as an engineer, and my mother was a teacher. We had a modest but comfortable life, and I always felt lucky to have both of them around. I remember my father often coming home with stories from work, and my mother would read to me every night before bed. I went to school in Evanston, and I was pretty good at math and science, which I think came from my father's influence. I ended up going to college in the same state, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration. After college, I moved to Chicago for a few years to work in finance, but I eventually decided to come back to Evanston because I missed the slower pace and the sense of community. I met my husband, Mark, while I was working in Chicago\u2014he was a software developer, and we bonded over our love for classic rock and long weekend hikes. We got married a few years ago, and we've been trying to start a family, though it's been a bit of a journey. Life hasn't always been easy, but I've always tried to stay positive and focus on what I can control.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nNancy Anderson: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped the direction of my life. After I graduated from college with my Bachelor's in Business Administration, I had two main options: take a job at a local firm in Evanston or move to Chicago for a more prestigious position with a larger company. I was tempted by the bigger salary and the chance to climb the corporate ladder, but I also knew that moving to Chicago would mean leaving behind the close-knit community I grew up in, not to mention the comfort of my parents' home. I remember sitting at my father's kitchen table, staring at the job offer letter, and really thinking about what kind of life I wanted. I realized that while the Chicago job might offer more financial security, I didn't want to lose the sense of connection and stability that Evanston gave me. So I chose to stay local, and that decision ended up being the right one for me. It allowed me to build a career here, eventually start my own small business consulting firm, and stay close to my family. Looking back, I think that moment was a turning point because it taught me the importance of aligning my choices with my values, even if it meant taking a less obvious path.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nNancy Anderson: I think I made a conscious choice, though it wasn't always clear at the time. I remember feeling a bit of anxiety about turning down the Chicago job, because I didn't want to be seen as settling for less. But I also knew that I valued the relationships I had here more than I valued the idea of climbing a corporate ladder. I think it was a combination of intuition and reflection\u2014like I was really listening to myself, even if I didn't have all the answers. In the end, I made a decision that felt true to who I was, and that gave me a sense of peace I couldn't have gotten from a bigger paycheck. I think that's what I mean by making a conscious choice\u2014it wasn't just about what was in front of me, but about what I believed in and what I wanted my life to look like.\n\n",

My mother, for instance, was someone I could always count on. She had a way of putting things into perspective without being judgmental. I remember talking to her one evening, and she simply said, 'Nancy, you don't have to be the best at everything to be happy.' That really stuck with me. I also think a career counselor might have been useful\u2014someone who could have helped me weigh the pros and cons of each path more objectively. But in the end, I think the decision was mine to make, and I needed to trust my own instincts. I'm grateful I had the support of my family, even if I didn't always realize it at the time.\n\n",

We've been married for about six years now, and while our lives have been busy, we've always made an effort to keep our relationship strong. We both love the outdoors, so we try to take long hikes on the weekends, often exploring the nearby trails in the North Shore area. We also enjoy cooking together, especially on the weekends when we can take our time. As for children, we've been trying to start a family for a few years now, and while it's been a bit of a journey, we're both very hopeful and supportive of each other through it all. It's not easy, but I think it's strengthened our bond. My parents are still very much a part of our lives too\u2014my father still works part-time as a consultant, and my mother volunteers at the local library. They're both very active in our community, and I feel lucky to have them around. Family has always been really important to me, and I think that's something I inherited from my parents, who always put family first.\n\n",

She moved away after college to pursue a career in healthcare, and while we stay in touch, life has taken us in different directions.

One of them is Sarah, who I met in college. We were in the same business program, and we became close because we both had a passion for entrepreneurship. Even though she ended up moving to California after graduation, we've stayed in touch, and she's always been a source of inspiration for me. She started her own marketing firm, and I've always admired her courage and creativity. Then there's my friend Tom, who I've known since high school. He's a firefighter in Chicago, and he's been there for me through some tough times. We don't see each other as often as we used to, but whenever we do, it's like no time has passed. I think having friends like Sarah and Tom has been really important for me\u2014they remind me that life is about more than just work and family, and that it's okay to reach out and lean on others when things get tough.\n\n",

It's a mix of older homes and newer developments, and there's a real sense of community here. The streets are tree-lined, and there are a lot of families with kids, which makes it feel like a safe and welcoming place. I love that there are local shops and cafes within walking distance\u2014there's this little bakery called 'Maple Street Breads' that my mom frequents, and I've started going there too. The neighborhood also has a lot of parks and trails, which is perfect for Mark and me to take our weekend hikes. I think one of the things I appreciate most about living here is the balance between being close to the city and still having that small-town feel. It's not too busy, but it's never too quiet either. There are block parties in the summer, and people know each other by name. I feel like I'm part of something bigger here, and that's something I really value.\n\n",

Tell me about what it\u2019s been like for you living here.\n\nNancy Anderson: Living here has had its ups and downs, just like anywhere else. One of the biggest downs is the slow pace of change\u2014sometimes it feels like the neighborhood moves at its own rhythm, and that can be frustrating if you're used to more fast-paced environments. For example, when I first started my consulting business, I had to wait a while for the city to approve some permits for a small office space, and that delayed things a bit. But on the flip side, that same slow pace is what makes the community so strong. People take the time to get to know each other, and that builds trust. I also love how the seasons are so distinct here\u2014winters can be cold and snowy, which means cozy nights at home with Mark, and summers are perfect for outdoor activities. There's also a sense of history in the area, with many of the homes dating back decades, which gives the place a unique charm. Overall, I think the pros outweigh the cons, and I'm really happy I chose to stay here.\n\n",

I usually start my week with a morning walk by the lake, which helps me clear my head and get ready for the day. I work from home most of the time, running my small consulting business, so my days are a mix of client meetings, emails, and planning projects. Mondays are usually the busiest because that's when I catch up on everything from the weekend. Tuesdays and Wednesdays tend to be more focused on deep work, and I try to schedule meetings for the afternoons so I can have some quiet time in the mornings. Thursdays are often a bit lighter, and I like to use that time to run errands or meet up with friends for coffee. Fridays are my favorite because I can wind down a bit more, and I usually have a nice dinner with Mark. On the weekends, we're both pretty active\u2014whether it's hiking, visiting the local farmers' market, or just enjoying a lazy morning at home.

I finally made an appointment with a physical therapist, and through a combination of exercises and posture adjustments, I've been able to manage it much better.

Tell me all about how you have been feeling.\n\nNancy Anderson: Over the past year, I've been feeling a mix of gratitude and quiet determination. There have been moments of uncertainty, especially as we continue to navigate the path to starting a family, but I've also found a deep sense of contentment in the life I've built here in Evanston. Mark and I have grown closer through the challenges we've faced together, and I feel more connected to my community than ever before. I've also been reflecting a lot on my own growth\u2014how my small business has evolved, how I've learned to be more present in my daily life, and how I've come to appreciate the little things even more. There were times when I felt overwhelmed with work or the pressures of life, but I've also found strength in the support of my family and friends. I think the past year has been about learning to embrace both the challenges and the beauty of the everyday, and I'm hopeful that this continues to be a year of growth and connection for me and everyone I love.\n\n",

It also made me think about how important it is to listen to my body and not ignore the signals it sends, like the recurring back pain I've been dealing with. I've come to realize that staying healthy isn't just about being active or eating well\u2014it's about being mindful of how I move, sit, and take care of myself in all aspects of life. These conversations also made me appreciate the role of routine in maintaining that balance, whether it's through yoga, reading, or simply taking a few minutes each morning to breathe and be present. I think it's these small, consistent choices that help me feel grounded and ready to face whatever comes next.",

How about for you?\n\nNancy Anderson: I think I've been pretty fortunate in that I haven't struggled with depression or anxiety in the way some people do. That said, there have been moments\u2014especially during the early days of starting my business or when we were first trying to conceive\u2014when I felt overwhelmed or uncertain about the future. I remember one particular time when I was juggling a big project at work, Mark was dealing with a stressful time at his job, and we were still trying to figure out our next steps with family planning. It was a lot to handle all at once, and I definitely felt the weight of it. But I've always leaned on my support system\u2014my family, my friends, and even my yoga practice\u2014to help me through those moments. I think it's important to acknowledge when things feel heavy, even if it's not something that fits into a diagnosis. For me, it's been about finding small ways to cope, like talking to someone I trust or taking a walk by the lake to clear my mind. I don't want to minimize what others go through, but I do feel grateful that I've had the tools and relationships to get through those tough times without needing more formal help.\n\n",

I was raised Protestant, like my parents, and I still find comfort in the traditions we grew up with, like attending church on Sundays or celebrating holidays with family. But I don't see it as something I need to follow strictly. Instead, I think of it more as a foundation for the kindness and gratitude I try to carry with me every day. I believe in the importance of community, of helping others, and of finding meaning in the small moments, which I think are all things that my faith has helped instill in me. That said, I'm not someone who needs to attend services regularly or follow every rule\u2014I think of it more as a personal guide rather than a rigid structure. I'm grateful for the spiritual grounding I've had, but I also believe that spirituality can come from many places\u2014whether it's through nature, relationships, or even the simple act of showing up for the people you love.\n\n",

I used to be on Facebook more regularly, mostly to stay in touch with family and old friends, but I found that it started to take up more of my time than I wanted it to. I noticed that I was comparing my life to others' highlight reels, which didn't always make me feel good. So I decided to step back a bit and focus more on the people and experiences that matter most to me in real life. I still check in occasionally to see what my parents or sister are up to, and I follow a few local business pages for inspiration, but I don't spend a lot of time scrolling through feeds or engaging with content. I think it's important to have boundaries, especially with technology, and I've found that limiting my use of social media has helped me feel more present in my own life.

I think part of that comes from the mindfulness practices I've started incorporating into my mornings, which help me begin the day with a sense of calm rather than rushing into it. I've also been more open about my feelings with Mark, which has made a big difference in how I process worry or uncertainty. When I feel overwhelmed, I try to take a step back\u2014whether it's going for a walk, reading a chapter of a book, or even just sitting quietly for a few minutes.

We also had a significant portion of our budget go toward groceries, especially since I've been trying to meal plan more and eat healthier.

We typically spend about $3,500 to $4,700 each month, depending on how much I'm investing in my business or if we have any unexpected expenses. The bulk of our spending goes toward rent, utilities, and groceries, which are pretty standard for a family of two.

The location is perfect for us\u2014it's close to everything we need, like the local grocery store, the community center where I volunteer, and the parks where Mark and I like to hike. Renting has been a good fit for us, especially since we're still in the early stages of building our family. It gives us flexibility without the long-term commitment of a mortgage, and it's also easier to manage with my business, since I might need to adjust my space or even move if the right opportunity comes along.

Tell me all about how your bills have fluctuated over the past year.\n\nNancy Anderson: Over the past year, my bills have had their ups and downs, as they do for most people. For example, during the winter months, our heating bill went up significantly because of the colder temperatures, and we had to use our space heater more often. On the other hand, our electricity bill was lower in the winter because we were using less lighting and appliances since we spent more time at home. In the spring, we had a few unexpected expenses\u2014like a new air filter for the HVAC system and some repairs on the apartment's front door, which the landlord handled but still added to our monthly costs. Then, around the holidays, we had to budget more for groceries and small gifts for family and friends, which is something I always look forward to but also keeps me mindful of our spending. In the summer, our water bill went up a bit because of more frequent use from lawn care and outdoor activities, but we made up for it by being more efficient with our shower times and using a rain barrel for watering plants. Overall, I've learned to adjust our budget seasonally and keep a little extra set aside for these fluctuations, which has helped us stay on track without too much stress.\n\n",

I know that owning a home is something we've talked about in the future, but right now, with the uncertainty of our family planning journey and the flexibility that renting provides, it doesn't feel like the right time to commit to a mortgage.

That comes from my consulting business, which has been steady but not booming, and Mark's salary as a software developer. I've been trying to keep our finances as stable as possible, especially with our family planning journey, and I think we've managed to strike a good balance. I also take on a few freelance projects here and there, which helps supplement our income without adding too much stress. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our rent, groceries, and other essentials, and still allow us to save a little each month. I'm proud of how we've been able to manage our money responsibly, and I think it's a reflection of the values my parents instilled in me\u2014like planning ahead, being mindful of expenses, and always keeping a little something set aside for the future.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nNancy Anderson: I haven't had a traditional workplace in the way most people do, since I run my own consulting business from home. That said, I've been at this for about six years now, and it's been a journey of learning and growth. The benefits of being my own boss are both rewarding and challenging. On the positive side, I have the flexibility to set my own schedule, which is something I really value, especially with Mark's job and our family plans. I also have the freedom to choose the clients and projects I work on, which keeps me motivated and engaged. However, because I'm self-employed, I don't have the same structured benefits that come with a traditional job, like health insurance or paid vacation time. Instead, I've had to set those things up on my own\u2014like purchasing my own health insurance and setting aside money for time off throughout the year. It's not always easy, but I've come to appreciate the independence that comes with running my own business, even if it means shouldering more responsibility on my own.\n\n",

That said, I do work with a small team of part-time consultants, and our relationship is more like a collaborative partnership. We all have different strengths, and I try to foster an environment where everyone feels valued and heard. I make an effort to check in with them regularly, whether it's through weekly meetings or just casual conversations, to make sure we're all on the same page and working toward the same goals. I think the key to our success is mutual respect and clear communication. I also try to lead by example\u2014being reliable, transparent, and always willing to listen. It's not always perfect, but I've found that building strong, trusting relationships with the people I work with has made a huge difference in how we all approach our work and the challenges we face together.\n\n",

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nNancy Anderson: In terms of predictability, my work schedule has a certain rhythm to it, but it's not rigid like a traditional 9-to-5 job. I usually start my day around 8:00 AM, but I'm often up earlier, especially if I have a meeting or a project deadline. I find that mornings are my most productive time, so I try to get my deep work done before the day gets too busy. That said, there are days when I need to stay late or work on weekends, especially when I'm launching a new initiative or helping a client with something urgent. The flexibility is both a blessing and a challenge\u2014I love being able to adjust my hours to fit my life, but it also means I have to be disciplined about setting boundaries. I've learned to use a planner and set reminders for myself to ensure I'm not overworking or neglecting my personal time. Overall, I'd describe my job as having a flexible yet structured schedule that allows me to be present for both my work and my family, which is something I really value.\n\n",

It's not extravagant, but it's enough to cover our needs and give us some room to plan for the future. I know that not everyone has the same level of financial security, and I'm grateful for the work I've done to build a life that feels sustainable. There are definitely days when I worry about the uncertainties\u2014like the costs associated with starting a family or the potential fluctuations in my business\u2014but I try not to let those worries define how I feel about my finances. Instead, I focus on the fact that we're making responsible choices, saving where we can, and being mindful of our spending.

It also made me think about how I manage my income and savings, and how even small, consistent contributions add up over time to give me peace of mind. Discussing my work hours and the flexibility of running my own business helped me appreciate the balance I've found between being productive and being present for the people I love.

He would come home most days with stories about the projects he was working on, and I remember how proud he was of his work. My mother was a teacher, and she had a deep passion for education.

He had a strong sense of responsibility, and I remember him often saying that his work was about making sure communities had the tools they needed to thrive. My mother was a high school teacher, and her most important duties were planning lessons, grading papers, and, most importantly, connecting with her students.

They designed and oversaw the construction of roads, bridges, and public buildings, which meant he was often traveling between sites or working long hours. My mother worked for a public school district in Evanston, teaching high school mathematics. She was deeply committed to her students, and I remember her staying late after school to help kids who were struggling or to prepare for competitions. She also volunteered with local education initiatives, which showed me how much she believed in the power of learning. Both of them were part of stable, respected professions, and I think that gave me a sense of security growing up.

I hope Mark and I have built the family we've been working toward, and that we're raising children who feel loved, supported, and connected to the world around them. I also hope my business continues to grow in a way that allows me to support other local entrepreneurs, because I've always believed in the power of community and collaboration. I don't know exactly what the future will look like, but I hope it's filled with moments of connection, gratitude, and the kind of balance that makes life feel meaningful.
