Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nJessica Gonzalez: I was born in Mexico, but I moved to the United States when I was about five years old. My family settled in Minneapolis, and I've lived here ever since. Growing up, I was really close to my parents, who both have graduate degrees, which I think influenced my love for learning. My mom worked full-time, and my dad worked from home, so I grew up in a household that valued education and hard work. I was raised Catholic, but as I got older, I found myself less connected to religion. I speak Spanish at home, and I'm proud of that part of my heritage. I'm currently in school, working toward my degree, and I hope to one day make a difference in my community. Life hasn't been easy\u2014money has always been tight, and I've had to work part-time while going to school\u2014but I've always believed that education is the key to a better future.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nJessica Gonzalez: There was a moment in high school when I had to decide whether to take the easier path and go to a community college close to home or apply to a more competitive university that would challenge me more, even if it meant moving away from my family. I was really torn because I didn't want to leave my parents, especially since we weren't in a great financial position. But I also knew that if I stayed close, I might not get the opportunities I needed to grow. I remember talking to my mom late one night, and she said, 'If you want something more, you have to be willing to work for it.' That really stuck with me. I applied to a few schools, got into one that offered a scholarship, and I took the leap. It wasn't easy\u2014missing my family, adjusting to a new environment, and managing school and work all at once\u2014but that experience shaped who I am today. It taught me resilience, independence, and the importance of believing in myself even when things feel uncertain.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nJessica Gonzalez: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made easily. I had to weigh so many things\u2014my family, my finances, my future. I didn't just wake up one day and decide to leave; it was a lot of late-night conversations, a lot of doubt, and a lot of hope. I remember sitting at my kitchen table, looking at the acceptance letter, and realizing that this was my chance to build something for myself. I made a list of all the 'what-ifs' and 'what-ifs' kept me up at night. But in the end, I chose to take the risk because I believed in the possibility of something better. I think that's what makes a choice conscious\u2014it's not just about the decision itself, but the weight you carry when you make it.\n\n",

I think if I had reached out to a counselor at my high school or even connected with a mentor in my community, it might have made the decision a little easier. I was pretty shy back then, and I didn't want to burden anyone with my worries. But looking back, I realize how much support I could have had. There was a local nonprofit that helped students apply for scholarships, and I remember seeing their flyers, but I didn't have the confidence to walk in. I wish I had taken that step. Sometimes, the people and organizations around us have the tools we need\u2014we just need the courage to ask for help.\n\n",

They've been through a lot with me\u2014supporting me through school, helping me with expenses when I could barely afford rent, and always reminding me that I'm capable of more than I sometimes believe. My mom still works full-time, and my dad is a teacher at a local school, which I think is why he always encouraged me to pursue education. I have a younger sister who's in high school, and we're really close. She's the one who actually pushed me to apply for that scholarship I mentioned earlier. She saw something in me that I didn't see in myself. Even though I'm away from home now, I try to stay connected with them as much as I can.

They've always been a big part of my life, even though I haven't been able to visit them in person since I moved to the U.S. My abuela, in particular, has been a huge influence on me. She's the one who taught me to cook traditional dishes and to value family above all else. Even though we're separated by distance, she's always been there for me, sending care packages with food and letters filled with advice. My grandpa, on the other hand, is more of a quiet presence\u2014always listening, always watching. He used to tell me stories about growing up in Mexico, and I think those stories helped me feel connected to my roots, even when I was struggling to find my place here.

One of them, Maria, is actually someone I met in college. We bonded over our shared experiences as first-generation students and the pressure we felt to make our families proud. She's become like a sister to me, and we've supported each other through late-night study sessions, job searches, and even moments of self-doubt. There's also a group of friends from my hometown that I still keep in touch with\u2014some of them are in the same boat as me, trying to make it through school while working part-time. I think what makes these relationships so important is that they remind me I'm not alone in this journey.

It's a bit on the quieter side, with a lot of tree-lined streets and small businesses that give the area a community feel. There's a local library nearby that I go to often\u2014it's a quiet place to study, and they have a lot of resources for students like me. I also live in an apartment complex that's pretty affordable, though it's not the most luxurious. The building has a small courtyard where people gather, and I've gotten to know some of my neighbors. Some of them are students too, and others are working professionals. I like that there's a sense of shared purpose here, even if we're all in different stages of life.

I've never had any real issues with crime or feeling unsafe, which is something I'm grateful for. That said, I know not everyone feels the same way, especially if they're from a different background or don't have the same resources as I do. I think safety is something that depends a lot on where you live and who you know.

On the positive side, the sense of community is something I really appreciate. I've met people from all walks of life, and it's amazing how we can come together over shared goals, like education or just wanting to make the best of our circumstances. The library is a big part of my routine, and I've even started volunteering there a few days a week, which has been really fulfilling. It gives me a chance to give back, and it also helps me stay connected to my purpose. That said, there are days when I feel the weight of everything I'm trying to balance\u2014school, work, rent, and the constant pressure to do better. I don't have a lot of extra money, so sometimes I have to make tough choices, like skipping meals to afford books or sacrificing sleep to finish an assignment.

I usually start my week on Monday with a big cup of coffee and a quick breakfast before heading to class. I'm enrolled in a full-time program, so my days are packed with lectures, group projects, and readings. After class, I work part-time at a local bookstore, which I actually enjoy because it's a calm environment and I get to interact with people who love books as much as I do. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are usually the busiest days for me\u2014more assignments, more meetings, and sometimes even a bit of overtime at work. Thursdays are my favorite because I have a study group in the evening, and we meet at the library. It's a great way to stay on track and support each other.

I found a short meditation app that I use during my breaks at work, and I've started writing in a journal every morning before I get out of bed.

The biggest thing was when I started experiencing persistent back pain, probably from sitting for long hours during classes and work. At first, I tried to ignore it, thinking it would go away on its own, but it got worse over time. I finally went to the campus health center, and they diagnosed me with a mild spinal strain. It was a wake-up call\u2014I realized I hadn't been taking care of my body the way I should have. I started seeing a physical therapist, and I've been doing some exercises to strengthen my core and improve my posture. It's been a slow process, but I'm getting better. Along with that, I've also been dealing with occasional migraines, especially during stressful periods. I think the combination of stress, lack of sleep, and not eating regularly has contributed to that.

I've learned to be more honest with myself about what I can handle and what I need to let go of. There were times when I felt overwhelmed, especially when I was juggling school, work, and taking care of my sister.

How about for you?\n\nJessica Gonzalez: I think I've struggled with anxiety more than anything else, especially when things feel out of control or when I'm overwhelmed with responsibilities. There were times when I would lie awake at night, worrying about whether I was doing enough for my family, whether I was going to fail my classes, or whether I was making the right choices for my future. It's not something I used to talk about openly, but I've started to realize that it's okay to not be okay. I've been working with a counselor at the university, and that's been a huge help. She's taught me how to recognize when my anxiety is creeping in and how to manage it before it takes over. I've also started using grounding techniques, like deep breathing or focusing on the present moment, which has made a difference. I don't think I'll ever be completely free of anxiety, but I'm learning to live with it instead of letting it define me.

They've sacrificed so much to give me the chance to be here, and I know they're proud of the work I'm doing, but they also worry about the stress I'm under. My mom, in particular, has been talking to me more about her own fears\u2014about whether I'm eating enough, whether I'm getting enough sleep, and whether I'm taking care of myself. She doesn't want me to burn out the way she did in her own career. My dad, on the other hand, is more focused on encouraging me to keep going, reminding me that I'm capable of more than I sometimes believe. My sister has been my biggest cheerleader, though. She's been through her own struggles, and she knows what it's like to feel like you're fighting an uphill battle. She texts me every day, just to check in, and sometimes we talk for hours about our dreams and fears.

It was a part of our lives, and I remember feeling a sense of comfort in the rituals and the community. But as I got older, I started to question a lot of things\u2014why certain things happened, why the world was the way it was, and whether faith was enough to explain it all. I didn't walk away from it suddenly; it was more of a slow shift. I stopped going to church, and over time, I stopped identifying as Catholic. Now, I don't really think of myself as religious, but I do believe in something bigger than myself. I think of it more as a personal spirituality\u2014like the idea that we're all connected, and that love, kindness, and resilience are what matter most. I don't need a church to feel that, and I think that's what makes me who I am today. I respect my roots, but I also respect the freedom to find my own path.\n\n",

Rent is the largest chunk of my budget\u2014my apartment is affordable, but it still takes up about half of what I earn from my part-time job and any financial help my parents can give. Groceries are another challenge because I try to eat healthy, but with a tight budget, I often have to buy in bulk or choose cheaper options, which can be tricky when I need to make sure I'm getting enough nutrients. Tuition is something I pay for through a combination of scholarships, grants, and a small loan I took out, so that's a fixed cost every month. I also have to set aside money for books and transportation, which adds up. What's interesting is that I've started tracking my expenses more closely, and it's helped me see where I can cut back, like eating out less or buying secondhand textbooks.

The majority of that goes to rent, which is about $1,000 a month, and groceries, which hover around $500. Tuition and fees are another $600, and then there's about $100 for books and supplies, plus transportation and miscellaneous expenses. It's not a lot, but it's enough to get by, especially since my parents still help out when they can.

The landlord is pretty understanding, especially since we're students and sometimes have to stretch our budget thin. Renting has been the only option for us, since buying a home isn't really feasible right now with the way the market is. I know my parents have thought about it, but they've always said we should focus on getting our education first. It's funny, though\u2014sometimes I look at other families with homes and I wonder what it would be like to have that kind of stability. But I also know that renting has its own kind of freedom. We can move if we need to, and it's easier to manage with our current income. I just hope that one day, when I'm more financially secure, I can help my parents buy a home of their own.

For example, during the winter months, heating costs went up a bit, and I had to be more careful with my electricity usage because of the cold. I also noticed that groceries were more expensive around the holidays, especially when I had to buy extra food for my sister and me when we were both studying for finals. Tuition and fees stayed the same throughout the year, but I did have to pay for a few unexpected things, like a new pair of shoes for work or a textbook I had to buy last minute. One of the biggest changes was during the summer when I had to pay for a summer session at school, which added a few hundred dollars to my monthly budget. It was tough because I was already working part-time and trying to save as much as I could. But I learned to adjust by cutting back on non-essentials, like eating out or buying new clothes.

That includes my part-time income from the bookstore, some financial support from my parents, and a small scholarship I received for my studies. It's not a lot, but it's enough to cover our basic needs\u2014rent, groceries, tuition, and a few other essentials. I've been trying to be more careful with every dollar, like buying secondhand textbooks or using public transportation instead of Uber when I can. It's a tight budget, but I know it's temporary. I'm working toward a future where I can afford more stability\u2014not just for myself, but for my family too. I've learned that every little bit counts, and even small sacrifices now can lead to bigger opportunities later.\n\n",

The job itself doesn't come with many traditional benefits like health insurance or paid vacation, which is something I've had to be mindful of. But what I appreciate most are the intangible benefits\u2014the sense of community, the people I've met, and the way the job fits into my life in a way that feels meaningful. I don't have a lot of time off, but when I do get days off, I try to use them to recharge, whether that's by spending time with my family, going for a run, or just catching up on rest. I know I'm not in a position to ask for much, but I'm grateful for the flexibility the store gives me, especially since I'm a student. It's not perfect, but it's a job that allows me to contribute, learn, and grow\u2014things that matter more to me than any formal benefits.\n\n",

He's been in the business for a while and has a lot of experience, but he's also very understanding of students who are juggling school and work. He's given me a lot of flexibility, like adjusting my hours when I need to study for exams or when I have to help my sister with something. He doesn't treat me like just another employee\u2014he sees me as someone who's working toward a bigger goal, and that means a lot. As for my coworkers, we get along really well. Most of them are also students or people who work part-time while going to school, so we all understand the challenges of balancing everything. We often help each other out, whether it's covering a shift or just giving advice on how to manage time better. It's a small team, but there's a real sense of camaraderie. I feel lucky to be part of that environment\u2014it makes the job feel less like a burden and more like a shared experience.\n\n",

I usually work the same hours every week\u2014afternoons from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM, Monday through Friday. That consistency helps me plan my days around classes, study time, and taking care of my sister. That said, there's some flexibility when needed. If I have an exam or a big assignment coming up, I can talk to my manager about adjusting my hours a bit, and he's usually pretty understanding. I also get to choose which days I work, as long as I cover the store's needs. It's not the most flexible job in the world, but for someone like me who's trying to balance school, work, and family, that predictability is a real blessing.

I know I'm not in a position of financial comfort, but I also know that I'm doing everything I can to move forward. Every dollar I save, every scholarship I apply for, every extra hour I work\u2014it all adds up to something bigger. I don't always feel secure, but I do feel hopeful.

Talking about how my bills fluctuate throughout the year reminded me of the unpredictability of life and how important it is to be prepared for changes, whether they come in the form of higher heating costs, unexpected expenses, or the need to adjust my budget for school sessions. It also made me think about how my part-time job at the bookstore, while not glamorous, plays a crucial role in helping me stay afloat. The predictability of my work schedule gives me a sense of control, even when everything else feels uncertain. I've learned that managing money isn't just about saving\u2014it's about making choices that align with my values and my future. Even though I don't have a formal savings account, I'm proud of the small steps I've taken to build something for myself and my family.

My mom worked full-time as a nurse, and my dad worked from home as a teacher. They both had stable jobs, which gave me a sense of security growing up, even though we weren't wealthy. My mom's job was demanding\u2014she worked long hours, sometimes even nights, but she always made sure I had what I needed. My dad, on the other hand, had more flexibility because he worked from home, which allowed him to be more present in my life. He was always there to help with homework, drive me to school, or just sit with me when I was feeling down. I think their work ethic and the sacrifices they made for our family are what taught me the value of hard work and education. Even though they both had their own challenges, they never let it get in the way of supporting me. I know I wouldn't be where I am today without their dedication and the example they set for me.\n\n",

She was always on her feet, sometimes working 12-hour shifts, and she had to be really organized to keep up with the demands of the job. She also had to be emotionally strong, because she dealt with people who were in pain or going through tough times. My dad worked as a teacher, and his most important duties were planning lessons, grading papers, and helping students understand difficult concepts. He also spent a lot of time communicating with parents and making sure that every student felt supported. What I remember most about both of their jobs is how much they cared about what they did. My mom would come home exhausted but still make time to talk to me about my day, and my dad would help me with my homework even when he was tired. They both showed me that work isn't just about earning a paycheck\u2014it's about making a difference in people's lives, and that lesson has stayed with me ever since.\n\n",

She made a good salary, but it wasn't enough to cover everything, especially with two kids in school and the cost of living here in Minneapolis. My dad, on the other hand, worked at a high school where he taught math and also coached the soccer team. He had a lot of students who looked up to him, and I remember seeing how proud he was when they succeeded. He didn't make as much as my mom, but he always said that the most important part of his job was helping kids believe in themselves. I think that's what I took from their work\u2014it wasn't just about the money or the title, but about the impact they had on others. They both gave so much of themselves to their jobs, and I think that's why I value education and hard work so much today.\n\n",
