  "agent_profile_summary": "Kelly Sullivan, 21, grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Charleston, South Carolina, where her parents worked hard to support their family despite limited education and resources. After high school, she made a conscious decision to leave her familiar surroundings and move to Charlotte, where she worked retail and took night classes, realizing she needed to pursue education to break the cycle of her parents' struggles. Now back in Charleston, she balances part-time work at a small bookstore with helping her friend Jamie run a nonprofit that supports people in her community. Her life is shaped by a desire for stability and a commitment to helping others, even as she navigates financial uncertainty and personal growth. She values the support of her family, especially her brother, and finds strength in small, consistent efforts—like walking by the river or studying for her GED—to build a future that feels like her own."
