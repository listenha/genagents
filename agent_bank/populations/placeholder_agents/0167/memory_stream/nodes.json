Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nJoshua Lawson: I was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in a tight-knit neighborhood on the outskirts of the city. My parents were both well-educated\u2014my father has a bachelor's degree in business, and my mother has a graduate degree in education. We lived a comfortable life, with both of my parents working full-time, which allowed me to have access to good schools and extracurricular activities. I was a pretty quiet kid, more interested in reading and spending time with friends than in sports or other typical teenage stuff. I graduated high school a few years ago, but I didn't go to college right away. Instead, I took some time to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Right now, I'm helping out at home while I explore my options, and I'm trying to stay involved in my community through volunteer work and local activism. I've always leaned left politically, and being a strong Democrat feels natural to me\u2014it's about fighting for equality, education, and making sure people have the opportunities I had.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nJoshua Lawson: There was definitely a crossroads moment for me, though it wasn't as dramatic as some people might imagine. I was about 19, right after high school, and I had a few options in front of me. I could have gone to community college, taken a gap year, or even tried to get a job in the city. I was feeling a bit lost, honestly\u2014like I didn't want to just follow the traditional path of going straight to college, but I also didn't want to feel like I was wasting time. I ended up taking a part-time job at a local nonprofit that worked with youth education programs. That experience was eye-opening. I saw firsthand how many kids in my neighborhood didn't have the same opportunities I did, and it made me realize how much I wanted to be part of something bigger. It also made me question whether I wanted to go to college at all, or if I wanted to find a way to make a difference without a degree. In the end, I decided to take a gap year, work with the nonprofit, and explore my interests more. That time helped me grow a lot, and it ultimately led me to where I am today\u2014still figuring things out, but with a clearer sense of purpose.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nJoshua Lawson: I think it was a mix of both, honestly. There was a conscious choice to step back and reflect, but a lot of it also just happened as I got involved with the nonprofit. I didn't set out to change my path, but the people I met and the work I did started shaping my perspective in ways I hadn't anticipated. I remember one kid I worked with\u2014his family was struggling, and he was really bright but didn't have the resources to pursue higher education. That moment stuck with me. It wasn't just about making a decision; it was about realizing that my actions could have an impact, even if I wasn't sure what that impact would be. I think that's when I stopped trying to force a direction and started letting the experiences guide me instead.\n\n",

I remember feeling pretty isolated in my decision-making process, like I was trying to figure everything out on my own. If there had been a mentor or a community program that could have helped me explore my options more thoughtfully, I think I might have felt less pressure to make the 'right' choice right away. The nonprofit I worked with was great, but it was more about the work than the support. I wish there had been more resources for young people in my neighborhood who were trying to navigate their futures without a clear path. It's something I've started thinking about more as I've gotten involved in local activism\u2014how we can create more support systems for kids who are in similar situations to me.\n\n",

My family is my parents and my two younger siblings\u2014my sister is in her second year of college, studying environmental science, and my brother is still in high school, though he's already showing a lot of promise in the arts. My parents are still very involved in my life, even though I'm not living under their roof anymore. They've always been supportive of my decisions, even when I wasn't sure what I was doing. I think that's one of the reasons I feel comfortable being so open about my political views and my desire to make a difference. My family has always encouraged me to think critically and to stand up for what I believe in, which is something I really appreciate.

The crossroads moment at 19 was a turning point, even if it wasn't as dramatic as I once thought. It was the time I started to understand the importance of community and the impact one person can have, especially in a neighborhood where opportunities aren't always equal. I realize now that my journey wasn't just about making a decision\u2014it was about being open to experiences and letting them guide me. I also think about how much support I wish I had back then, not just from a nonprofit but from a structured system that helps young people like me navigate their futures. And even though I don't have a partner or children yet, my family remains a constant source of strength and encouragement, which I'm incredibly grateful for. These reflections have made me more determined to give back and create the kind of support system I wish I had when I was younger.",

My grandmother, in particular, has always been a source of wisdom and strength. She's retired now, but she used to work as a nurse, and she's always had a way of making you feel seen and heard. I remember spending a lot of time with her when I was younger, especially during the summers. She taught me how to cook, how to garden, and how to really listen to people. My grandfather passed away a few years ago, but I still think about him often. He was a quiet man, but he had a way of making you feel like you were the most important person in the room. My relationship with my grandparents is more about respect and gratitude than anything else. They've always supported my parents, and by extension, me. Even though I don't see them as often as I'd like, I know they're always in my corner.\n\n",

Are there people outside of your family who are important to you?\n\nJoshua Lawson: Outside of my family, there are a few friends who have been really important to me, especially during the time I was working with the nonprofit. One of them, Marcus, was someone I met through the program, and we ended up becoming really close. He's a few years older than me, and he had already been through a lot of the same struggles I was facing. He became like a brother to me, and he helped me see things in a different light. He encouraged me to keep pushing forward, even when I felt stuck. I also have a few friends from high school who I still keep in touch with\u2014some of them went to college, others took different paths, but we all stayed connected. I think having people who understand where you're coming from is really important, especially when you're trying to figure out your place in the world.

It's a pretty diverse area, with a lot of young professionals moving in alongside long-time residents. I like that it's not too far from the city center, so I can still get involved in local events and activism without feeling too removed from the community. There's a small park nearby where I often go to read or just clear my head, and a few cafes that have become my go-to spots for coffee and conversation. The neighborhood has its challenges, like with gentrification and rising rents, but there's also a strong sense of community here. I've met a lot of people through local meetings and volunteer work, and I think that's one of the reasons I feel so connected to the area.

That said, there are parts of the neighborhood where things can get a little rough, especially late at night.

There's a lot of potential here, and I see it every day in the people who are trying to make things better, whether it's through small acts of kindness or bigger efforts like organizing community clean-ups or advocating for affordable housing. But it's also been tough at times, especially when I see how quickly things can change. I've watched some of my neighbors get priced out because of rising rents, and it's heartbreaking.

Other days, I might spend the morning reading or writing\u2014whether it's for a blog I started about social justice issues or just journaling to process my thoughts. I also try to make time for volunteering with a few different organizations, like a food pantry and a youth mentorship group.

I think cooking is a way to take care of myself, especially when I'm juggling so many different responsibilities.

She suggested that writing down my thoughts and setting small, achievable goals could help me stay focused on my long-term vision. So now, I dedicate about 30 minutes each morning after my meditation to journaling\u2014sometimes it's just stream-of-consciousness, other times it's more about tracking my progress or brainstorming ideas for projects I want to work on. It's been helpful in keeping me grounded, especially with everything going on in the neighborhood and with my work.

A typical weekday for them during the school year starts with getting up early, usually around 7 or 8 a.m., followed by breakfast and getting ready for school. Most of them ride the bus or walk to school, and they're usually back by 3 or 3:30 p.m. After school, many of them come to the community center for after-school programs\u2014some for homework help, others for art classes, sports, or tutoring. I've seen how important those programs are, especially for kids who don't have a lot of structure at home. It's amazing how much they can accomplish in a few hours, and it's one of the reasons I keep doing this work.

I used to be pretty sedentary when I was younger, especially during high school, when I spent a lot of time reading or just hanging out with friends.

It's those moments of stillness that remind me why I'm doing all of this. I also really enjoy cooking at home, even if it's just something simple, because it gives me a sense of control and care over my body. But on the harder side, it's the unpredictability of my schedule. Some days I'm running from one meeting to another, or I'm helping out with a program that runs late, and that can make it tough to stick to a regular routine. I also struggle with stress, especially when I'm juggling work, volunteering, and trying to stay connected with family. It's not always easy to prioritize self-care when there's so much going on, but I'm learning that even small things\u2014like taking a few deep breaths or setting aside 10 minutes to stretch\u2014can make a big difference.

That said, there were a few moments where I had to slow down and take care of myself. One thing that stood out was a period of intense stress during the pandemic resurgence, when I was juggling more volunteer work and community organizing than ever before. I started experiencing some chronic fatigue and occasional chest tightness, which I initially brushed off as just being overworked. But after a few weeks of not feeling like myself, I made an appointment with my doctor. They ran some tests and found that I had mild anxiety-related symptoms, which made sense given the amount of emotional labor I was taking on. It was a wake-up call for me to prioritize my mental health more seriously. Since then, I've been more consistent with therapy, meditation, and setting boundaries around my work. I've also started paying more attention to how my body reacts to stress, and I've learned that even small changes\u2014like taking a break from screens or going for a walk\u2014can make a big difference. I think the biggest takeaway from that experience is that health isn't just about physical well-being; it's also about recognizing when you need to slow down and take care of yourself, even if it doesn't feel like the most productive thing to do at the time.\n\n",

How about you?\n\nJoshua Lawson: Honestly, I haven't had any health issues that have really disrupted my ability to work or care for others, which I'm grateful for. But I think it's important to acknowledge that even small things can have a ripple effect. For example, during that time when I was dealing with anxiety-related symptoms, I found myself more easily overwhelmed by the demands of my work and volunteer commitments. It wasn't something that stopped me from showing up, but it did make me more prone to burnout and less able to give my full attention to the people I was trying to help. That experience taught me that my well-being isn't just a personal issue\u2014it affects how I show up for others. I've since made a conscious effort to build in more rest and reflection, not just for myself, but also to model that for the kids I work with. I want them to know that it's okay to take a step back and take care of yourself, even if it feels counterintuitive when you're trying to make a difference.\n\n",

On one hand, I've been really proud of the work I've been doing in the community, especially with the kids at the community center. It's rewarding to see them grow and to know that I'm playing a small part in their journey. I've also been more intentional about taking care of myself, which has made a big difference in how I feel day to day. I've started setting clearer boundaries between my work and my personal time, which has helped me avoid burnout. But there's also been a lot of uncertainty, especially with the political climate and the ongoing issues in our neighborhood. I worry about the future, not just for myself but for the kids I work with and the people I care about. I feel like I'm in a place where I can make a difference, but I also know that change doesn't happen overnight. It's a balancing act\u2014between staying hopeful and being realistic about the challenges we face.

How about for you?\n\nJoshua Lawson: I think I've definitely struggled with anxiety at times, especially when I'm juggling a lot of responsibilities or feeling the weight of the issues in our community. It's not something I always talk about openly, but there have been moments when I felt overwhelmed by the pressure to do more, to be more, or to make a bigger impact than I think I can handle. I remember one particular stretch where I was working long hours at the community center, volunteering with multiple groups, and trying to stay connected with family and friends. I started feeling like I was constantly running on empty, and it was hard to tell where one responsibility ended and another began. I didn't want to burden anyone with my struggles, so I tried to push through, but it wasn't sustainable. That's when I realized I needed to be more honest about how I was feeling and ask for support when I needed it. I started seeing a counselor, and that made a huge difference. It helped me understand that it's okay to feel anxious or uncertain, and that taking care of my mental health isn't a sign of weakness\u2014it's just as important as taking care of my physical health.

They want the best for me, and they've seen me go through a lot in the past few years\u2014whether it's the stress of community work, the challenges of gentrification in our neighborhood, or just the general pressure of figuring out what comes next. My sister, who's in college, has been a big source of encouragement. She's always pushing me to think about the long-term and to not be afraid of taking risks. My brother, on the other hand, is still in high school, and I think he looks up to me in a way that's both humbling and a little overwhelming. He's starting to explore his own interests, and I want to be a good example for him, even if I'm not entirely sure where I'm headed myself.

That said, I do think about the idea of purpose and how we connect to something bigger than ourselves\u2014whether it's through community, activism, or just being there for the people around me. I've always felt that sense of responsibility to make a difference, and in a way, that's been my own kind of guiding force.

I follow a lot of local activists, community organizers, and journalists who cover issues like housing, education, and racial justice. Instagram and Twitter have been especially useful for me because they allow me to see what's happening in real time and engage with people who are fighting for similar things. I also use Facebook to stay in touch with family and old friends, especially since I don't see them as often as I'd like. I try to be intentional about how I use these platforms\u2014like limiting my time on them when I'm feeling overwhelmed or stressed. There's a lot of noise online, but I've learned to curate my feed so that it's mostly filled with voices that inspire me or challenge me to think differently.

There have been times when I posted about the challenges of community organizing or the stress of trying to make a difference, and people have reached out with encouragement or shared their own stories.

I used to feel like I was constantly on edge, especially with everything going on in the neighborhood and the work I do. But lately, I've been more intentional about how I manage that stress. I've started incorporating more mindfulness into my routine, like short breathing exercises throughout the day or even just pausing for a few minutes when I feel overwhelmed.

I live in a small one-bedroom apartment near the community center, and the rent is about $1,200 a month. That's a chunk of my income, but I chose this location because it's close to where I work and volunteer, which makes it easier to stay connected to the neighborhood. Groceries usually come out to around $300, depending on what I'm cooking and how often I eat out. I try to cook most of my meals at home, but I do splurge on coffee or a meal out once in a while, especially on weekends when I meet up with friends. Transportation is another big one\u2014since I don't own a car, I rely on public transit and sometimes ride-sharing apps, which adds up to about $150 a month. I also set aside money for utilities, internet, and a small amount for personal care and miscellaneous expenses. To make ends meet, I work part-time at the community center and do some freelance writing on the side. It's not always easy balancing everything, but I've learned to be pretty frugal and prioritize what's most important. I also try to save a little each month, even if it's just a small amount, just in case something unexpected comes up.\n\n",

For example, during the colder months, my utility bills tend to go up a little because I use more heating, and I also spend a bit more on groceries if I'm hosting friends or buying ingredients for meals I can share with the community center. On the flip side, in the summer, I might spend a little less on heating but more on things like sunscreen or outdoor gear if I'm going on a walk or volunteering in the park. I've gotten pretty good at tracking my expenses using a simple spreadsheet, which helps me stay on top of things and make sure I'm not overspending. It's not always easy, especially when I'm trying to balance work, volunteering, and personal time, but I've learned that small adjustments\u2014like cooking at home more or using public transit instead of ride-sharing\u2014can make a big difference in the long run.

In the winter months, my utility bills went up because I was using more electricity for heating, and I also spent a bit more on groceries since I was cooking more at home and hosting friends for meals. I remember one month in January when I had to replace the heater in my apartment, which was an unexpected expense that added a few hundred dollars to my bill. That was stressful, but I was able to cover it with some savings I had set aside. In the summer, my electricity usage went down, but I started spending more on things like sunscreen, outdoor gear, and even a few ice cream treats to stay cool.

In addition to my part-time work at the community center, I also do some freelance writing on the side\u2014mostly for local blogs, activist groups, or even social media campaigns that align with the causes I care about. It's not always steady work, and there are months where I don't get any freelance gigs, but it gives me the flexibility to explore different interests and support myself in a way that feels meaningful. I also volunteer with a few different organizations, like a food pantry and a youth mentorship group, which isn't paid work, but it's something I feel called to do. It's a bit of a juggling act, but I've learned to be intentional about how I spend my time. I think having multiple sources of income and involvement helps me stay grounded and reminds me that I don't have to follow one single path to make a difference. It's not always easy, but I'm grateful for the opportunities I have and the ways I can contribute to my community.\n\n",

I've come to realize that my mental health is just as important as my work or my community involvement, and I'm learning to prioritize that in ways I didn't before. Talking about my monthly budget and expenses also made me think about how much I've grown in terms of financial responsibility. I used to feel overwhelmed by the numbers, but now I see them as part of a bigger picture\u2014one that includes not just survival, but also the ability to give back and support others. It's not always easy, but I'm trying to be more intentional with how I spend my time, money, and energy.

That comes from my part-time job at the community center, which pays around $15 an hour, and the freelance writing I do on the side. I usually work about 20 to 25 hours a week at the center, so that's roughly $300 to $375 a week, and then the freelance work varies\u2014sometimes I get a few gigs, sometimes not. I also have some small stipends from volunteer work, but those aren't consistent. It's not a lot, but it's enough to cover my basic needs and give me some flexibility. I've learned to be pretty careful with my money, especially since I don't have a lot of savings yet. I try to budget everything out, and I've gotten pretty good at tracking my expenses so I know where my money is going. It's not always easy, especially when I'm trying to balance work, volunteering, and personal time, but I've come to accept that this is where I am right now.

The benefits of the job aren't the traditional ones you might expect\u2014there's no health insurance or paid vacation time, but what I get instead is something just as valuable: purpose. I know I'm not making a lot of money, but I feel like I'm contributing to something meaningful. The center offers some minimal benefits, like a small stipend for meals during long shifts and the ability to take unpaid leave if needed, which has been helpful in the past. What I appreciate most is the flexibility\u2014it allows me to be present for my family, my community, and my own growth. I don't always have the luxury of time off, but when I do, it's because I've earned it through the work I do with the kids.

My manager, Ms. Carter, is someone I really look up to\u2014she's been through a lot in her own life and has this way of seeing potential in people even when they don't see it in themselves. She's never been overly strict or demanding; instead, she leads by example and always makes sure we feel valued for the work we do. As for my coworkers, we're all in this together. Some of them have been with the center longer than I have, and they've been great mentors, especially when it comes to understanding the nuances of working with kids in the neighborhood. We joke around, we support each other during tough times, and we all share this common goal of making a difference.

Most of the time, I have a general idea of when I'll be working\u2014like, if there's an after-school program running, I know I'll be there from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., but there are also days where I can adjust my hours depending on what's needed. For example, if a workshop is scheduled earlier in the day or if someone needs coverage for a meeting, I can swap shifts with a coworker or come in a little earlier or stay a little later. That kind of flexibility is important for me, especially since I also volunteer with other organizations and need to stay connected with my family.

I've learned to be really intentional about every dollar I spend, and I think that's helped me stay afloat.

Even though my mother had some time off during summers and holidays, she was always involved in her work, and it was clear how much she cared about her students.

His most important activities involved coordinating between different departments, ensuring that projects stayed on schedule, and maintaining relationships with clients and vendors. He was pretty hands-on, always making sure that the team had what they needed to succeed.

He taught me the value of responsibility and the importance of showing up, even when things got tough. My mother, on the other hand, was a high school teacher, and her most important duties revolved around creating lesson plans, grading assignments, and, most importantly, connecting with her students. She had a way of making even the most difficult subjects feel accessible, and she always encouraged her students to think critically and question everything. I remember watching her work late into the night, grading papers and preparing for the next day, and it made me realize how much dedication it took to be a teacher. Both of them had different jobs, but they shared a common trait\u2014they were both deeply committed to their work and to making a difference, even in small ways.

She didn't just teach the material; she made sure her students felt seen and supported. She was always coming up with creative ways to engage them, whether it was through group projects, debates, or even bringing in guest speakers to talk about real-world issues.
