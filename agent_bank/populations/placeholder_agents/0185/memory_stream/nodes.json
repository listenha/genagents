    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nLeah Robinson: I was born and raised in the United States, in a small town in the West South Central region, and I've always felt a deep connection to my roots. My parents both have graduate degrees, which was pretty rare in our community back then, and they always emphasized the importance of education. I grew up in a tight-knit family, living with both of my parents, and we had a stable household with above-average income. My father was a professor at a local university, and my mother worked as a nurse, so I was exposed to both academia and healthcare from a young age. I remember sitting in on my father's lectures when I was a kid, and that sparked my love for learning. I was always curious, always asking questions, and I think that's what led me to pursue a graduate degree in social work. I wanted to help people in the way my mother did, but also to address the systemic issues that my father often talked about. I moved to Dallas when I was 18 for college, and I've been here ever since, though I've changed cities a few times. I've never been married, and I've always focused on my career and my community. I work full-time now as a social worker, and I'm still very active in my church, which has been a big part of my life since I was a teenager. I'm proud of where I came from, and I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nLeah Robinson: Yes, there was definitely a crossroads moment for me, and it came right after I finished my undergraduate degree. I had been accepted into a prestigious graduate program in public policy, which was a huge opportunity. At the same time, I was offered a full-time position at a nonprofit organization focused on community outreach and mental health support. I was torn because the graduate program would have given me a broader platform to effect change on a systemic level, but the nonprofit job would have allowed me to work directly with people in need, face-to-face, in the communities I grew up in. I spent weeks talking to my parents, my pastor, and even some of my professors. My father reminded me that while policy can shape the world, it's the people on the ground who make those policies meaningful. My mother, on the other hand, encouraged me to pursue the degree because she believed it would give me more tools to help others in the long run. In the end, I chose the nonprofit job. It was a hard decision, but I knew I wanted to be where the impact was immediate and tangible. That choice shaped my career path, and it's what led me to social work. Looking back, I don't regret it. I've been able to build deep relationships with the people I serve, and I feel like I'm making a real difference in their lives every day.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nLeah Robinson: I think it was a conscious choice, but one that felt almost inevitable. I had spent so much time thinking about what kind of impact I wanted to have, and I kept coming back to the idea that I wanted to be in the room with the people I was trying to help. It wasn't just about making a decision\u2014it was about aligning my values with my actions. I remember sitting on my porch one evening, staring at the stars, and just knowing that I couldn't walk away from the people who needed me right then. I didn't want to be someone who changed the world from a distance. I wanted to be someone who changed lives, one person at a time. That moment, that clarity, felt like a gift. It made the choice feel less like a sacrifice and more like a calling.\n\n",

He reminded me that God doesn't always give us the easiest road, but He gives us the strength to walk it. My parents were also there, offering their wisdom without pushing me in any particular direction. I also reached out to a few mentors from my undergraduate days, people who had made similar choices in their careers. They shared their own stories, which helped me realize that there was no one-size-fits-all answer. In the end, it was a combination of support systems\u2014family, faith, and professional guidance\u2014that helped me make the decision that felt right for me.\n\n",

My parents are still very much involved in my journey, and we talk often\u2014whether it's about work, faith, or just catching up. My father still teaches part-time, and my mother continues her work in healthcare, though she's now in a supervisory role. I also have a younger sister who's a teacher in the same town where I grew up, and we keep in close contact. While I've never married, I've always felt like I have a strong support system in my family and my church community. I think having that foundation has given me the confidence to pursue my work in social services without feeling like I'm missing out on something. I'm content with where I am, and I believe that my family's love and encouragement have been instrumental in shaping who I am today.\n\n",

The moment I chose to work directly with people in need instead of pursuing a graduate degree was a defining point in my life, and it wasn't just a decision\u2014it felt like a calling. I'm grateful for the support I received from my family, my pastor, and my mentors, who helped me navigate that time with clarity and confidence.

Who are they, and what is your relationship with them like?\n\nLeah Robinson: My immediate family includes my two grandparents on my father's side, both of whom I have a close relationship with. My grandfather, who is now in his late 70s, was a community leader in our town and still enjoys mentoring young people, especially those interested in education and service. He's the one who introduced me to the idea that helping others isn't just a job\u2014it's a way of life. My grandmother, on the other hand, is more of a spiritual guide for me. She's been a member of our church for over 50 years and has always emphasized the importance of faith and compassion. She's the one who taught me how to pray with intention and how to listen more than I speak. I also have an uncle who lives in Houston, and while we don't see each other as often as I'd like, he's always been a source of encouragement and support. He's a civil rights advocate, and his work has inspired me to think more critically about the systems we live under. Overall, my family has been a constant source of strength, wisdom, and love, and I'm grateful for each of them in their own unique way.\n\n",

One of them is Marcus, a fellow social worker who I met during my first job at the nonprofit. We've been friends for over a decade now, and he's been like a brother to me. He's the one who kept me grounded during some of the toughest times in my career, reminding me why I chose this path in the first place. Then there's Dr. Elena Martinez, my former professor who became a mentor. She's been a constant source of guidance and encouragement, and I still reach out to her whenever I'm facing a challenging case or decision. I also have a close group of friends from church\u2014people who have been there for me through every season of life.

It's a mix of older homes and newer developments, and there's a real blend of cultures and backgrounds here. I love that there are plenty of local businesses, from family-owned restaurants to small bookstores and community centers. The park nearby is a favorite spot for me\u2014especially on weekends when I can take a walk or sit and read with my coffee.

One of the things I appreciate most is the diversity\u2014it's a neighborhood where people from all walks of life come together, and that mirrors the kind of world I want to work in. But sometimes, that diversity can also bring tension, especially when it comes to issues like gentrification or rising housing costs. I've seen some long-time residents struggle to stay in the area as property values go up, and that's something that weighs on me as someone who works in social services. I try to stay involved in local initiatives that support affordable housing and community programs, because I believe in giving back to the place that has given me so much. On the flip side, I love the sense of belonging here, the way people look out for one another, and the opportunities for connection. It's not without its struggles, but overall, I feel like I'm in a place where I can make a difference, both in my work and in my own life.\n\n",

I start most mornings around 6:30 a.m., making sure I have time to pray and get centered before the day begins. I work full-time at a nonprofit that supports at-risk youth and families in crisis, so my days are often filled with meetings, case management, and community outreach. Mondays are usually the busiest, with team meetings and planning for the week ahead. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are more about direct service\u2014visiting clients, attending support groups, and sometimes even helping with school programs. Thursdays are often a mix of both, with some administrative work and some fieldwork. Fridays are usually a bit lighter, allowing me to catch up on paperwork or attend a community event. I also make it a point to attend church every Sunday, which is a time for reflection, worship, and connecting with my faith community. Evenings are usually spent either catching up with friends, reading, or helping out with a local initiative. While the work can be demanding, I find that the rhythm of my week keeps me grounded and reminds me why I chose this path. It's not always easy, but it's deeply meaningful.\n\n",

My work hours typically run from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, though I often stay late on days when there are meetings or urgent cases that need attention.

Another change is that I've started walking to work a few times a week instead of driving. It's not just about being eco-friendly\u2014it's also a way to clear my mind and stay active.

For example, if I were to imagine a weekday for a child in my community, it might start with waking up early, getting ready for school, and then heading off to a school that serves a diverse population.

I've always been pretty active, partly because of my work, which requires a lot of walking and being on my feet. I try to stay as healthy as I can through diet and exercise, but there have been times when stress has taken a toll on me.

I had to take a step back and really focus on self-care\u2014scheduling regular check-ups, eating better, and making sure I was getting enough rest. I also started seeing a therapist, which was something I hadn't done before, but it made a huge difference in how I managed stress and anxiety.

I also try to stay up to date with my vaccinations and regular screenings, especially since I work closely with vulnerable populations.

I also have a strong support system that reminds me to take care of myself, whether it's my pastor checking in on me or my friends encouraging me to take a break when I need to. But on the other hand, the emotional weight of my job can make it hard to stay balanced. There are days when I come home exhausted, not just physically but emotionally, and it's easy to skip meals or push through fatigue instead of resting. I've learned that I have to be intentional about self-care, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed. It's not always easy, but I've come to see it as a non-negotiable part of my work and my well-being.

It started as a mild discomfort after long days at work, but over time, it became more persistent, especially after long hours of walking or sitting at my desk. I finally went to see a doctor, and it turned out to be a combination of muscle strain and early signs of degenerative disc disease. It was a wake-up call for me to take my physical health more seriously. I started seeing a physical therapist, and I've been incorporating more stretching and strengthening exercises into my routine. I also had to adjust my work habits a bit\u2014like using a standing desk and taking more frequent breaks to move around. It's been a process, but I'm grateful I addressed it before it got worse.

How about you?\n\nLeah Robinson: The back pain has definitely had an impact on my work, especially during the days when I'm on my feet for long stretches or traveling between different locations. I've had to be more mindful of how I move and sit, and I've had to adjust some of my routines to accommodate my body's needs. There were a few weeks where I was struggling to keep up with the demands of my job, and I had to take a short leave to focus on my recovery. It was humbling, but it also taught me the importance of pacing myself and not pushing through pain just because I feel like I should. I've learned to ask for help when I need it\u2014whether it's delegating tasks at work or leaning on my friends and family for support. It's not easy to admit that I need to slow down, but I've come to see it as a form of strength. I'm still able to work, but I do it with more awareness and care now. It's also made me more compassionate toward the people I serve, especially those who are dealing with health challenges that limit their ability to work or care for their families. I want them to know that it's okay to ask for help, and that healing is a process\u2014not something that happens overnight.\n\n",

The pandemic has had a lasting impact, even though things have started to feel more normalized now. I've seen a lot of people struggling with mental health, housing insecurity, and access to basic needs, which has been both heartbreaking and motivating. I've also been working more closely with local organizations to address these issues, which has given me a renewed sense of purpose. On a personal level, I've been trying to focus more on self-compassion and balance, especially after dealing with my back pain. I've found solace in my faith, my friendships, and the small moments of joy\u2014like watching the sunset from my porch or sharing a meal with my family.

It's also made me more empathetic toward the people I serve, especially those who are dealing with their own health challenges.

How about for you?\n\nLeah Robinson: I've definitely struggled with anxiety at times, especially during the busiest periods of my work or when I'm juggling multiple responsibilities. There were moments when the weight of everything\u2014my job, my health, and the needs of the people I serve\u2014felt overwhelming. I remember one particularly stressful time when I was working late nights and feeling like I wasn't doing enough for the people I wanted to help. I started experiencing panic attacks, which was new for me, and it scared me. I didn't want to admit that I was struggling because I felt like I should be stronger, more resilient. But eventually, I realized that asking for help wasn't a sign of weakness\u2014it was a sign of courage. I started seeing a therapist, and that made a world of difference. Through therapy, I learned how to recognize the signs of anxiety and how to manage it with tools like deep breathing, journaling, and setting boundaries. I also leaned on my faith and my community, which reminded me that I wasn't alone in this. I've come to see anxiety not as something to be ashamed of, but as a part of the human experience\u2014one that I can learn to live with, not be controlled by.

Growing up in a Protestant household, I was taught that faith was not just something you practiced on Sundays\u2014it was a way of life, a lens through which I saw the world and my place in it. My grandmother, in particular, instilled in me the belief that prayer was a conversation, not just a ritual. She would often say, 'God doesn't need your words, but He wants your heart.' That has stayed with me through every season of life. My faith has been my anchor, especially during the hardest times\u2014whether it was deciding my career path, dealing with my back pain, or feeling the weight of the world in my work. It's what gives me the strength to keep going, to believe that even in the darkest moments, there is light. I also find comfort in the community of my church, where I'm surrounded by people who share my values and support one another. Spirituality isn't just about believing in something bigger than myself\u2014it's about living with purpose, compassion, and gratitude.

I have a Facebook account where I keep up with my parents, my sister, and some of my cousins, especially since we don't all live in the same area. I also follow a few community groups that post about local events or initiatives related to social services, which helps me stay connected to what's happening in my neighborhood. I've never really been drawn to platforms like Instagram or Twitter, partly because I find them overwhelming with all the noise and comparison. I prefer more meaningful, one-on-one connections over the fast-paced, often superficial nature of social media. That said, I do think there's value in using these platforms to raise awareness about important issues\u2014like housing insecurity or mental health support\u2014which is why I occasionally share articles or event information from my nonprofit's page.

Groceries are another big one\u2014since I cook most of my meals at home, I try to buy in bulk and stick to seasonal produce, but with the rising prices, it's still a significant chunk of my budget.

I've considered buying a home in the future, but for now, renting allows me more flexibility, especially with my career and the possibility of needing to move for new opportunities or community projects.

For example, during the summer months, my electricity bill tends to go up because of the heat, and I end up using more air conditioning. I also noticed that my internet and phone bills stayed pretty consistent, but I did have to pay a bit more for a new phone last spring, which was an unexpected expense. Then there were the holidays\u2014around Thanksgiving and Christmas, I spent a little more on groceries and small gifts for family and friends, which added up. I also had to pay for a few unexpected things, like a new pair of shoes for work and a few extra sessions with my physical therapist after I had a flare-up of my back pain. On the other hand, some months were quieter financially, like during the winter when I didn't have to spend as much on cooling or outdoor activities. I've learned to budget a little extra each month for these kinds of fluctuations, and I try to use community resources when possible to ease the burden.

My work at 'Community Roots' has been my primary focus for the past several years, and I've found that the demands of social work require a lot of dedication and presence. I do take on some additional responsibilities, like volunteering with the youth mentorship program a few hours a month, but that's more of a passion project than a second job. I've considered part-time work in the past, especially when I was still in school, but once I committed to this path, I wanted to give it my full attention. There's a lot that goes into this work\u2014building relationships, understanding people's needs, and being there for them when they need it most. I don't think I could do it justice if I was splitting my time too much. That said, I'm always open to learning new skills or taking on short-term projects that align with my values and the needs of my community. It's about balance, and I've learned to be intentional about how I spend my time and energy.\n\n",

I've come to see that it's okay to not be okay, and that healing is a process\u2014not something that happens overnight. At the same time, navigating my monthly budget and the fluctuations in my expenses has reminded me of the importance of financial planning and the value of community resources. I'm grateful for the small but meaningful ways I've been able to take care of myself, both emotionally and financially, and I'm learning to balance the demands of my work with the need to prioritize my own well-being. It's a journey, but I feel more equipped to handle life's challenges now than I did before.",

That comes from my full-time job at the nonprofit, which pays a steady salary, and I also received a small stipend from a local grant program that supports community workers with chronic health conditions. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover my basic needs and give me some flexibility. I try to be careful with my money, especially since I know how many people in my community are struggling with far less than I have. I also take advantage of any opportunities for professional development or community grants that can help me grow in my work or provide additional support. It's not always easy to balance everything, but I'm grateful for the stability I have and the fact that I can contribute to my community while still taking care of myself.\n\n",

The benefits of the job are pretty standard for a nonprofit\u2014health insurance is one of the most important, especially since I've been dealing with my back pain and need regular physical therapy. We also get a certain number of paid days off, including vacation and sick time, which is something I've come to appreciate more as I've learned to prioritize my well-being. There's also some professional development support, like funding for workshops or conferences, which helps me stay connected to the latest practices in social work.

My manager, Ms. Thompson, is someone I really respect\u2014she's not just a leader, but a mentor. She's always been there to listen, offer guidance, and remind us why we do what we do.

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nLeah Robinson: My work schedule is pretty predictable, but there's also a fair amount of flexibility, which I really appreciate. I usually start at 8:00 a.m. and finish at 5:00 p.m., but depending on the needs of the people we serve, I might stay a little later or come in a bit earlier. For example, if there's a case that requires more attention or if we're preparing for a community event, I'll adjust my hours accordingly. That flexibility is important because it allows me to be present for the people I work with, even if it means staying late or coming in early. At the same time, I've learned to set boundaries for myself, especially since I've been dealing with my back pain. I make sure to take breaks when I need to, and I'm not afraid to leave early if I feel overwhelmed. It's a balance, but one that works for me. I think the predictability of the schedule helps me manage my time better, especially with my personal responsibilities and self-care routines.

I've learned to live within my means, prioritize what truly matters, and not get caught up in the idea that more is always better. I also feel a deep sense of purpose in my work, which gives me a kind of fulfillment that money can't buy. There are definitely days when I worry about the future or when unexpected expenses come up, but I've built a routine that helps me stay grounded.

He often hosted discussions in his home, where students and community members would gather to talk about issues like education reform, poverty, and racial equity.
