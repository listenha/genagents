            "BFI-10_1": "Based on Lisa's interview, she described herself as someone who values community service and has a network of close friends and family. Her involvement in various clubs and organizations suggests she is somewhat social, but she also emphasized the importance of maintaining privacy and balance in her life. Given her emphasis on her reserved nature and the balance she seeks, a moderate score of 3 seems most fitting. However, since she leans towards being somewhat reserved, a 2 or 3 would be appropriate, with a slight inclination towards 2 given her clear preference for quiet moments and the challenges she faces in the job search which might make her feel more reserved.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Lisa Johnson appears to be a thoughtful and empathetic person who values community service and supports various non-profit organizations. She also maintains strong connections with her family and friends, which suggests a generally trusting nature. Furthermore, her involvement in social justice causes indicates a willingness to trust others who share her values and goals. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that Lisa would lean towards the higher end of the scale, indicating she is generally trusting.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on the interview, Lisa describes herself as someone who is actively seeking employment and participating in various activities such as networking, volunteering, and maintaining a strict daily routine. She also mentions that she is trying to stay positive and focused on her goals, which suggests she is not someone who avoids effort or tasks. Her dedication to her career and community involvement indicate that she is not lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Lisa has been dealing with the stress of job searching and the uncertainty of her career path. She has mentioned experiencing anxiety and occasional bouts of depression, but she has also described implementing coping strategies like journaling and mindfulness practices. While the job search has been challenging, she has shown resilience and a willingness to adapt her approach. This suggests she is not completely relaxed and stress-free, but she is not struggling to handle stress either. Given her current situation, a moderate score of 3 seems most appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on Lisa's description, she doesn't seem to have a strong background in artistic pursuits. She mentions being involved in activism and community service but doesn't highlight any specific artistic interests. Her focus seems to be more on education, career, and helping others, which suggests she may not have many artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Lisa mentions having close friendships and participating in various community events. She also engages in social media to stay connected and finds comfort in face-to-face interactions.

            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Lisa is described as a liberal individual who is focused on making a positive impact in her community. She values community service and has taken steps to volunteer and engage in social justice causes. This suggests that she is more likely to be understanding and forgiving of others, rather than quick to find fault. Additionally, her emphasis on personal growth and learning from rejections indicates a willingness to see the positive in challenging situations. Therefore, it is more likely that Lisa would disagree with the statement of frequently finding fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on the interview, Lisa is described as someone who is focused on her career and dedicated to making a positive impact. She has mentioned taking the time to prepare for interviews, tailoring her resume and cover letters, and attending networking events. These behaviors suggest that she values thoroughness and attention to detail in her work. Additionally, her commitment to her goals and her willingness to learn from rejections indicate a thorough and persistent approach to her job search.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on Lisa's interview, she has described experiencing anxiety and stress during her job search. However, she has also mentioned strategies to manage her anxiety, such as mindfulness practices and regular exercise. This suggests that while she does experience nervousness, it is not pervasive or overwhelming. Therefore, she is more likely to choose a moderate score rather than the highest level of nervousness.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on Lisa's responses, she has shown a tendency towards engagement in activities that require creativity and critical thinking, such as her involvement in student politics, volunteering, and her commitment to economic development and social justice. These activities suggest that she is open to new ideas and enjoys engaging in imaginative and creative problem-solving. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that she would choose a higher number on this scale, indicating a more active imagination."

She has spoken about the stress and anxiety she feels, as well as the emotional support she receives from her family and friends. This suggests that she is likely able to understand and empathize with others' feelings, even if she herself is experiencing down moments. Therefore, a score of 4 or 5 seems appropriate, but given the context of the interview, a 5 better captures her empathy and ability to understand others' emotions.",

Given her active involvement in community and her connections with various groups, it suggests that she has good social awareness and likely understands the emotions of others well.

            "REI_1": "Based on Lisa's interview, she has described herself as facing challenges in her job search and dealing with the stress of finding a fulfilling career. Her mention of needing to refine her skills and prepare thoroughly for interviews suggests that she finds some level of complexity in her tasks, but it's not explicitly stated that she struggles with it. Given her proactive approach and willingness to learn and grow, it's more likely that she finds problem-solving challenging but not insurmountable.",
            "REI_2": "Based on Lisa's interview, she appears to be someone who values community service and social justice, rather than excelling in fields that require intense logical analysis. Her background in economics and her involvement in student politics and social justice causes suggest that while she may have some analytical skills, they are not her primary strengths. Furthermore, she mentions that she found her academic and professional paths challenging due to the economic downturn, which implies that she may not be particularly adept at solving complex logical problems.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview transcript, Lisa Johnson described herself as someone who has been focusing on job searching and has encountered challenges in her career path. While she is resilient and persistent, there was no indication that she particularly enjoys or excels at analytical thinking. Her descriptions suggest a more empathetic and community-focused approach to her life and work, which leans more towards the non-analytical side. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that Lisa would choose a lower number on this scale.",
            "REI_4": "Based on the interview, Lisa has described herself as someone who is resilient and persistent in her job search, but also highlights that she has been trying to implement new coping strategies and learn from rejections. This suggests she is open to learning and adapting, which indicates she is willing to reason things out carefully. However, she also mentions that it can be challenging for her to stay fully present and focused during the job search, suggesting she tends to act more instinctively in stressful situations. Given these traits, it's likely that while she values reasoning, it is not necessarily one of her strongest points.",
            "REI_5": "Based on Lisa's interview, she has experienced significant stress and uncertainty due to her job search. She described feeling anxious and overwhelmed at times, especially when facing rejections. However, she also mentioned using coping strategies like journaling and focusing on her accomplishments to manage her stress. This suggests she can handle some pressure but might struggle in very high-stress situations. Given her acknowledgment of the challenges she faces, it's reasonable to assume she would agree to some extent but not to the strongest extent possible.",
            "REI_6": "Based on Lisa's responses, she appears to be reflective and grounded in reality. She has described herself as someone who is actively looking for work and dealing with the uncertainties of unemployment. While she has shown a strong sense of purpose and determination in her career goals, there is no indication that she views herself as inherently superior in logical reasoning. Her focus seems to be more on her career aspirations and the skills she is developing through her job search and networking efforts. Therefore, it is more likely that she would place herself somewhere in the middle of the spectrum.",
            "REI_7": "Based on Lisa's description, she appears to have a strong educational background and has been involved in various intellectual pursuits like economics, student politics, and economic development work.

This indicates that she would be more aligned with option 5.",
            "REI_9": "From the interview, Lisa described herself as someone who has faced challenges in her job search and life in general. She has been trying to navigate these challenges through various means, including networking and learning from rejections. This suggests that while she may not always find logic to be her primary tool, she does recognize its value and tries to apply it in her problem-solving. Her openness to learning and adapting indicates a willingness to use logical reasoning, even if it's not her default method.",
            "REI_10": "Based on Lisa's responses, she seems to be a thoughtful and deliberate person. She discusses her career choices and life events in a considered manner, reflecting on the impacts and learning from them.
