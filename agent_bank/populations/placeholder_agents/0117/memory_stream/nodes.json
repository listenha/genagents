    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nIsabel Reyes: I was born and raised in San Francisco, though I didn't live in the same neighborhood my whole life. When I was 16, I was living in Pacific, but my family moved to a different part of the city\u2014still in California, of course. I grew up in a tight-knit household with both of my parents, who were both college-educated and worked full-time. My father was a teacher, and my mother worked in healthcare. We were never wealthy, but we were comfortable, and that gave me a solid foundation. I always knew I wanted to go to college, partly because both of my parents had bachelor's degrees and valued education. I was a pretty quiet kid, but I loved reading and writing. I remember staying up late with my mom, who would read to me before bed, and that's where my love for stories began. I went to a public high school, and though I wasn't the most outgoing person, I had a few close friends and a supportive family. After high school, I attended a local university, where I studied literature. I always thought I'd end up teaching, but life had other plans. After college, I got married to my husband, who's a software developer, and we've been working to build a life together. We have two kids, and while it's been a busy few years, I still find time to read and write, which helps me feel grounded.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nIsabel Reyes: Yes, there was a crossroads\u2014actually, two of them. The first one was right after I graduated from college. I had been studying literature, and I thought I would follow in my father's footsteps and become a teacher. But during my senior year, I took a class in creative writing, and it completely changed my perspective. I realized I didn't just want to teach literature; I wanted to create it. I had always written stories as a child, but I never thought of it as a career. That class made me see that writing could be more than a hobby\u2014it could be a way to express myself and connect with others. I had a chance to apply for a graduate program in creative writing, but I was hesitant because I didn't want to leave my husband, who was just starting his career. We had just gotten married, and we were building a life together. I remember sitting at the kitchen table, staring at the application, and feeling torn. On one hand, I felt like I was betraying my own dreams if I didn't go. On the other hand, I didn't want to uproot our family. In the end, I decided to stay in San Francisco and work a part-time job while writing on the side. It wasn't easy, but over time, I started getting published in small literary journals, and that gave me the confidence to keep going. The second crossroads came a few years later, when I was offered a full-time position as a writer for a local magazine. It was a huge opportunity, but it meant more travel and less time with my kids. Again, I had to weigh my personal life against my professional ambitions. This time, I chose to take the job, but I made sure to schedule my writing around my family's needs. Looking back, those moments taught me that life is full of choices, and sometimes the hardest ones are the ones that shape who you become.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us they made a conscious choice or decision in moments like these, while others say it 'just happened'. What about you?\n\nIsabel Reyes: I think for me, it was a combination of both\u2014conscious choices and moments that just happened. Like when I decided to stay in San Francisco after college, that was a deliberate choice, but the way my writing career unfolded after that felt more like a series of small, unexpected opportunities that added up. I remember submitting a short story to a local journal on a whim, and it got published. That gave me the confidence to keep going, even though I didn't have a plan. I think life is a mix of intention and serendipity. You make choices based on what you know at the time, but sometimes the path opens up in ways you never anticipated. I've learned to trust both the decisions I make and the moments that seem to come out of nowhere\u2014they both shape who I am.\n\n",

I think having a mentor or someone who believed in me when I wasn't sure I believed in myself would have made a huge difference. Early on, when I was writing on the side, I didn't have much of a support system. My husband was incredibly supportive, but he was focused on his own career, and I didn't have a lot of friends who understood what I was trying to do. If there had been a writing group or a community center that offered workshops or classes, that might have given me the push I needed. I remember once attending a free writing workshop at a local library, and the instructor gave me some really helpful feedback. That single interaction made me realize I wasn't alone in my struggles, and it encouraged me to keep going. So yes, I think having access to resources or people who could offer guidance during those uncertain times would have helped me navigate those crossroads with more confidence.\n\n",

My husband, Carlos, is a software developer, and we met in college\u2014though we weren't together then. We reconnected a few years after graduation, and we've been married for over a decade now. He's been my biggest supporter, especially during the times when I was trying to find my voice as a writer. Our kids are 8 and 10, and they're both in local schools. They're very creative, just like me\u2014my daughter loves drawing and writing stories, while my son is into robotics and coding. It's amazing to see them explore their own passions. Being a parent has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, but it's also been challenging. There are days when I feel like I'm juggling a million things at once, but I try to remind myself that it's all part of the journey. I wouldn't trade it for anything, even with the chaos.\n\n",

They live in the same city, though a different neighborhood, and we see them often. My father retired from teaching a few years ago, and now he volunteers at a community center, which he absolutely loves. He's always been passionate about education, and it's heartwarming to see him give back in that way. My mother is still working part-time in healthcare, though she's more focused on being there for our family now. She's always been the one who encouraged me to follow my dreams, even when I wasn't sure what they were. I think I got my love for storytelling from her\u2014she's an amazing listener and has a way of making everyone feel seen. We have a close relationship, and I know I can always count on them for support. My siblings, on the other hand, are spread out. My older brother lives in Seattle, and my younger sister is in New York. We don't get to see each other as often as I'd like, but we stay in touch through calls and visits.

One of them is Maria, who I met in college. She was in the same literature program as me, and we bonded over our love for books and writing. Even though we didn't end up in the same career paths, we've stayed close. She's a nurse now, but she's also an aspiring poet, and we often exchange poems and stories. She's been a great source of encouragement, especially when I was trying to find my way as a writer. Then there's Javier, who was my roommate during college. He's a musician, and he's always been the one to remind me to take a break and enjoy life. He's the kind of person who can make you laugh even on your worst days. I also have a few close friends from my writing group\u2014though it's not an official group, we've formed a little community of writers who meet up occasionally to share our work and support each other. These people have been like family in many ways, offering advice, laughter, and sometimes just a listening ear when I needed it most.\n\n",

It's one of those places where you can walk to cafes, parks, and even a few bookstores. I love that there's a mix of old and new here\u2014some of the buildings are historic, with beautiful architecture, while others are modern apartments with great amenities. The streets are quiet in the mornings, and there's always a sense of calm that comes with living near the water. I live in a two-story townhouse with my husband and kids. The house has a small garden where my daughter plants flowers, and my son has a little corner where he tinkers with his robotics projects. It's not huge, but it's perfect for our family. One of the things I appreciate most about this neighborhood is the sense of safety and the strong sense of community. We have a local library that hosts writing workshops, which I still attend sometimes, and there's a community center where my parents volunteer. It's a place where people look out for each other, and I feel really lucky to call it home.\n\n",

But now, living in Pacific Heights, I can walk my kids to school without worrying, and I know the neighbors look out for one another. There's a kind of quiet confidence that comes with knowing you're in a place where people care about each other. It's not just about safety, though\u2014it's about feeling seen and supported.

The biggest upside is the sense of community I mentioned before\u2014it makes all the difference, especially with two kids running around. There are days when I feel like I'm part of something bigger, like the neighborhood is almost a second family. But it's not without its challenges. The cost of living here is pretty high, and sometimes I worry about whether we're making the right financial choices for our future. I also miss the diversity of Pacific, where there were more cultural influences and a different rhythm to life. Still, I can't complain too much. The parks are beautiful, the schools are good, and there's always something happening\u2014whether it's a local art show, a food festival, or just a quiet evening walk by the water. I think the key is finding balance. I love the peace and stability this neighborhood offers, but I also know that life is about growth, and I hope my kids will have the chance to experience different places too.

A few months ago, I started experiencing some persistent back pain, which I initially dismissed as just the result of carrying my kids around or sitting at my desk for long hours while working. But one day, after a particularly busy week, I woke up with sharp pain radiating down my leg, and I realized it wasn't just strain\u2014it was a sciatic nerve issue. I made an appointment with my doctor, and after some tests, I was diagnosed with a mild herniated disc. It wasn't anything too serious, but it did require me to take a few weeks off work to rest and recover. During that time, I had to rely on my husband to take over most of the household responsibilities, which was humbling but also a reminder of how much I depend on him. I started seeing a physical therapist, and I've been doing some exercises to strengthen my core and improve my posture. It's been a slow process, but I'm feeling much better now. The experience also made me more aware of how stress and overexertion can take a toll on your body, and I've been more mindful about pacing myself and taking breaks when I need to.\n\n",

There were days when I felt frustrated or even a little helpless, especially when I couldn't do the things I normally do\u2014like picking up my kids from school or working on my writing. But honestly, it also gave me a chance to slow down and reconnect with my family in a way I hadn't before. My husband took on more responsibilities, and I found myself doing more of the things I used to put off, like cooking meals together or just sitting down for a quiet conversation. It reminded me that sometimes, when life throws you a curveball, it's not just about getting back to where you were\u2014it's about finding new ways to move forward. I'm still recovering, but I've learned that taking care of myself isn't just about being strong; it's also about knowing when to ask for help and when to rest.\n\n",

There's been a lot of growth, both personally and as a parent. I've learned to be more present, to slow down and really listen to my kids when they talk about their day, or even when they're just being silly. I've also found more peace in my writing, even if it's not as consistent as I'd like. There were moments when I felt overwhelmed, especially during the pandemic surge, when schools were closed and everything felt uncertain. But I also felt a deep sense of connection with my family, knowing we were all in this together.

When I shared about my health struggles with the herniated disc, it brought up how vulnerable it can feel to slow down and rely on others, but also how important it is to take care of myself so I can be there for my family. Reflecting on what makes it easy or hard to stay healthy, I realized that while my family and routines help me stay on track, the constant juggling of work and parenting can make it challenging to prioritize my own needs.

I didn't want to talk about it with anyone because I didn't want to burden them, but I realized I needed to find a way to take care of my mental health, too. I started talking to a therapist, which was a big step for me. It helped me understand that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and that I don't have to be perfect to be present for the people I love.

My mother was the one who really instilled that in me\u2014those quiet evenings reading the Bible before bed, the Sunday Masses we attended as a family, the way she would explain the stories and values behind them. Even now, as an adult, I find comfort in my faith. It's not just about following the rules or going to church every week\u2014it's about the sense of community, the rituals that connect me to something bigger than myself. I still go to Mass regularly, and it's a time when I can step back from the chaos of daily life and just be present. I also find solace in prayer, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed or uncertain. It's not always easy to maintain that connection, especially with the demands of work and family, but I try to make it a priority. I think faith has helped me through some of the hardest moments in my life, like when I was dealing with my health issues or feeling like I wasn't enough for my family.

I find that it can be both a connection and a distraction, and I've learned to be selective about how I engage with it. I do follow a few local writers and artists on Instagram, mostly because their work inspires me. I also have a small group of friends from college who keep in touch through Facebook, and I enjoy seeing updates about their lives, especially since we don't get to see each other as often as I'd like. That said, I tend to limit my time online, especially during the week, because I want to be fully present for my kids and my writing. There are days when I feel like I'm missing out on something, but I've come to realize that my life is already full in ways that social media can't replicate.

One of the biggest changes has been how I approach my anxiety. Instead of trying to push it away, I've started acknowledging it and giving myself permission to feel it. I've taken up journaling again, something I used to do as a child, and it's been a great way to process my thoughts and emotions.

Then there's the childcare\u2014both of my kids are in after-school programs, and we also hire a part-time babysitter a couple of times a week when we need extra help.

I also have health insurance through my freelance work, but the premiums and copays add up. On top of that, we have regular expenses like groceries, utilities, and transportation. I try to budget carefully, and we've been pretty good about sticking to our plan, but it's always a balancing act.

Typically, we hover around $6,000 to $6,200, depending on the month. The increase this time was mostly due to an unexpected repair on our townhouse's plumbing system\u2014something we hadn't budgeted for. Other than that, our usual expenses are pretty consistent: rent is about $2,500, childcare and after-school programs run around $1,200, and healthcare, including my physical therapy sessions, comes to roughly $800. Groceries are another $800 to $1,000, and we spend about $500 on utilities and transportation. We also set aside a small amount each month for savings, which has been a priority for us since we want to ensure we're financially stable for our kids' future.

On the other hand, the cost is definitely a challenge. I think we've come to terms with the fact that renting is the practical choice for now, especially with the way the real estate market is in San Francisco. We've been here for about six years, and while I've considered buying, the prices are just too high for us to feel comfortable making that leap. For now, we're focused on saving and making sure we're in a stable financial position for our kids' future. Renting allows us to stay in a neighborhood we love without the long-term commitment of a mortgage, and I think that's a smart decision for our family right now.\n\n",

Tell me all about how your bills have fluctuated over the past year.\n\nIsabel Reyes: Over the past year, our bills have had their ups and downs, depending on the season and what's going on with the kids. For example, during the school year, our childcare and after-school program costs are pretty consistent, but when school is out, we end up spending more on summer camps and activities to keep the kids occupied. Then there's the holiday season\u2014December is always the most expensive month because of gifts, holiday meals, and the extra electricity usage from heating the house. We also had a big spike in our utility bills last winter when we had to replace the old heating system in the townhouse, which wasn't covered by our insurance. On the flip side, summer tends to be a bit cheaper because we use less electricity for heating, and we sometimes save money by doing more activities at home. I've learned to track our expenses more closely, especially around these seasonal changes, and it's helped us adjust our budget accordingly.

    "content": "Going through the interview questions from 31 to 35 made me reflect on how much my emotional well-being and financial stability are intertwined with the daily rhythms of my life. Talking about my stress levels and coping strategies reminded me of how important it is to be kind to myself and to acknowledge my feelings rather than push them aside. It also brought up how much I've grown in learning to manage anxiety and find peace in small, intentional moments. When I discussed my monthly budget and expenses, it made me appreciate how much I've learned about financial responsibility and the importance of saving for both the present and the future. It's not always easy to balance everything\u2014my work, my family, my health, and my finances\u2014but I'm learning that resilience comes from being adaptable, from asking for help when needed, and from finding joy in the little things that make life meaningful. These conversations have helped me see that even in the midst of uncertainty, I have the strength and support to keep moving forward.",

That includes my freelance writing income, the small earnings from my online writing course, and the stipend I receive from the nonprofit I volunteer with. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our expenses and still set aside some money for savings. I've learned that income can be a bit unpredictable, especially with freelance work, but I try to plan ahead as much as possible. It's also comforting to know that I'm not just working for money\u2014I'm doing something I love, and that makes all the difference.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nIsabel Reyes: I don't have a single workplace in the traditional sense, since I work from home as a freelance writer and editor. But I do have a small office space in our townhouse that I've set up to be my workspace. It's not much\u2014just a desk, a couple of bookshelves, and a comfortable chair\u2014but it's my sanctuary. I've been working this way for about six years now, ever since I decided to leave the idea of a traditional 9-to-5 job behind. The benefits of this kind of work are both practical and personal. On the practical side, I have health insurance through a small business plan I set up, which covers me and my family. I also have the flexibility to take time off when I need to, whether it's for a sick day, a vacation, or just a day to recharge. I don't get paid time off in the traditional sense, but I've learned to build that into my schedule. On the personal side, the biggest benefit is being able to be present for my kids and my family. I can pick them up from school, help with homework, and still get my work done. It's not always easy, but I've found a rhythm that works for us. I think the biggest challenge is the lack of structure, but I've learned to create my own structure through routines and planning. It's not perfect, but it's a life that feels meaningful and balanced to me.\n\n",

How are your relationships with your coworkers?)\n\nIsabel Reyes: Since I work freelance, I don't have a traditional manager or boss, which is both liberating and a bit isolating at times. My relationships with clients are usually professional but also collaborative\u2014I often have ongoing projects with a few regular clients, and we build a kind of rapport over time. I enjoy the independence it gives me, but I'll admit there are days when I miss the structure of having coworkers to bounce ideas off of or just chat with during the day. That's why I've made an effort to connect with other writers in the community, whether through workshops, online groups, or even just coffee meetups. It's not the same as having a traditional office environment, but it helps me feel less alone in my work. I think the biggest thing is that I've learned to be my own manager, setting goals, meeting deadlines, and holding myself accountable. It's a different kind of relationship with work, but one that I've come to appreciate for the freedom and flexibility it offers.\n\n",

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nIsabel Reyes: My work schedule is pretty flexible, which is both a blessing and a challenge. On one hand, I love that I can set my own hours and work around my kids' schedules. For example, I often start my day early, around 6:30 a.m., when the house is quiet, and I can focus on writing without interruptions. But I also have to be disciplined about setting boundaries, because it's easy to work late into the night or take on too much at once. Some days, I might have a full day of writing and editing, while other days I might only work a few hours if I'm juggling family responsibilities or need to rest. The flexibility is great for my family life, but it does mean I have to be proactive about managing my time and staying on top of deadlines. I've learned to use tools like calendars and to-do lists to keep things organized, and I try to block out specific times for work, family, and self-care. It's not always perfect, but it's a system that works for me and helps me stay balanced.\n\n",

They both had stable jobs that allowed us to live comfortably, and they always made it a priority to support my education.

He had a way of making even the most reluctant student feel seen and valued. I remember how he would stay after class to talk to kids who were struggling, whether it was with schoolwork or personal issues. He believed that education was more than just books and tests\u2014it was about opening minds and inspiring young people to dream bigger. My mother worked as a nurse for many years, and her most important duties were caring for patients, listening to their stories, and providing comfort during difficult times. She had a deep sense of empathy, and I think that's where I got my love for storytelling. Even now, when I write, I try to capture the same kind of compassion and connection that my mother showed in her work.
