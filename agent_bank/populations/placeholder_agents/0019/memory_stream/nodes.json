    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nLuis Hernandez: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in a small town in Mexico, but my family moved to the United States when I was just a baby. We settled in Pacific, Oregon, a coastal city not too far from Eugene. My parents worked hard, but they didn't go beyond finishing elementary school, which made it challenging for them to find stable jobs. They were both working multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet, so we lived in a modest home and struggled to keep up with the costs. Despite the financial struggles, my parents instilled in me the importance of education and hard work. They often talked about the sacrifices they made to give us a better life. I remember going to school and feeling grateful for the opportunity to learn, even though our family income was far below average.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nLuis Hernandez: There was a moment in high school that really shaped who I am today. I was struggling to balance schoolwork with helping out around the house and taking care of my younger siblings. One day, my guidance counselor approached me and suggested I apply for a scholarship program that could help with college expenses. At first, I wasn't sure if I qualified or if it was worth applying, given our financial situation. But my counselor encouraged me to apply, saying that every little bit helps and that it could open doors for me. So, I decided to take the leap and applied. Much to my surprise, I was accepted into the program and received a full scholarship to a local community college. That experience taught me the importance of seizing opportunities, no matter how small they may seem. It also showed me that there are resources available if you're willing to seek them out. From that point on, I became more proactive about my education and set my sights on eventually transferring to a four-year university.\n\n",

I realized that despite the challenges we faced, there were still ways to achieve something greater. It was a reminder that no matter how difficult things might seem, there's always a way forward if you're willing to put in the effort. Since then, I've tried to stay focused on my goals and to pay it forward whenever I can.\n\n",

If someone had lent a helping hand during those times, it would have made a huge difference. My parents did what they could, but sometimes it's hard to see beyond your own immediate needs. Having someone believe in me and offer support, even in small ways, could have been a game-changer. It made me realize that there are people and organizations out there who want to help, and that knowledge has stayed with me ever since.\n\n",

The back pain I've been dealing with, especially during the pandemic, has been a constant reminder of the physical demands of caring for a young child. However, it has also pushed me to prioritize self-care and find ways to manage stress through exercise and community support. The transition to homeschooling has been both challenging and rewarding, allowing us to bond more and tailor Luis Jr.'s learning experience to his interests. While depression and anxiety have sometimes crept in, leaning on my faith, the support group I joined, and the love from my family and friends has helped me navigate these tough times. Overall, the combination of family, health, and community has made these recent changes a more manageable and rewarding experience, reinforcing the importance of finding balance and support in all aspects of life.",

The pandemic has introduced a lot of uncertainty, and balancing homeschooling Luis Jr. with our household responsibilities can be overwhelming. I've found that taking breaks, doing some yoga, and talking things over with my friends in the support group have been helpful.

The mortgage is a bit tight, but we're managing with Maria's income and my contributions. Utilities can be unpredictable, especially with the weather changing, but we try to be mindful of our usage. Groceries are a big part of our budget, and we try to stick to a list to avoid overspending. Fortunately, we've been able to save a little each month, which helps with unexpected expenses.\n\n",

The mortgage is around $900, utilities are about $200, and groceries are typically around $800. We try to save a little each month, but it's not always easy.

Summer was relatively stable, but with Luis Jr. starting daycare, we had to factor in those additional costs.

    "content": "Completing this interview and sharing my life story has been both humbling and enlightening. It's amazing to reflect on how much my family, community, and personal experiences have shaped who I am today. From the challenges of growing up in a modest household to the turning point of receiving a scholarship that changed the course of my life, every step has been a lesson in perseverance and gratitude. The support of my wife Maria, the love of my son Luis Jr., and the unwavering encouragement from my parents have been the pillars of my strength. The community around us, from the local church to the support group, has provided a safety net during tough times. While the path has been filled with ups and downs, the knowledge that I can make a difference in the lives of those around me, even in small ways, gives me a sense of purpose. This interview has reminded me of the importance of staying true to my values, supporting my family, and continuing to grow both personally and professionally. It's a journey that I'm committed to, and I'm grateful for every step of the way.",
