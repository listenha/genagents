Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMelissa Williams: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Charleston, South Carolina, in a family that had its share of challenges. My parents were both high school graduates but faced tough times after my dad lost his job during the economic downturn. They eventually divorced when I was 13, which was a significant change for our family dynamic. Despite the divorce, my mom worked hard to ensure we had a stable home. She took on various jobs, from retail to customer service, to support us. We stayed in the same state but moved to a different city, which was a bit of a culture shock for me at first. I attended a public school in Charleston and was always involved in extracurricular activities like debate and theater. These experiences helped shape my liberal views and my passion for social justice. I graduated from college with a master's degree, which allowed me to pursue a career in public policy. I've been working full-time ever since, and it's been quite fulfilling.\n\n",

I had a chance to intern with a local politician who shared my progressive views on issues like healthcare and education. It was a crossroads for me\u2014stay in the corporate world, which was a stable path, or join the political arena to push for change.

I've also been practicing gratitude, listing things I'm thankful for each night before bed. These small changes have made a big difference in managing the stress.\n\n",

Rent for our apartment in downtown Charleston is quite steep, but it's worth it for the location and the community we're a part of. Groceries are a bit of a challenge, especially with the cost of living being higher here. I try to plan meals and buy in bulk to save money. Transportation is another significant expense; I use public transit most of the time, but sometimes it's necessary to take a cab or Uber, especially when I need to attend meetings outside the city.\n\n",

We focus on cutting back on dining out and discretionary spending to stay within our budget.
