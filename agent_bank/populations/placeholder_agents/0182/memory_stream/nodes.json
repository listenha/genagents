Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nJessica Johnson: I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, and I've lived here most of my life, which has shaped a lot of who I am. Growing up, my parents were both working hard to make ends meet, and things were pretty tight financially. My parents divorced when I was around ten, and I remember that being a really tough time. I had to learn to be independent early on, and I often found myself helping out with household chores and taking care of my younger siblings when my mom was working late shifts. Education was always a priority for me, even though we didn't have a lot of resources. I worked part-time jobs through high school to help support the family, but I never let that stop me from excelling in school. I graduated high school and started working full-time right away, which has allowed me to build a stable life for myself. I'm proud of how far I've come, and I'm still figuring out what's next, but I know I've got a strong foundation to build on.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nJessica Johnson: There was definitely a crossroads for me when I was 17. I had just finished my junior year of high school, and I was working two part-time jobs to help my mom out. I was also on track to graduate early, which meant I could start college sooner. But my mom was really worried about the cost, and I felt the pressure to support the family. I remember sitting at the kitchen table one night, staring at my college application forms, and wondering if I could afford to go. I had a scholarship from a local community program, but it wasn't enough to cover everything. At the same time, my uncle, who had gone to college and was now a teacher, reached out and offered me a job as a tutor at his school. He said he believed in me and thought I could make a difference. I was torn. On one hand, I wanted to go to college and get a better future for myself. On the other hand, I didn't want to leave my mom alone, and I knew I could help her out right then. In the end, I chose to stay and work, and I tutored for two years while still finishing high school. That experience taught me a lot about responsibility, patience, and the value of education. It also showed me that I didn't need a college degree to make an impact. But I never stopped dreaming about going back to school. A few years later, I saved up enough to enroll in a community college part-time while working full-time. That decision, even though it wasn't the easy one, helped me grow into the person I am today \u2014 someone who values both education and hard work, and who knows that sometimes the right path isn't the most obvious one.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nJessica Johnson: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made lightly. I remember lying awake at night, thinking about what would happen if I left and what would happen if I stayed. I didn't want to regret not taking the chance to go to college, but I also didn't want to abandon my mom when she needed me most. In the end, I felt like I was making a choice that honored both my responsibilities and my dreams. I didn't just 'fall into' the decision \u2014 I weighed the pros and cons, talked to people I trusted, and made a plan. That experience taught me that even when life feels like it's pushing you in one direction, you can still take control and make a choice that aligns with your values. It wasn't easy, but it was mine, and that made all the difference.\n\n",

It was also my uncle who encouraged me to keep my college dreams alive, even if I had to take a different route for a while. I think it's really important for people in tough situations to know they don't have to go through it alone.

She's been through a lot, but she's strong and resilient, just like I am. I also have a younger brother who's in college, and I try to support him whenever I can, whether it's helping with expenses or just being there to listen. I don't have a partner right now because I've been focused on building my career and making sure I'm in a stable place before taking on more responsibilities. I do hope to one day find someone who shares my values and supports my goals, but for now, I'm content with where I am.

I remember him being around for the first few years, but things got complicated after the divorce, and he just kind of faded out.

I have a few cousins on my mom's side, and we keep in touch sometimes. They live in different parts of the country, but we make an effort to get together during holidays or special occasions. I also have an aunt who's pretty close to my mom, and she's been a big support system for us over the years. She's the one who helped my mom with childcare when I was working so much in high school. I'm grateful for her, because she made sure my mom didn't have to worry about everything on her own.

One of them, Tasha, I met in high school through a community service project. We bonded over our shared experiences of growing up in tough circumstances, and she's been like a sister to me ever since.

On the upside, I love the sense of community and how people here are always willing to help each other out. I've met some really great neighbors who I can count on, whether it's borrowing a cup of sugar or just having a conversation over the fence. The local park is a big part of my life \u2014 I go there almost every day to clear my head, read a book, or just sit and watch the kids play. It's a peaceful place that reminds me of the importance of slowing down and enjoying the little things. On the downside, there are definitely moments when I feel the weight of the cost of living here. Rent has gone up a bit over the years, and even with my full-time job, it's sometimes tight. I also know that not everyone in the neighborhood has the same opportunities I do, and that's something I think about a lot. I want to be part of the solution, whether it's volunteering with local youth programs or just being a voice for those who don't have one.

I work full-time at a local nonprofit that focuses on youth development, so most of my days start early \u2014 usually around 6:30 a.m. I try to get up before the kids in the neighborhood, so I can have a quiet moment with my coffee and a book.

I also make it a point to journal a few times a week \u2014 not for anything formal, but just to write down my thoughts, my goals, and the things I'm grateful for. It helps me stay focused on what's important. I also have a small garden in the back of my apartment where I grow some herbs and a few vegetables.

First, tell me all about your health.\n\nJessica Johnson: In terms of my health, I would say I'm pretty active for the most part, but I've had my share of challenges over the years. Growing up in a household where money was tight, we didn't always have access to the best healthcare or nutritious food, and I think that had an impact on me.

I started incorporating more exercise into my routine, like walking and yoga, which has helped with both my physical and mental well-being. I also try to eat as healthily as I can, even on a budget \u2014 things like cooking at home, buying seasonal produce, and making sure I get enough protein and vegetables. I've also been seeing a therapist occasionally, which has been really helpful in managing stress and staying grounded.

I also find that cooking at home, even on a budget, gives me more control over what I eat, and I've learned to make healthy meals that are both satisfying and affordable. What makes it hard, though, is the stress that comes with balancing work, family, and personal goals. There are days when I'm so busy that I skip meals or don't get enough rest, and that can take a toll on my energy and mood. I've also had to learn to be kind to myself when I slip up \u2014 like when I grab a fast-food meal on a really busy day or forget to go to the gym. I know that staying healthy isn't about being perfect, but about showing up for yourself every day, even when it's hard.

It wasn't something I was expecting \u2014 I had been dealing with some persistent lower back pain for a while, especially after long days at work and the occasional weekend volunteering. At first, I tried to push through it, thinking it was just stress or poor posture, but it started affecting my ability to walk long distances or sit for extended periods. Eventually, I made an appointment with a doctor, and after some tests, they recommended the surgery. It was a bit scary, but I knew I had to take care of it before it got worse. The recovery was tough \u2014 I had to take a few weeks off work and rely on my mom and Tasha to help me with daily tasks. But honestly, it was one of the best decisions I made. Now that I'm healed, I feel more energized and able to keep up with my routine. It also made me realize how important it is to listen to my body and not ignore the signs. I've since started incorporating more stretching and strengthening exercises into my daily walk, and I'm even thinking about trying Pilates to build better core strength.

How about you?\n\nJessica Johnson: Honestly, the surgery was a wake-up call for me. For a while, I was worried it would affect my ability to work, especially since my job involves a lot of standing and moving around with the kids. But the recovery went better than I expected, and I actually felt more motivated to take care of my body after that experience. It didn't stop me from working, and if anything, it made me more aware of how important it is to take breaks and not push myself too hard. I think the biggest challenge was adjusting to the temporary limitations \u2014 like not being able to walk as much or lift things without pain. But with the support of my mom and Tasha, I got through it. It also made me more empathetic toward the kids I work with who might be dealing with their own health issues or challenges. I want them to know that it's okay to ask for help and that taking care of yourself isn't a weakness \u2014 it's a strength.\n\n",

It's been a year of learning to balance more than ever before, especially with my work, my health, and my personal goals. I've been really proud of how I've handled the recovery from my surgery \u2014 it wasn't easy, but it taught me a lot about patience and self-care. I've also been thinking a lot about my future, and I've started looking into continuing my education again. I've enrolled in some online courses through the community college, and it's been exciting to revisit learning in a new way.

My brother is in his second year of college, and he's been managing pretty well, though he's had to take on some extra work to help with expenses. I've been trying to support him as much as I can, whether it's helping with his bills or just being there to listen when he needs to talk.

I grew up going to church with my mom, and even though we didn't go every week, the values we learned there \u2014 like kindness, forgiveness, and resilience \u2014 have stayed with me throughout my life. I think faith helps me stay grounded, especially when things feel overwhelming.

Groceries are another big one, especially since I try to eat healthily and cook at home as much as possible.

In the winter, my heating bill went up a bit, which was a challenge since I was already trying to stretch my budget as much as possible. I remember having to choose between buying a new sweater or paying the extra for heat, and I ended up getting a second blanket and wearing layers more often. Then, in the spring, when the weather got nicer, I started spending a little more on things like flowers for my apartment and a few small home improvements \u2014 like painting a room a fresh color. That was a nice way to treat myself after a tough winter. During the holidays, my expenses went up a bit more, especially when I wanted to give my mom and brother something thoughtful. I had to be careful not to overspend, so I set a strict limit for myself and focused on meaningful, affordable gifts. I also noticed that my transportation costs stayed pretty steady throughout the year, but I did save a bit when I started biking to work more often on nice days.

It was tough, but I learned a lot about time management and responsibility. Once I got the job at Bright Futures, I realized that working full-time was the right path for me \u2014 not just because it pays better, but because it allows me to focus on something that truly matters to me. I've been lucky to have a stable job that gives me the flexibility to support my family and still take care of myself. I know not everyone has that luxury, which is why I try to be as present and committed as I can be in my role \u2014 because I know how much it can mean to someone who's trying to build a better life.\n\n",

I've come to realize that taking care of my mental health isn't just about personal well-being \u2014 it also affects how I handle my responsibilities, support my family, and stay focused on my goals. It's also made me think about how important it is to be intentional with my money, not just for myself, but for the people I care about. I'm proud of the progress I've made in both areas, and I know that continuing to prioritize my health and financial planning will help me build a stronger, more stable future for myself and those I love.",

That comes from my full-time salary at Bright Futures, which covers most of the expenses, and a small part-time gig I took on at a local community center to help with weekend events. It's not a lot, but it's enough to keep things running and give me some extra flexibility. I've learned to be really careful with my money, especially since I want to make sure I can support my mom and my brother when they need it. I also try to set aside a little bit each month for unexpected expenses, just in case something comes up. It's all about balance \u2014 making sure I can take care of myself while still being there for the people I love.\n\n",

The benefits of the job are pretty standard for a nonprofit \u2014 we have health insurance, which is a huge relief, especially after my surgery. We also get paid time off, including vacation days and sick leave, which is something I used a lot during my recovery. I also really appreciate the flexibility they offer, like the ability to work remotely on certain days or adjust my schedule when needed. One of the best parts about working here is the sense of purpose \u2014 knowing that what I do every day directly impacts the kids in our community. I've seen so many of them grow into confident, capable young adults, and that gives me a lot of fulfillment. I know not everyone in nonprofits gets the same level of support, but I'm really grateful for the opportunities I've had here, and I hope to keep growing with the organization as much as I can.\n\n",

My manager, Ms. Thompson, is someone I really look up to. She's been in the nonprofit world for a long time, and she has this way of balancing leadership with empathy. She's always encouraging me to take on new challenges, but also knows when to step back and let me figure things out on my own. I think that's what makes her such a good leader \u2014 she trusts her team and believes in their potential. As for my coworkers, we have a really strong bond. We've been through a lot together \u2014 late nights, tough projects, and even some personal struggles \u2014 and that creates a sense of loyalty and understanding. We're not just coworkers; we're a team, and I feel like I can count on any of them. I think that kind of support is rare, especially in a nonprofit setting where the work can be demanding, but I'm really grateful for it.
