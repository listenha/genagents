  "agent_profile_summary": "Marcus Johnson, an 18-year-old software developer from Chicago, grew up in the Englewood neighborhood, where his mother’s resilience and dedication as a high school teacher shaped his early life. A pivotal moment came when he joined a summer STEM program at a university, which shifted his focus toward technology and inspired him to pursue a career in software development. Now working full-time at a tech company, he balances his job with volunteering at a local coding club for kids, where he mentors young students and fosters their interest in tech. His life is guided by a desire to give back, a value instilled by his mother and grandmother, while navigating the pressures of career growth and financial stability. Marcus approaches challenges with a blend of determination and humility, often reflecting on how his past informs his present choices."
