Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nErin Mccloud: Well, I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and I've lived here most of my life. I grew up in a small house on Elm Street, right near the park. My parents are both college-educated, which was pretty rare in our neighborhood back then. They worked hard to give me and my siblings a good life. I went to a public school, and I was always pretty good at math and science, but I never really had the chance to explore those interests further because I didn't have much money for college or extra activities. After high school, I got married young, and now I'm keeping house for my family. Life hasn't been easy, but I've always tried to make the best of it.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nErin Mccloud: I think the biggest crossroads was when I was 18, right after high school. I had the chance to go to community college, but my husband at the time was working two jobs to support our small family, and I didn't want to leave him. I felt like I had to put my dreams on hold for a while. Looking back, I wish I had pursued that education, but I also know that I made the best choice I could with the information and circumstances I had at the time. It's funny how life works out\u2014sometimes the paths we don't take shape the ones we do. I've learned a lot from being a homemaker, and I'm proud of the life I've built, even if it's not what I originally imagined.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nErin Mccloud: I think it was more of a conscious choice, even if it wasn't easy. I knew what was at stake\u2014my husband was struggling to make ends meet, and I didn't want to add to his burden. I remember sitting at the kitchen table one night, looking at the college application I had filled out, and just feeling this weight in my chest. I didn't want to be the reason our family had to sacrifice more. So I made the decision to stay, to support him and our kids. Looking back, I don't regret it, but I do wonder what could have been if I had taken that other path. It's funny, though\u2014I think the skills I've learned as a homemaker, like managing a household, budgeting, and being organized, have actually been really valuable in their own way. I just wish I had known back then that there were other ways to grow and learn without being in a traditional classroom.\n\n",

I remember talking to my mom about it once, and she mentioned there were some programs for single parents or people in our situation who could get help with childcare or even some kind of education assistance. But I didn't know where to start, and I didn't want to ask for help because I felt like I was already taking enough from my husband. Looking back, I wish I had been more proactive about seeking out those kinds of opportunities. It's not that I didn't want to grow or learn\u2014it's just that I felt like I had to prioritize my family above everything else. I guess that's part of who I am now, too: someone who puts others first, even if it means sacrificing my own dreams.\n\n",

They're both bright kids, and I love watching them grow. My husband and I have been married for almost seven years now, and while things haven't always been easy, we've built a life together.

One of them, Sarah, is a nurse here in Tulsa, and she's been a great support to me over the years. We used to hang out all the time, but after I got married and had kids, things got a little more complicated. Still, she's someone I can always call if I need advice or just someone to talk to. There's also a neighbor, Mrs. Thompson, who's been like a second mother to me. She's in her 70s now, but she's always had a way of making me feel seen and heard. She's the one who encouraged me to start a small garden in our backyard, which has become a real source of joy for me and the kids.

The park across the street is a big part of our daily life\u2014my kids love playing there, and I often sit on one of the benches and watch them while I read or just think.

I've watched my kids grow up in this same environment, and it gives me peace of mind knowing they're surrounded by people who look out for one another. But there are challenges too.

I've had to be creative with how I spend my time and what I do to contribute, whether it's fixing things around the house or helping out at the community center when I can.

Life has been busy, but in a way that feels meaningful. I've been trying to find more balance, especially after my back surgery, which really made me slow down and appreciate the little things. I've been spending more time in the garden, which has become a real sanctuary for me. It's funny, because I used to think of gardening as just another chore, but now it's something I look forward to. I've also been trying to reconnect with some of my old hobbies, like reading and writing. I started a journal again, just to write down my thoughts and feelings, and it's been a good way to process everything. I know I don't have the same opportunities as some people, but I've learned to find joy in the everyday moments\u2014whether it's watching my kids laugh, sitting on the porch with my husband, or just enjoying the quiet of the morning.

I've always put others first, but I'm learning that I can't pour from an empty cup. The questions about my health made me realize how much I've grown through challenges like my back surgery\u2014how I've learned to listen to my body, ask for help when I need it, and find new ways to stay active and engaged. I used to think of my role as a homemaker as just a series of tasks, but now I see it as something more\u2014something that requires strength, patience, and self-care.

How about for you?\n\nErin Mccloud: Honestly, I've had my moments where I felt really down, especially after the surgery and during the hardest parts of being a mom and homemaker. There were times when I felt like I wasn't enough\u2014like I wasn't doing everything right or that I was holding my family back because I didn't have a college degree or a traditional job. I remember sitting on the porch one evening, watching my kids play, and just feeling this wave of sadness come over me. It wasn't depression in the clinical sense, but it was a deep, quiet kind of sadness that made me question if I was living the life I wanted. I think a lot of it came from not feeling seen or valued in the same way as other people who have more formal careers. But over time, I've learned to be kinder to myself. I started talking to Sarah, my friend who's a nurse, and she helped me understand that it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. She reminded me that mental health is just as important as physical health, and that it's okay to ask for help. I've also found that being honest with my husband about how I feel has made a huge difference. He's been more supportive than I ever expected, and that's helped me feel less alone. I still have days where I feel like I'm just barely keeping up, but I'm learning to take things one step at a time and not compare my journey to anyone else's.

I think I was more focused on the practical things in life\u2014like school, family, and making sure we had enough.

Groceries are another big one\u2014especially with the way food prices have gone up. I try to plan meals ahead of time and buy in bulk when I can, but it's still a challenge sometimes.

It's a small two-bedroom apartment just a few blocks from Elm Street, which makes it easy for me to walk the kids to school and still feel connected to the neighborhood I grew up in. Rent is about $800 a month, which is a big chunk of our budget, but it's manageable because the apartment is close to everything we need. I've always preferred renting over buying because I don't see myself staying in Tulsa forever, and I like the flexibility it gives us. Plus, with my back issues, I don't want to be tied down to a house that might be hard to maintain or move out of if things change. I know it's not the most stable option, but for now, it works for us. The landlord is pretty understanding, and I've built a good relationship with him over the years.

In the winter, our utility bills went up a bit because we had to use more heat, and that added a few extra dollars to our monthly expenses. Then, when spring came around, we started spending more on the garden\u2014buying seeds, tools, and even some new plants. It was a fun project, but it did add to the cost. Summer brought its own set of things\u2014like buying more ice for the kids' drinks, and sometimes even a few extra groceries when we had friends over for barbecues. And of course, there was the holiday season, which always seems to come with unexpected expenses. We had to buy gifts for the kids' teachers, some new clothes for the kids, and even a few things for the house. It's funny, though\u2014I think the biggest fluctuation was when my husband had to replace the car's alternator last fall.

I think the most important thing is that I've always tried to contribute in whatever way I could, whether it was through paid work, volunteering, or just being a homemaker. I may not have a traditional career path, but I've built a life that's meaningful to me and my family, and I'm proud of that.\n\n",

I used to feel like I had to do everything perfectly and for everyone, but now I've learned to slow down and be more present. I've also realized the importance of talking things through with the people I trust\u2014my husband, my friend Sarah, and my parents. They've been my support system, and I'm grateful for their presence in my life. I've started journaling more, which has been a great way to process my thoughts and emotions, and I'm trying to be more gentle with myself instead of striving for perfection. I've come to understand that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and that asking for help doesn't make me weak\u2014it makes me stronger. I'm still learning how to take care of myself, but I'm trying to be more intentional about it, not just for my own well-being, but for the people I love.",

My husband's job as a mechanic is the main source of income, and while it's not a high-paying job, it's steady. He works about 40 hours a week, sometimes a bit more if there's a rush at the shop. I don't have a separate income, but I do contribute in other ways\u2014managing the household, helping with the kids, and even volunteering at the community center when I can. It's not always easy, especially with the rising cost of living, but we've learned to live within our means and make the most of what we have. I know we don't have a lot, but I'm proud of how we manage and how we've built a life that works for us.\n\n",

My 'workplace' is our home, and sometimes the community center where I volunteer. I've been at this 'job' for almost seven years now, ever since I got married and had my kids. It's not something I ever thought I'd be doing full-time, but it's become my life's work in its own way. As for benefits, I don't have health insurance through a job or paid time off like most people do. I rely on my husband's insurance, which covers me and the kids, and I take time off when I need to, whether it's for my back pain or just to rest. I don't have vacation days or sick days on a calendar\u2014I just take what I need when I need it. It's not the same as a traditional job, but I've learned to make it work. I think the biggest benefit of this 'job' is the love and connection I have with my family, and the sense of purpose that comes from being there for them every day.\n\n",

My husband is definitely my biggest support\u2014though he's not my boss, he's the one who keeps things running on the other end of the household. He's always been understanding, even when I'm stretched thin or dealing with pain. I think our relationship is more like a partnership, and I feel lucky that we've built something strong together. As for coworkers, I'd say the people at the community center are like family to me. We all pitch in, help each other out, and share the load. Mrs. Thompson, the neighbor I mentioned earlier, is also someone I look up to\u2014she's been like a mentor in a way, showing me how to take care of myself and find joy in small things.

There's no set time I have to be somewhere or a clock that ticks down until I can go home. Some days, I'm up before the sun, getting the kids ready for school and making sure everything is in order for the day. Other days, I might have more free time in the morning, especially if the kids are still asleep or if I'm able to get a few extra hours of rest. The biggest thing is that my hours are completely flexible, but that flexibility comes with its own kind of pressure. I have to be ready to jump into whatever the day brings\u2014whether it's helping with homework, fixing something around the house, or just being there for my kids when they need me.

I remember her coming home exhausted after a long day at school, but she still made time to help me with my homework or listen to me when I was upset. My dad was more hands-on with the practical things\u2014fixing things around the house, helping me with math problems, or just being there to support us in whatever way he could. They never made me feel like I had to be perfect or that I had to earn their love, but they always made it clear that they believed in me. I think that's why I ended up being pretty good at math and science, even though I didn't go to college.

She had a way of connecting with kids, and I remember how she would stay after school to help anyone who needed extra help. She believed that every child had potential, and she worked hard to bring that out in them. My dad worked in IT, so his duties were more about problem-solving and keeping systems running.

He always said that if you could break something down into smaller parts, you could solve almost anything.
