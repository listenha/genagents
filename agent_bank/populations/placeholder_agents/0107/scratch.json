  "agent_profile_summary": "Erin McCloud, an 18-year-old homemaker in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has built a life centered around her family and the tight-knit community she grew up in. Raised by college-educated parents in a stable household, she chose to put her education on hold after high school to support her husband and young children, a decision that shaped her path away from formal schooling but deepened her role as a caregiver and household manager. She finds purpose in daily routines—managing the household, tending to her garden, and volunteering at the community center—while navigating the challenges of limited financial resources and recent health issues, including a herniated disc. Though she often reflects on the opportunities she didn’t take, Erin remains grounded in her values of family, gratitude, and connection, finding meaning in the small, everyday moments that define her life."
