  "agent_profile_summary": "Aamir Desai, a 41-year-old software developer living in Edison, New Jersey, moved to the U.S. at age six and has since built a life rooted in education, family, and community. Raised in Mumbai by a father who was an engineer and a mother who was a teacher, he was instilled with a deep appreciation for learning and hard work. A pivotal moment in his life came during his sophomore year in high school when he joined the computer club, a decision that not only helped him navigate the challenges of adjusting to a new culture and language but also set him on a path to earning a bachelor’s degree in computer science and a stable career. Now married with two children, Aamir balances his professional life with a commitment to his family, ensuring they maintain their Indian heritage while thriving in their New Jersey home. He actively participates in his Muslim community, volunteers at local community centers, and prioritizes mindfulness and health through daily routines like meditation and walking with his kids. His life reflects a continuous effort to balance personal growth with family stability, shaped by the values of resilience and connection he inherited from his parents."
