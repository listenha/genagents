Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAamir Desai: I was born in Mumbai, India, but I moved to the United States when I was just six years old with my parents, who were both working professionals. My father was an engineer, and my mother was a teacher before she decided to stay home with me for a while. Life was different back then\u2014our family lived in a small apartment in a bustling neighborhood, and we didn't have much, but we were happy. My parents always emphasized the importance of education, and I remember being encouraged to read and learn from a very young age. When I was 16, we moved to Edison, New Jersey, which was a big change for me. I had to adjust to a new culture, a new school system, and a new language, but I was determined to make the best of it. I graduated high school and went on to earn my bachelor's degree in computer science from Rutgers University. I've been working full-time as a software developer for the past ten years, and I'm married to my wife, Priya, who is also from India. We have two kids, and we're trying to raise them with the values my parents taught me\u2014hard work, respect, and kindness.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAamir Desai: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped my life. After I moved to Edison at 16, I struggled a lot with the language and the cultural differences. I remember feeling isolated and unsure of myself. But then, during my sophomore year of high school, I joined the school's computer club. That was the turning point. I had always been interested in technology, and being around like-minded peers helped me gain confidence. I started learning English more seriously, and I even took extra classes after school to improve my skills. Eventually, I got into Rutgers on a scholarship, which was a huge relief for my parents. That decision to join the computer club wasn't just about academics\u2014it opened up a whole new world for me, and it's what led me to the career I have today. It taught me that sometimes, the smallest step can lead to the biggest opportunities.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nAamir Desai: I think it was a conscious choice, but one that felt almost inevitable at the time. I remember sitting in that computer club meeting, surrounded by kids who were just as curious and passionate about technology as I was. It wasn't just about the coding or the projects we worked on\u2014it was about belonging. I had spent so much time feeling like an outsider, and that club gave me a sense of purpose. I made a decision then and there to push myself harder, to not just survive but to thrive. It wasn't easy, but I knew that if I didn't take that step, I might never find my place. In a way, it was both a choice and a calling.\n\n",

In hindsight, I wish there had been more support for immigrant students in our school\u2014maybe a mentorship program or a counselor who understood the challenges of adjusting to a new culture and language. I remember one teacher, Mr. Thompson, who noticed I was struggling and offered to help me with my English. He didn't just correct my grammar; he encouraged me to think critically and express myself. That kind of support meant the world to me. I also think organizations like the local library and community centers played a role. They offered free English classes and after-school programs that helped me feel more connected. It wasn't just about academics\u2014it was about feeling seen and supported. I don't know if I would have found the computer club without that kind of encouragement, but I do know that having someone believe in me, even when I didn't believe in myself, made all the difference.\n\n",

Priya is a nurse, and she's been incredibly supportive throughout my career and personal life. She's also from Mumbai, so we share a lot of cultural ties, but we've also built our own life here in New Jersey. Our kids are bilingual, speaking both Hindi and English, and we make sure they understand their roots while also feeling at home in this country. Family is everything to me, and I try to be present for them as much as I can.

The moment I joined the computer club in high school was a conscious decision that changed the trajectory of my life, and I'm grateful for the teachers and community resources that helped me along the way. Now, as a father and husband, I strive to pass on the same values that were instilled in me, ensuring my children feel rooted in their heritage while embracing the opportunities this country offers.

My father, Ravi, is retired now but was always a strong influence in my life. He taught me the value of perseverance and problem-solving, which I carry with me in my work as a software developer. My mother, Meera, is a graduate with a master's in education, and even though she's been out of the workforce for a while, she's always been my biggest supporter. She's the one who encouraged me to read and learn from a young age, and I think that's why I've always had a passion for knowledge. We stay in touch through video calls and letters, and I visit them whenever I can. My relationship with them is deep and rooted in love and respect. They've sacrificed a lot to give me and my siblings opportunities, and I try to honor that by being the best version of myself. I also have an older sister, Anjali, who lives in Chicago. She's a teacher there, and we're very close. She's been a great role model for me, and I often talk to her about parenting and life choices. Our family is tight-knit, and even though we're spread out, we make sure to celebrate each other's milestones and support one another through life's ups and downs.\n\n",

One person who comes to mind is Sam, a close friend from high school who also joined the computer club. He and I bonded over our shared interest in technology, and even though we took different career paths\u2014Sam went into cybersecurity while I went into software development\u2014we've stayed in touch. He's been a great sounding board for me, especially when I'm facing challenges at work or in life. Then there's my colleague, Lisa, who I've worked with for the past five years. She's been a mentor of sorts, helping me navigate the corporate world and offering advice on balancing work and family. I also have a few friends from the local Muslim community here in Edison. We meet up for iftar during Ramadan and attend cultural events together. It's important to me to stay connected with people who share my values and background, but I also make an effort to be open to new friendships and perspectives.

It's a mix of families from different backgrounds, which I really appreciate. There are a lot of Indian families here, which makes it easier for us to celebrate our traditions and find familiar foods at the local grocery stores. The community is pretty tight-knit, and there are several cultural events throughout the year that bring people together. I also enjoy the convenience of being close to downtown Edison, where there are good restaurants, libraries, and even a few tech startups. It's not the most diverse area, but it's safe, and there's a real sense of belonging. I've lived here for over 15 years now, and while I still miss some of the sights and sounds of Mumbai, I've come to love the rhythm of life here.

There are neighbors who look out for each other, and it's not uncommon to see people helping one another with everything from fixing a fence to sharing a meal. The schools are good, and my kids have made friends from a variety of backgrounds, which I think is incredibly valuable for them. But there are also challenges. Sometimes, I feel like there's a lack of understanding or awareness about the cultural and religious practices of people from different backgrounds. I remember a few instances where my family was asked uncomfortable questions about our traditions, or when we were the only ones celebrating certain holidays. It can be a bit isolating at times, but I try to see it as an opportunity to educate and connect. Overall, I'm grateful for the stability and the opportunities this place has given me and my family.

Rohan, who's in third grade, has a pretty full schedule. He has soccer practice after school on Mondays and Wednesdays, and on Fridays, he joins the school's robotics club. Aisha, who's in kindergarten, has a little less going on, but she does have a weekly art class and sometimes stays after school for extra reading time.

Also, knowing that my health directly impacts my ability to be present for my family gives me a strong motivation to take care of myself.

The pandemic has had a lingering effect, even though things have returned to a more normal rhythm. I've noticed that my kids are more aware of the world around them now, especially with school being more structured and them having more access to technology. It's been both exciting and a bit overwhelming to see them grow so quickly. On a personal level, I've been trying to be more intentional with my time, whether it's spending quality moments with my family, staying active, or reflecting on my own goals. I've also been thinking a lot about the future\u2014what kind of legacy I want to leave for my children, and how I can continue to be a positive influence in my community. There have been moments of stress, especially with work deadlines and the ongoing challenges of being a parent, but I've also found a lot of joy in the small things: watching my kids laugh, sharing stories with my parents back home, and finding time to read or meditate. I think I'm in a good place, but I know there's always room for growth, and I'm learning to embrace that journey with patience and gratitude.\n\n",

At the same time, I've come to understand that maintaining my health isn't always easy\u2014there are days when stress or long hours at work make it tempting to neglect my routines. But I've learned that even small, consistent efforts\u2014like drinking more water, getting enough sleep, or stretching when I feel tension\u2014can make a big difference.

How about for you?\n\nAamir Desai: I think I've had moments where I've felt the weight of it all\u2014especially during the pandemic, when everything felt uncertain and the lines between work and home blurred. There were times when I felt overwhelmed by the pressure to provide for my family, to be a good father, and to keep up with the demands of my job. I didn't necessarily struggle with clinical depression or anxiety, but I did experience periods of stress and emotional exhaustion. I remember feeling like I was constantly running on empty, trying to do everything perfectly. What helped me was talking to Priya, who has always been my emotional anchor. She reminded me that it's okay to not be okay, and that asking for help isn't a weakness. I also started seeing a therapist for a while, which was something I hadn't considered before. It was challenging at first, but it gave me a space to process my thoughts and emotions without judgment. I've learned that mental health is just as important as physical health, and I'm more aware now of the need to take care of my mind, just like I do my body.

Being Muslim has shaped my values, my sense of community, and the way I approach both my family and my work. My faith teaches me patience, gratitude, and the importance of helping others, which are values I try to live by every day. Even though I was born in Mumbai and raised in a traditional household, I've found that practicing Islam in the U.S. has been both a source of strength and a way to connect with others in the Muslim community here. I try to maintain my spiritual practices as much as I can\u2014praying five times a day, fasting during Ramadan, and reading the Quran regularly. It's not always easy to balance these practices with the demands of work and family, but I believe that taking time for my faith helps me stay grounded. I also find comfort in the sense of belonging that comes with being part of a larger community, whether it's through attending the local mosque or participating in interfaith events. My children are growing up with an understanding of our faith, and I hope they carry that with them as they navigate their own paths in life.\n\n",

For me, the support I've needed has mostly come from my family, friends, and community. That said, there have been times when I've turned to Facebook or even LinkedIn for advice or encouragement. For example, when I was dealing with the back pain a few years ago, I joined a few online groups for people with similar issues, and it was comforting to read about others' experiences and find tips for managing the pain. I also follow some professional groups on LinkedIn where I can see what others in my field are doing, which helps me feel more connected to my career.

Rohan's soccer and robotics club fees, along with Aisha's art classes, added up to a significant chunk of our budget. We also had to cover the cost of private tutoring for Rohan in math, as his school's curriculum moves at a pace that's a bit challenging for him.

Typically, we spend between $4,500 to $4,800, depending on the timing of our kids' activities and any unexpected expenses. The majority of our spending goes toward housing, which includes our mortgage, property taxes, and insurance.

The mortgage is a regular expense, but we've been able to keep it manageable by budgeting carefully and making sure we stick to our financial goals.

For example, during the winter months, our heating bills went up significantly, and we had to be more careful with our energy usage. In the spring, we had a few unexpected repairs on the roof, which added to our expenses. Then, when summer came around, we spent more on outdoor activities for the kids, like swimming lessons and summer camps. Around the holidays, especially Diwali and Eid, we had to budget for gifts, decorations, and special meals, which can be a bit pricey. School-related costs also vary\u2014when the kids are in session, we have more expenses for school supplies, transportation, and after-school programs. But when school is out, we tend to spend more on family trips or vacations. It's been a learning curve, but we've gotten better at planning ahead and setting aside money for these seasonal changes. I think the key has been being flexible and not getting too stressed when one month is a bit pricier than others.\n\n",

These conversations have helped me see that both my emotional and financial health are essential parts of the life I'm building for my family, and I'm learning to take care of both with more awareness and care.",

That comes from my full-time salary as a software developer and Priya's income as a nurse. It's a good amount, but it's not always easy to stretch it across all our needs, especially with the kids' activities and healthcare costs. I've learned to be mindful of every dollar we spend, and we've gotten pretty good at budgeting and prioritizing what's most important. It's not about luxury\u2014it's about stability, and I think we've found a balance that works for us.

When I first started, I was a bit reserved, still adjusting to the culture and the fast-paced environment. But over time, I've built strong connections with my colleagues. My manager, Sarah, has been a great mentor\u2014she's supportive, fair, and always encourages professional growth. I respect her leadership and feel comfortable approaching her with questions or concerns. As for my coworkers, I have a good rapport with most of them. We collaborate on projects, share ideas, and even have a few lunch meetings or coffee breaks where we talk about work and life. There's a sense of camaraderie, especially during busy times when we're all working toward a common goal. That said, I don't always agree with everyone, and there have been moments of tension, especially when deadlines are tight or when there's a difference in work styles. But I think that's natural. What matters most is that I feel respected and valued, and I try to foster the same respect for others. I believe good relationships at work are built on communication, trust, and a shared sense of purpose, and I'm lucky to be in an environment where that's possible.\n\n",

My father, Ravi, was an engineer, and he worked full-time for a manufacturing company in Mumbai. He was always very dedicated to his job, and even though he didn't earn a lot, he made sure we had everything we needed.

He often came home tired but always made time to talk to us about his day, which taught me the value of perseverance and attention to detail.

His job involved a lot of on-site work, where he would oversee the assembly of machines, troubleshoot any issues that arose during production, and ensure everything met the required specifications. He also spent a lot of time in the office designing blueprints and working with clients to understand their needs. As for what he made, I don't remember the exact figures, but I know he earned a modest salary that was enough to support our family, though not much more. My mother, before she took a break from work, was employed at a private school in Mumbai where she taught middle school science. She was very passionate about her job and often brought her lessons home, which is how I developed a love for learning at an early age. Even though she wasn't working for pay during my childhood, the values she instilled in me through her dedication to education and her quiet strength have had a lasting impact on who I am today.\n\n",
