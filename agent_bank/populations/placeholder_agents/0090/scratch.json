  "agent_profile_summary": "Jeremy Holmes, 19, grew up in Charleston, South Carolina, in a working-class family where his father worked at a lumber mill and his mother was a nurse. After high school, he chose to join the Navy Reserve over attending community college, a decision that marked a turning point in his life, leading him to a structured path of military training and full-time work at a local warehouse. He balances his job, studies at community college, and military commitments with a disciplined routine, often rising early for exercise and maintaining regular contact with his supportive family, especially his grandparents, who help him stay connected to his Native American heritage. While he values stability and personal growth, he also grapples with the tension between his demanding schedule and the desire for more personal connections. His grounded, pragmatic approach to life reflects a deep commitment to building a secure future, both financially and personally."
