    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nEmily Murphy: I was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and grew up in a small, tight-knit neighborhood where everyone knew each other. My parents were both college-educated, which gave me a lot of opportunities growing up, even though we weren't super wealthy. My father worked as a teacher, and my mother was a nurse, so they always emphasized the importance of education and helping others. I was raised in a Protestant household, but I never really connected with organized religion, and by the time I was in my early twenties, I stopped identifying with any specific faith. I went to college right after high school, eventually earning a graduate degree in social work. I married my husband, James, when I was 24\u2014we met in grad school, and we've been together ever since. We both work full-time, and while we're not rolling in money, we're managing okay. Life hasn't always been easy, but I've always tried to stay positive and focused on making a difference in the lives of others, even if it's just one person at a time.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nEmily Murphy: There was definitely a crossroads moment for me, and it came right after I finished my undergraduate degree. I had been leaning toward pursuing a career in law, partly because I wanted to advocate for people in need, but also because I thought it would offer more financial stability. However, during my junior year of college, I volunteered at a local community center where I met a woman named Margaret. She was in her late sixties, had been homeless for a few years, and had a heartbreaking story about losing her job and then her home due to a medical emergency. She didn't have any family to turn to, and she was just trying to survive day to day. That experience completely shifted my perspective. I realized that while law could be a tool for change, I wanted to be on the front lines, working directly with people like Margaret. So I switched my major to social work and eventually pursued my graduate degree in that field. It wasn't an easy decision\u2014my parents were worried about the financial instability, and I had to take on a lot of debt to finish my education. But looking back, I know I made the right choice. I get to help people in a more direct and personal way, and that means more to me than any salary ever could.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nEmily Murphy: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made lightly. It felt like something pulled me toward social work after meeting Margaret. I remember sitting in my dorm room that night, staring at my law school application, and just feeling this deep sense of unease. I kept thinking about Margaret's face, the way she looked at me like I was the first person who had actually listened to her in a long time. I realized I didn't want to be someone who fought for people from a distance\u2014I wanted to be someone who sat with them, who held their hand when they needed it most. It wasn't just about changing my major; it was about changing the way I saw my purpose in life. I told my parents I was switching, and they were worried, but they also supported me in their own way. They didn't understand the path I was choosing, but they respected my decision. I think that moment was when I really started to define who I wanted to be\u2014not just as a professional, but as a person.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Do you think another person or an organization could have lent a helping hand during moments like this?\n\nEmily Murphy: Absolutely, I think I was incredibly lucky to have people in my life who believed in me, even when I wasn't sure I believed in myself. My mother, in particular, was the one who reminded me that it's okay to take a different path, even if it's not the one everyone else expects. She had always been a nurse, working long hours and sacrificing a lot for her patients, and she saw the value in what I was trying to do. She didn't have the words to explain it, but she gave me a hug and said, 'If this is what you feel called to do, then go do it.' That meant more to me than I can say. I also had a professor in my social work program, Dr. Langston, who took me under her wing. She had been in similar situations herself\u2014coming from a working-class family and fighting to get into graduate school. She didn't just teach me the theory; she showed me how to be resilient, how to listen without judgment, and how to keep going even when the system doesn't always support you. I think it's important to recognize that while we make our own choices, we don't do it in a vacuum. People around us\u2014whether they're family, mentors, or even strangers\u2014can be the ones who help us see the path we're meant to take.\n\n",

Do you have a partner, or children?\n\nEmily Murphy: Yes, I have a partner\u2014his name is James. We got married when I was 24, right after I finished my master's degree. We met in grad school, actually, during a group project for a community organizing class. He was studying public policy, and I was in social work, so we had a lot to talk about. He's the kind of person who believes in systemic change, while I tend to focus more on the individual level. But we complement each other well. We've been through a lot together\u2014long nights, financial struggles, and the occasional argument about how to best help people. But we've always stayed committed to each other and to our shared goal of making the world a better place. We don't have any children yet, but we've talked about it. James is supportive of the idea, though he's also realistic about the challenges that come with it. For now, we're focused on building a stable life together and making sure we're both growing in our careers. I think we're both still figuring out what the next chapter looks like, but I know one thing for sure: I wouldn't be where I am without him.\n\n",

My parents are both still living in Charleston, though they've downsized a bit and now live in a smaller house nearby. They've always been supportive, even when they didn't fully understand my choices. My father, Michael, is a high school teacher, and my mother, Sarah, retired a few years ago after working as a nurse for over thirty years. They've always been the kind of parents who encouraged me to follow my passions, even if it meant taking a less traditional path. My sister, Claire, is ten years younger than me, and she's a graphic designer who works remotely. She's always been more of the 'carefree' type, but I admire her creativity and how she's managed to build a life that's true to herself. We don't see each other as often as I'd like, but whenever we do, it's always a warm and comforting experience.

She passed away a few years ago, but her impact on me was profound. I keep in touch with some of the people from the community center where I met her, and we still gather for events or just to check in on each other. Then there's my friend, Lena, who's also in social work. We've been through a lot together\u2014late-night shifts, long hours, and the emotional toll of the job.

It's a mix of older homes and newer developments, and there are a lot of families here, which makes me feel like I'm part of something bigger.

People look out for each other, and there's a kind of unspoken agreement that we're all in this together. I've never had any real issues with crime, and the neighbors I've gotten to know are mostly kind and welcoming. I think safety is more about how you feel in your own skin and how connected you are to the people around you. In that way, I do feel safe here\u2014not just physically, but emotionally.

I work full-time at a local nonprofit that supports families in crisis, so my days can be long and emotionally demanding.

I also find that having a support system, whether it's James, my friends, or even my therapist, makes a big difference. They remind me to take breaks, to breathe, and to not take everything so seriously. What makes it hard, though, is the emotional weight of my job. There are days when I come home feeling drained, and it's tempting to just shut down and not take care of myself.

It was overwhelming at times, and I found myself struggling to separate work from personal life.

It made me realize how much I rely on my physical ability to do my job effectively. And with the anxiety flare-ups, it's not just about feeling tired\u2014it's about being emotionally available for the people I work with. I've had to learn to ask for help when I need it, whether that's from James, my therapist, or even taking a few days off to recharge. It's not always easy, but I've come to see it as part of the job, just like helping someone else through a tough time. I think the key is recognizing that taking care of yourself isn't selfish\u2014it's necessary, especially when you're trying to make a difference in the lives of others.\n\n",

On one hand, I've felt a deep sense of purpose in my work, especially when I've been able to make a real difference in someone's life\u2014whether it's helping a family find stable housing or just being there to listen when they're feeling overwhelmed. Those moments remind me why I chose this path, and they keep me going even on the hardest days. On the other hand, I've also felt a lot of burnout, especially with the ongoing challenges of our community and the emotional toll of seeing so much pain and struggle. I've been working on setting clearer boundaries between work and personal life, which has helped a bit, but there are still days when I feel stretched thin. I've also been dealing with some lingering anxiety, especially after the pandemic resurgence and the stress of handling so many crisis cases from home. But I've been trying to take better care of myself\u2014whether it's through yoga, reading, or just taking a few minutes to breathe when I need to.

How about for you?\n\nEmily Murphy: I think I've struggled with anxiety more than anything else, though I wouldn't say it's something I've ever officially diagnosed myself with. It's more of a constant background hum, something that flares up during particularly stressful times. I've had moments where I felt overwhelmed by the weight of everything\u2014my job, the people I work with, the challenges they face, and even the small things in my own life. There were times when I felt like I was carrying the world on my shoulders, and I didn't know how to let it go. But I've also learned that it's okay to not be okay all the time. I've started talking to my therapist more regularly, and I've found that just having someone to listen without judgment has made a huge difference. I also try to remind myself that I'm not alone in this\u2014so many people I work with have faced far worse, and yet they keep going.

Growing up in a Protestant household, I was raised with certain values and traditions, but I never really felt a connection to the church or the structured aspects of organized religion. As I got older, especially after meeting Margaret and choosing social work, I started to think more about the idea of purpose and meaning in a different way. I began to see spirituality as something more personal\u2014like the way I connect with people, the way I find meaning in small acts of kindness, or the way I feel when I'm in nature or reading a poem that touches me deeply. It's not something I talk about a lot, but I do believe in something bigger than myself, even if I can't put it into words.

I find that it can be both a distraction and a source of stress, especially with the way it can amplify negative news or comparisons. I do have a Facebook account, mostly to stay in touch with family and a few close friends, but I try to limit how much time I spend scrolling through it. I've noticed that when I do use it, it's often after a long day at work, and I end up feeling more drained than refreshed.

I think there's something about being present in the moment that social media can't really replicate.

But I've also started to develop better coping strategies. One of the biggest changes has been how I approach my anxiety. Instead of trying to push it away, I've learned to acknowledge it and give it space. I've started journaling more, which helps me process my thoughts and emotions in a way that feels safe. I also try to set aside time each week for self-reflection, whether it's through a walk in the park, a quiet cup of tea, or just sitting with my thoughts for a few minutes. I've also become more open about my struggles with James and my friends, which has made a huge difference. It's not always easy to talk about the things that weigh on me, but I've come to realize that sharing the burden makes it lighter.

We live in a two-bedroom apartment in Ashley Heights, and the rent alone takes up about a third of our combined income. Groceries are another big one\u2014since I work in social services, I try to support local food banks and community programs, but that still means buying enough food for both James and me, especially since we often have clients over for meals or community events. Transportation costs have also been a challenge, especially since I walk to work a few times a week and sometimes need to drive for client visits or volunteer work. We also have a small monthly budget for utilities, internet, and personal care items. To make ends meet, we've had to be pretty careful with our spending\u2014cooking at home instead of eating out, using public transportation when possible, and prioritizing what we need over what we want. It's not always easy, but we've learned to be resourceful and rely on each other to get through it.

The increase was mostly due to some unexpected expenses\u2014like a new air filter for the HVAC system and a few extra groceries because we had a few clients staying with us temporarily during a housing crisis. Normally, we spend around $3,000 to $3,200 a month, and that breaks down pretty consistently. Rent is always the largest chunk, followed by groceries and transportation. We also set aside a small amount each month for savings, even if it's just $50 or so. It's not much, but it helps us feel a little more secure. We've also been trying to cut back on non-essential spending, like dining out or buying new clothes, and instead focus on things that truly matter\u2014like supporting each other, staying healthy, and being present for the people we care about.

Renting has been the practical choice, especially with the way housing prices have gone up in the area. We've considered buying, but with the current market and our financial situation, it just doesn't seem feasible right now.

In the winter months, our heating bill went up quite a bit, which was a challenge since we're already stretching our budget thin. We had to be more careful about layering up and keeping the thermostat lower than usual. Then, in the spring, we had some unexpected repairs\u2014like fixing a leaky faucet and replacing the water heater, which added a few hundred dollars to our monthly expenses. Around the holidays, we also spent a bit more on groceries and small gifts for friends and family, even though we kept it simple. I think the biggest fluctuation was during the summer, when we had to cover the cost of a few community events I was organizing for the nonprofit. Those events were important for raising awareness and connecting with the community, but they also meant a few extra expenses for supplies, venue rentals, and transportation.

My days are filled with a variety of tasks, but the most important part of my job is building relationships with the people I serve.

    "content": "Going through the interview questions from 31 to 35 made me reflect on how much my stress, emotional coping strategies, and financial situation have shaped my daily life and sense of stability. Talking about my stress levels and how I've learned to acknowledge my anxiety instead of pushing it away reminded me of how important it is to be honest with myself and allow myself to feel, even when it's uncomfortable. It also made me think about how my coping strategies\u2014like journaling, self-reflection, and leaning on my support system\u2014have helped me stay grounded in a job that can be emotionally draining. Discussing my monthly budget and how we make ends meet brought up the reality of living on a tight budget, but also the ways we've learned to be resourceful and prioritize what truly matters. It's amazing how much our financial situation, emotional well-being, and daily habits are intertwined, and I'm grateful for the small but meaningful ways I've found to manage both.",

That includes my full-time salary from HopeBridge, James's income from his public policy job, and the extra income I bring in from freelance writing. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our basic needs and a little more. I think what's most important is that we're both working in fields we care about, and that gives us a sense of purpose even when the money isn't always enough. I know we're not wealthy, but we're managing, and that feels like a small victory in itself.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nEmily Murphy: I've been at HopeBridge for about three and a half years now, and it's been both a challenging and rewarding experience. The benefits of the job are pretty standard for a nonprofit\u2014health insurance is the biggest one, though it's not as comprehensive as I'd like, and we have to pay a significant portion of the premium. We get paid time off, which is something I really appreciate, especially with the emotional demands of the work. I usually take a few weeks off in the summer, and I try to use that time to recharge, whether it's by traveling, spending time with family, or just doing nothing at all. We also get sick days, which is important because there are definitely days when I need to take a step back and take care of myself. One of the things I like most about the job is that there's a strong sense of purpose here\u2014everyone is driven by the same mission to help people in need. It's not always easy, but knowing that my work makes a difference, even in small ways, keeps me going.\n\n",

How are your relationships with your coworkers?)\n\nEmily Murphy: My relationships at work are pretty much like the work itself\u2014complex, deeply human, and sometimes exhausting. I have a good relationship with my manager, Sarah, who's been with the organization for over ten years. She's someone who truly understands the weight of the work we do, and she leads with both compassion and clarity. She's never afraid to have difficult conversations, whether it's about a client's case or my own well-being. I trust her judgment, and I know she's always got my back, even when things get tough. As for my coworkers, we're a mix of people\u2014some have been here for years, others are newer to the field. We support each other in a lot of ways, especially during the really heavy times. There's a sense of camaraderie, even if we don't always agree on the best way to approach a situation. I think what binds us together is the shared understanding that we're all trying to do the right thing, even when the system doesn't always make it easy. There are definitely moments of tension, especially when we're stretched thin, but I'd say overall, the relationships at work are meaningful. They remind me why I chose this path\u2014not just for the clients, but for the people I get to stand beside every day.\n\n",

While I do have a general structure\u2014like starting at 8:30 a.m. most days\u2014there are always variables that can shift things. Some days, I might be called in early for a client emergency, or I might stay late to wrap up a case or attend a meeting. I also have to be flexible with my hours when it comes to client visits, which can happen at any time depending on their needs. That said, I do appreciate the flexibility that comes with it. It allows me to be present for the people I work with in a way that a more rigid schedule wouldn't always permit. I've learned to roll with the changes, even if it means my weekends aren't always free or my evenings aren't always predictable. It's not always easy, but I think the flexibility is worth it, especially when it means being there for someone who really needs me.\n\n",

I know we're both working in fields we care about, and that gives me a sense of purpose, but it also means we're not making the kind of money that would allow for a lot of comfort or security.

He always said that teaching was his way of making a difference, even if it didn't pay a lot.

I remember her working double shifts during my teenage years, especially when I was going through some tough times with school and personal issues. They both sacrificed a lot to give me and my sister, Claire, the opportunities they didn't have growing up. I think that's why I always felt a strong pull toward helping others\u2014it wasn't just about wanting to make a difference, but also about paying it forward for the people who had supported me when I needed it most.\n\n",

His most important activities were planning lessons, mentoring students, and being a constant presence in their lives, whether it was helping them with schoolwork or just listening when they needed someone to talk to. He had a deep passion for literature and history, and he brought that enthusiasm into the classroom every day. My mother, on the other hand, was a nurse who worked in the emergency room of a local hospital. Her most important duties were caring for patients during their most vulnerable moments, whether it was stabilizing someone after an accident or providing comfort to a family in crisis. She was known for her calm demeanor and unwavering dedication, and I remember watching her walk into the hospital each morning with a sense of purpose. Both of them worked hard not just for us, but for the people they served, and that's something I've carried with me in my own career.\n\n",

Both were public institutions, which meant they served a wide range of people, often those who couldn't afford private care or education. My father's job was more about shaping the future, while my mother's was about saving lives in the present. They didn't make a lot of money, but they gave so much of themselves to their work. I remember my mother coming home with stories about patients she had helped, and my father would talk about the students who had gone on to do great things. They never asked for much in return, just the chance to make a difference. That's something I've always admired about them, and it's part of why I chose to go into social work.
