  "agent_profile_summary": "Alyssa Coleman, a 21-year-old social worker in Atlanta, grew up in a single-parent household where her mother’s resilience and hard work shaped her early understanding of responsibility and perseverance. Her life took a clear turn during her sophomore year of high school when she accepted a summer internship at a nonprofit focused on youth development, a decision that solidified her commitment to helping others and led her to pursue a career in social work. Today, she balances a full-time job at the same organization with community involvement, volunteering, and efforts to build financial stability. Her work revolves around supporting young people, a role she approaches with a deep sense of purpose and connection. Navigating the demands of her job, personal growth, and financial challenges, Alyssa remains grounded in the values of community, resilience, and the belief that small acts of support can make a lasting difference."
