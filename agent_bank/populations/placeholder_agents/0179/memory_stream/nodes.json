Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMichael Romero: Well, I was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, and I've spent most of my life in the Middle Atlantic region. I grew up in a close-knit Italian-American family, and my parents always emphasized the importance of education and hard work. My father worked as a mechanic, and my mother was a school administrator\u2014both had only high school degrees, but they were determined to give me and my siblings every opportunity. I remember my mother always saying, 'If you work hard, you can achieve anything.' I took that to heart. I was the first in my family to go to college, and I earned a bachelor's degree in business administration. I've been working full time ever since, and while I've never married or had children, I've always stayed connected to my roots\u2014whether it's through my faith as a Catholic or my love for Italian food and language. I still live in Hoboken, though I've moved around a bit within the state over the years. Life has been good, and I feel lucky to have had the opportunities I've had.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMichael Romero: Yes, there was definitely a crossroads. I was about 22, right after I graduated from college with my bachelor's in business administration. I had two main options: take a job at a local bank in Hoboken or move to Chicago to work for a startup that was expanding. The bank job was stable, safe, and close to home, which made sense given my family's expectations. But the startup offered a chance to be part of something new, something innovative. I was torn because I didn't want to disappoint my parents, but I also felt like I needed to take a risk to find my own path. In the end, I chose the startup. It was a tough decision, and I remember telling my mom, 'I know this is scary, but I have to try.' That experience taught me a lot about resilience, adaptability, and the importance of trusting my instincts. It also helped me realize that while family support is crucial, sometimes you have to carve your own way. That choice ultimately shaped who I am today\u2014more independent, more confident, and more open to change.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nMichael Romero: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made lightly. I spent weeks talking to my parents, my friends, and even a few mentors I had from college. I weighed the pros and cons of each path, and I knew that if I stayed in Hoboken, I'd be comfortable, but maybe not challenged. I wanted more than comfort\u2014I wanted to grow. So I made the decision to take the risk, and I told myself that if it didn't work out, I could always come back. In a way, it felt like a test of my own courage. I didn't just choose the startup; I chose to believe in myself, and that belief has stayed with me ever since.\n\n",

My mother was incredibly supportive, but she also wanted stability for me. I remember talking to a professor from college who had taken a similar risk when he left his hometown to work in tech. He shared his story with me, and it gave me the confidence to see that taking a leap wasn't just reckless\u2014it could be transformative. I also reached out to a few friends who had worked in startups, and their insights helped me understand what I was getting into. In the end, while I made the choice myself, I don't think I would have had the clarity or courage without those conversations. It's a reminder that even when we feel like we're on our own, there are people and resources out there who can help guide us through tough decisions.\n\n",

I've never married, though I've had a few meaningful relationships over the years. I always valued connection and companionship, but I also found that my career and personal goals often took precedence. I've never felt the need to rush into a relationship or settle for something that didn't feel right. My family is still very important to me\u2014my parents are in their late 60s now, and I make it a point to visit them often, especially during holidays or big family events. I also have a younger sister who lives in Philadelphia, and we stay in touch regularly. While I don't have a partner right now, I don't see that as a lack\u2014it's more of a choice. I enjoy my independence, and I like the freedom to focus on my work, my hobbies, and my community. I'm involved with a few local Catholic organizations, and I find that volunteering and staying connected to my faith gives me a sense of purpose that I really value.\n\n",

I'm grateful for the people who helped me see the possibilities, and I'm proud of the person I've become through it all.

My brothers, both of whom are married with children now, have always been supportive of my decisions, even when they didn't fully understand them.

Are there people outside of your family who are important to you?\n\nMichael Romero: Outside of my family, there are a few friends who have been important to me over the years. One of them is Antonio, a childhood friend from Hoboken who also left the area for opportunities in Chicago. We reconnected when I moved there, and we've been close ever since. He's a graphic designer, and he's always been the creative counterbalance to my more analytical side. We've been through a lot together\u2014late-night talks, career changes, even a few bad decisions. I think friendship is about showing up for each other, and Antonio has always done that. There's also a group of coworkers from the startup I joined back in my 20s who I still keep in touch with. We don't see each other as often as we'd like, but we have a strong bond from those early days of building something from nothing. As for romantic partners, I've had a few meaningful relationships, but none that I felt were the right fit for the long term.

It's a mix of older brick buildings and newer apartments, with a lot of small businesses and restaurants that give the area a real sense of community. I live in a two-bedroom apartment on the second floor of a building that's been around for decades. The building has a lot of character\u2014original hardwood floors, high ceilings, and a small courtyard in the back where a few of the residents gather for coffee or just to chat. I love the proximity to the river; it's a peaceful place to walk in the mornings, and I often sit there with my coffee and just watch the boats go by. Hoboken has changed a lot over the years, becoming more diverse and more vibrant, but I still feel like I'm part of the same community I grew up in. There's a strong sense of history here, and I appreciate that. I also enjoy the walkability of the neighborhood\u2014most of the shops, cafes, and even the local library are within a 10-minute walk. It's not the most exciting place in the world, but it's comfortable, and I've built a life here that feels meaningful to me.\n\n",

I've never had any issues with crime or safety, and I think that's partly because of the way people look out for each other. If someone is walking alone at night, you can usually count on someone from the neighborhood to be around. I also appreciate how the local police department works closely with the community, holding regular meetings and being approachable. It's not just about the absence of danger\u2014it's about the presence of care and connection. That makes me feel secure, not just in my home, but in the people who live around me.\n\n",

Tell me about what it\u2019s been like for you living here.\n\nMichael Romero: Living here in Hoboken has definitely had its ups and downs, just like anywhere else. On the upside, I love the sense of community and the way people know each other. It's not uncommon to see neighbors waving or stopping by to check in, especially during the holidays or when someone's having a tough time. The location is also a big plus\u2014being close to Manhattan means I have access to cultural events, job opportunities, and a vibrant nightlife without having to live in the city itself. But there are downsides too. The cost of living has gone up significantly over the years, and while I'm doing okay financially, it's not always easy to keep up with rent and maintenance. There's also the occasional frustration with the slower pace of change\u2014sometimes I feel like the city is stuck in a time capsule, and I wonder if it will ever fully embrace the diversity and innovation that's happening elsewhere. Still, I've made peace with it. I've built a life here, and I've come to appreciate the quiet stability and the familiar rhythms of Hoboken. It's not perfect, but it's home.\n\n",

I work full time as a business analyst for a mid-sized company, so most of my days start around 8 a.m. I usually have a quick breakfast\u2014something simple like coffee and a croissant from the bakery down the street\u2014then head into the office.

On weekends, I like to slow down. I might attend a Mass at the local church, volunteer at the food pantry, or just spend time reading or cooking. I've gotten pretty good at making Italian dishes\u2014my nonna's lasagna recipe is one of my favorites. I also enjoy going to the library or browsing the local bookstores.

These things aren't just about health; they're about grounding myself and staying connected to what matters.

In the end, I see my health as part of the bigger picture\u2014something I need to take care of so I can continue doing the things I love, like volunteering, spending time with family, and staying active in my community.\n\n",

I've been reflecting a lot on where I am and how far I've come, especially as I've reached the age of 40. It's interesting how time passes, and how the choices I made in my 20s have shaped the person I am today. I've been more intentional about my health, which has given me a greater sense of control over my well-being. I've also found joy in the small things\u2014like tending to my balcony garden, cooking meals for friends, or just sitting by the river with a good book. Professionally, I've been in a good place at work, and I feel like I've found a balance between my career and my personal life. I've also been more involved in my community, whether it's through volunteering or attending events at the church. There have been challenges, of course\u2014like the occasional loneliness that comes with being single and childless\u2014but I've come to see those moments as reminders of the freedom and independence I've chosen.

It's a reminder that even in the simplest of ways, we can find joy and fulfillment. At the same time, I've come to understand that staying healthy isn't just about physical fitness\u2014it's about making consistent choices that support my body and mind, like eating well, moving regularly, and taking time for reflection. I've also learned that it's okay to struggle with consistency, and that the support of friends and family plays a vital role in keeping me on track. My hypertension and back pain are reminders that health is something I need to take seriously, and I'm grateful for the small improvements I've made over the past year. These changes, while not dramatic, have helped me feel more in control of my life and more connected to the values that have always guided me.",

My mother has been more involved with her church group, which brings her joy, and my father has taken up woodworking as a hobby\u2014something he always wanted to try but never had the time for. I see them a few times a month, and even though we don't live close, we make it a point to have meaningful conversations, whether it's about their lives, my work, or just catching up on the latest news. My sister, who lives in Philadelphia, has been going through a bit of a career transition, and I've been there for her through that. We've had some deep talks about what we want from life and how we're both figuring out what comes next.

Groceries come next, averaging around $600, especially since I've been cooking more at home and trying to eat healthier.

For example, during the winter months, my heating bill tends to go up a bit, and I also spend more on groceries since I'm cooking more at home and trying to eat seasonally. I also noticed that my car maintenance costs increased a little last spring when I had to replace the brakes, which was an unexpected expense. On the other hand, during the summer, I spend a bit more on outdoor activities\u2014like buying plants for my balcony garden or going to the park more often.

I've also come to appreciate that my choice to limit my use of social media isn't a lack of connection, but a conscious decision to prioritize meaningful, in-person relationships over the noise of the digital world. My family, friends, and community continue to be the foundation of my life, and I'm grateful for the stability and support they provide. It's a reminder that while life has its challenges, the choices I've made\u2014about work, money, and connection\u2014have helped me build a life that feels meaningful, secure, and deeply rooted in the values that have always guided me.",

I work full time as a business analyst, and while it's not a high-paying job, it's stable and allows me to live comfortably in Hoboken. I've always been careful with my money, and I think that's one of the reasons I've been able to maintain a good quality of life without the stress of financial instability. I also have some income from a small side project I started a few years back\u2014writing articles for a local Catholic magazine. It's not a major source of income, but it gives me a sense of purpose and allows me to share my faith and values with others. I try to live within my means, and I've always believed that having a steady income, even if it's not extravagant, is more than enough to build a meaningful life.\n\n",

The company provides a good benefits package, including health insurance, dental, and vision coverage, which is something I'm grateful for, especially as I've gotten older and more aware of the importance of regular check-ups and preventive care. We also get a standard amount of paid time off\u2014about three weeks of vacation, plus sick days and holidays. I've always valued the flexibility that comes with this, because it allows me to take time for family, my faith, and my community without worrying about losing pay. One of the things I like most about the workplace is the culture\u2014it's professional but not overly rigid, and there's a real emphasis on teamwork and collaboration. I've had the chance to work with some great people over the years, and I think that's one of the reasons I've been able to stay in this role for so long.

I've always believed in building trust and mutual respect, and I think that's something that comes through in how I interact with my manager and coworkers. My manager is someone I respect a lot\u2014she's been with the company for over 20 years, and she has a deep understanding of the industry. She's supportive, gives clear direction when needed, and she's always been open to hearing my ideas. I think that's one of the reasons I've been able to grow in my role over the years.

We work well together, and while we're all focused on getting the job done, there's a sense of camaraderie that makes the workplace feel like a team rather than just a group of people doing their jobs.

The company allows for some remote work, especially when needed, which I appreciate because it gives me the option to work from home if I need to rest or take care of something personal.

My father's job was demanding\u2014he often worked long hours, especially during the winter months when car maintenance was at its peak.

He was a hands-on kind of guy, always getting his hands dirty, and he had a real knack for figuring out what was wrong with a car just by listening to it.
