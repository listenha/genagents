  "agent_profile_summary": "Shane O'Donnell, a 31-year-old from Portland, Oregon, grew up in a working-class Irish-American household where his mother pursued a graduate degree while working part-time, and his father held a steady engineering job. After community college, he chose sociology as his major, a decision shaped by a pivotal sophomore year when he shadowed social workers, teachers, and nonprofit organizers, ultimately committing to a career in social work. Now unemployed and navigating the challenges of job searching, Shane lives in Old Town Portland, a vibrant but isolating neighborhood where he struggles to build connections. He values personal growth and meaningful work, often reflecting on his search for purpose and the tension between self-reliance and the need for support. His thoughts are marked by a desire to make a difference, yet he grapples with feelings of isolation and uncertainty, striving to rebuild relationships and find stability in both his career and life."
