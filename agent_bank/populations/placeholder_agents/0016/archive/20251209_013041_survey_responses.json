          "raw_responses": {
            "BFI-10_1": "Based on Shane's interview, he describes himself as feeling isolated and lacking strong social connections. He mentions not having many close friends or family members nearby and focusing on his career and personal development. This suggests that Shane is more introverted and prefers to keep to himself, which aligns more with choosing a lower number on the scale.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on Shane's interview, he seems to value personal growth, meaningful work, and strong relationships. His desire for deeper connections and willingness to reach out for support suggests he is open to trusting others. However, his recent struggles with job searching and financial instability have led to some stress and uncertainty, which might make him slightly more cautious. Overall, he leans towards being trusting but not overly so.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Shane's description, he appears to be someone who is actively job searching and engaging in personal development. Although he faces challenges and frustrations, his actions suggest that he is trying to push through and find a fulfilling career. This indicates that he is not someone who sees himself as lazy, but rather as someone who is actively working towards his goals despite the difficulties. While he does mention moments of frustration and feeling overwhelmed, his overall behavior and aspirations point towards a more proactive mindset.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Shane has expressed that he struggles with feelings of depression and anxiety, especially during his job search. He has also mentioned that his stress levels have been high over the past few months. This indicates that he does not see himself as someone who handles stress well or feels relaxed. Therefore, he is more likely to choose a lower number on the scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on Shane's interview, he seems to have a more practical and focused mindset. He has been emphasizing his career search and personal development, and he hasn't mentioned any particular artistic interests. His focus on job applications and his lack of mention of any hobbies that might be considered artistic suggest he falls towards the lower end of the spectrum.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Shane mentions that he hasn't had many close friends outside of his college days and has been focusing on his career and personal growth. He also states that he hasn't maintained close connections and feels isolated. These statements suggest that he does not see himself as very outgoing or sociable.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on Shane's reflections, he describes himself as someone who is trying to find a balance and make positive changes in his life. His emphasis on personal growth and forming meaningful connections suggests that he is more inclined to be understanding and empathetic rather than critical of others. He also mentions the importance of seeking support and building connections, which implies a desire to foster positive relationships rather than finding faults.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on Shane's background, he appears to be a thoughtful individual who values meaningful work and personal growth. His pursuit of a career in social work suggests a commitment to thoroughness and a desire to make a positive impact. While he has faced challenges and uncertainties in his job search, his dedication to finding a fulfilling career and his emphasis on personal growth indicate that he likely sees himself as someone who does a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on Shane's interview, he has expressed feelings of depression and anxiety, especially during his job search and when facing uncertainty. This suggests that he is likely to experience nervousness regularly. However, Shane also mentions trying to cope with these feelings through mindfulness and meditation, indicating some level of self-awareness and perhaps a moderate ability to manage his nervousness. Given his struggles, but also his efforts to manage them, a middle range score seems appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on Shane's interview, he seems to value practical and factual information, such as his focus on job applications and his current struggles with finding a stable career. He also mentions that he prefers to think for himself and form his own opinions rather than relying on religious or spiritual practices, indicating a more pragmatic mindset. These traits suggest that Shane would lean more towards choosing a lower number on the scale."

          "raw_responses": {
            "BES-A_1": "From Shane's description, he has a desire to form meaningful connections and values personal growth. His comments about wanting to build closer relationships with family and friends suggest he cares deeply about his social interactions. This aligns more with someone who would choose 5, as he shows a willingness to engage and support others.",
            "BES-A_2": "Based on the interview, Shane has been focusing on his career and personal development, which suggests he might be more analytical and focused on practical matters. He also mentioned that he hasn't had many close friends outside of his college days and hasn't been able to maintain those relationships. This indicates that he might have a harder time picking up on his friends' emotional states, especially signs of fear. Therefore, it's likely that Shane would choose 5.",
            "BES-A_3": "Based on Shane's interview, he has experienced significant stress and uncertainty, leading to feelings of depression and anxiety. He mentions that sometimes he uses social media to find emotional support and talks about the emotional toll of his job search. This suggests that Shane is capable of understanding and relating to others' feelings, even if he faces his own struggles. Therefore, he is more likely to choose a higher number on this scale.",
            "BES-A_4": "Based on Shane's description, he mentions that he hasn't maintained close relationships and feels somewhat isolated. This suggests he may have trouble picking up on his friends' emotions. However, he does value personal connections and would likely try to be observant if he cared about his friends. Given that he's looking to form stronger connections, he probably has some interest in understanding his friends' emotional states, even if he hasn't been as adept at it in the past.",
            "BES-A_5": "Based on Shane's description, he is someone who focuses on personal growth and values meaningful work in social services. While he mentions that he struggles with depression and anxiety, and turns to social media for emotional support, it does not indicate a high level of empathy or keen observational skills. His focus on job searching and personal development suggests that he might be more introspective and analytical rather than naturally perceptive of others' emotions.",
            "BES-A_6": "Based on Shane's openness about his struggles with depression and anxiety, it suggests that he might find it challenging to consistently and accurately read the emotions of others. Given his description of feeling overwhelmed and sometimes depressed, it indicates that he might not be particularly skilled at picking up on the subtle signs of cheerfulness in others. However, he does mention that he tries to stay positive and hopeful, which hints at a basic ability to recognize positive emotions. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems most fitting.",
            "BES-A_7": "Based on Shane's description, he is someone who values personal growth and meaningful relationships. His struggles with forming deep connections and his recognition of the importance of seeking support suggest he is likely attuned to the emotions of others, although he may not always have the easiest time building those connections. Given his focus on social work and his desire for meaningful relationships, it is reasonable to assume he would rate himself higher on this scale.",
            "BES-A_8": "Based on Shane's description, he has struggled with forming close relationships and maintaining a social network. This suggests that he might not be as attuned to his friends' feelings. Furthermore, Shane mentions that he hasn't been in close contact with many friends from college and hasn't made new ones since moving to Portland. This indicates that he may not regularly engage in the type of interactions that require deep emotional awareness of others.",
            "BES-A_9": "Based on the interview, Shane has struggled with forming deep, meaningful connections with others. He mentions that he hasn't maintained close friendships since college and has only recently started thinking about reconnecting with them. This suggests that he might have difficulty reading emotions and understanding when his friends are happy. Furthermore, Shane describes feeling isolated and lacking a strong social network, which aligns with the characteristics of someone who would choose a lower number on this scale."

            "REI_1": "Based on Shane's description, he is currently facing significant challenges in his job search and personal development. His struggles with finding a stable career and managing his mental health suggest that he might not feel confident in his problem-solving abilities, especially in complex situations. Given his current difficulties, it is reasonable to assume that he would lean towards agreeing with this statement.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview transcript, Shane describes himself as extremely liberal and mentions that he's been struggling with finding a stable career and maintaining social connections. His current situation is marked by uncertainty and stress, which suggests that he might not feel confident in his problem-solving abilities, especially under pressure. Additionally, Shane's experience of job searching and his current state of unemployment might indicate that he finds complex tasks, including logical analyses, challenging and overwhelming.",
            "REI_3": "Based on Shane's description, he seems more focused on personal growth, meaningful work, and relationships rather than detailed analytical tasks. He values personal development and seems to be more introspective and emotional in his thinking, which suggests he would likely rate himself lower on the analytical thinking scale.",
            "REI_4": "Based on Shane's interview, he seems to be someone who values personal growth and meaningful work, and has experienced a lot of uncertainty and stress in his current situation. His struggles with job searching and his recognition of the need to find healthier coping mechanisms suggest that he might lean towards valuing careful reasoning, but he also appears to be someone who is willing to take risks and make decisions without extensive deliberation. Given his current chaotic and uncertain life, he might be more prone to making decisions based on intuition and experience rather than careful reasoning.",
            "REI_5": "Based on Shane's description, he has experienced significant stress and uncertainty in his job search and personal life. He has mentioned feeling overwhelmed and struggling with anxiety, indicating that he likely finds it challenging to reason well under pressure. Shane's experiences with job searching and the general stress of his current situation suggest he would lean towards the higher end of the scale.",
            "REI_6": "Shane has shown a focus on academic and professional development, particularly in his choice to study sociology and pursue a career in social work. However, he has also expressed feelings of frustration and anxiety due to his current job search and lack of stability. While he values personal growth and meaningful work, there is no indication that he considers himself exceptionally good at logical reasoning compared to others. His self-description suggests a more balanced perspective rather than overconfidence in his logical abilities.",
            "REI_7": "Based on Shane's interview, he describes himself as extremely liberal politically and states that he loves learning about society and how people interact, which suggests he values analytical thinking and critical reasoning. Additionally, his interest in sociology and his pursuit of a career in social work indicate that he values logic and analysis in his work and personal life.",
            "REI_8": "Based on Shane's interview, he describes himself as someone who has been contemplating his future for a long time and who found clarity and inspiration through thoughtful reflection. He mentions that he had been thinking about his future for a long time before making a decision to pursue social work. This indicates that Shane is capable of thinking things through carefully, even if he sometimes feels lost in the process. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that he would lean towards the higher end of the scale.",
            "REI_9": "Based on Shane's description, he seems to value and appreciate logical thinking, especially in his academic and professional pursuits. He studied sociology and found passion in learning about society and how people interact, which suggests a natural inclination towards analytical and logical thinking. Moreover, his current focus on job searching and career development implies a preference for structured and logical approaches to problem-solving. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that Shane would lean towards the higher end of the scale.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Shane O'Donnell describes his journey as one filled with uncertainty and moments of confusion. He mentions feeling lost and unsure about his future, and he sometimes feels overwhelmed by the stress of job searching and the lack of a stable routine. This suggests that he does not always have clear, explainable reasons for his decisions, especially during times of high stress or uncertainty."
