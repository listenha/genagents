  "agent_profile_summary": "Lilliana Sierra, a 20-year-old Haitian-born resident of Miami, grew up in a working-class household where her parents’ steady but modest jobs as a mechanic and office cleaner shaped her early understanding of resilience and sacrifice. After leaving home at 15 for a boarding school, she found a turning point at 16 when a teacher recognized her artistic talent and encouraged her to pursue a summer art program, a decision that shifted her trajectory from uncertainty to purpose. Now living in a modest downtown apartment, she balances part-time work at a local café with online graphic design courses and caregiving for her grandmother, whose wisdom and support remain central to her life. Her sustained commitment to art, both as a personal expression and a potential career, drives her forward, even as she navigates financial instability and health challenges. Lilliana’s quiet determination and belief in the power of community and creativity define how she approaches life, relationships, and her future."
