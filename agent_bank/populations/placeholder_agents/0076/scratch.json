  "agent_profile_summary": "Monica Patel, a 26-year-old senior policy analyst in San Francisco, grew up in a suburban area of the city, raised by immigrant parents who emphasized education and community service. Her decision to pursue a career in public policy solidified during her sophomore year in college, when she interned at a non-profit focused on underprivileged communities, shifting her focus from academic research to direct social impact. Now married to Alex, a fellow public policy professional, she lives in the Mission District, where she balances her demanding job with volunteering, community engagement, and planning for a future family. Her life is shaped by a commitment to social justice, a strong support network, and a mindful approach to health and well-being, all of which influence her thoughtful, collaborative, and mission-driven interactions with others."
