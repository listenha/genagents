Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAngel Gonzalez: Well, I was born in Miami, Florida, and I've lived here my whole life. Growing up, my parents both had Bachelor's degrees, so they always encouraged me to value education. We lived in a modest house on the South Atlantic coast, and I remember my childhood being pretty typical\u2014playing with friends, going to school, and helping out around the house when I could. My mom was a stay-at-home mom, and my dad worked in construction. We weren't rich, but we had everything we needed. I was always a good student, but I didn't have a clear path after high school. I ended up working part-time at a local store while I figured things out, and I'm still trying to decide what I want to do next. I'm Catholic, and that's been a big part of my life\u2014going to church every Sunday and celebrating traditions with my family. I speak Spanish at home, which I'm proud of, even though I don't use it as much as I'd like. Life hasn't been too dramatic, but I'm grateful for the stability I've had and the support of my family.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAngel Gonzalez: Hmm, thinking about it, there was a moment that felt like a crossroads. I was about 18, right after I graduated high school. I had a few options: I could go to college, but I wasn't sure what I wanted to study, and I didn't want to take on student debt. I could also try to get a full-time job, but I wasn't ready to commit to that either. I remember talking to my dad one night after he came home from work. He told me, 'Angel, life is like a construction site\u2014sometimes you have to lay the foundation before you can build something real.' That stuck with me. I decided to take a gap year, work part-time, and explore my interests. I started volunteering at a community center, which opened my eyes to the importance of helping others. That experience made me realize I wanted to pursue something in social work or community development. It wasn't an easy decision, but it was the right one for me. I feel like that moment shaped who I am today\u2014more grounded, more aware of the world around me, and more determined to make a difference in my own way.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nAngel Gonzalez: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made all at once. It felt more like a series of small decisions that added up. After that conversation with my dad, I started reflecting more on what I wanted my life to look like. I didn't want to just follow someone else's path, but I also didn't want to be aimless. So I made a plan to work part-time, save some money, and take some online courses to see what interested me. That was a conscious step. Then, when I volunteered at the community center, I realized how much I enjoyed helping others, and that was another decision\u2014choosing to pursue that path instead of something more traditional. I think it was a mix of intention and experience. I made the choice, but the experience shaped how I understood that choice.\n\n",

When I was trying to figure out my next step after high school, I didn't really know where to start. I remember talking to a teacher at my high school, Mrs. Delgado, who noticed I was struggling with direction. She suggested I look into some local community programs and even connected me with a mentor who had worked in social services. That mentor, Mr. Ramirez, became a real influence on me. He shared his own story of starting out in a similar place and helped me see that it was okay not to have everything figured out right away. I wish I had reached out more to people like that earlier. Sometimes, we think we have to figure things out on our own, but having someone who believes in you and can offer perspective can make all the difference.\n\n",

They've been my biggest supporters throughout my life, and I still live with them in the same house on Elm Street where I grew up. My mom, she's always been the heart of our family\u2014she cooks all our meals, keeps the house running, and makes sure we're all on the same page. My dad, he's the kind of person who works hard and doesn't complain, even when things get tough. I see a lot of myself in him, especially his work ethic. I don't have a partner right now because I've been focused on figuring out my path and making sure I'm ready for a serious relationship. I want someone who shares my values, who's kind, and who's also looking for something meaningful in life. I think I'm getting there, but for now, I'm content with where I am and the support of my family.\n\n",

He's the kind of person who always knows how to make me laugh, even when I'm feeling down.

He's more of a free spirit than I am, but I respect his passion and creativity. Then there's Jasmine, who I met through the community center. She's a few years older than me and works as a social worker. She's been a great mentor and friend\u2014someone I can talk to when I'm unsure about my path. She's the one who really helped me understand what social work is all about and why it matters.

It's a pretty diverse area\u2014there are a lot of families, some older homes, and a few small businesses that have been around for years. The vibe is friendly and laid-back, but there's also a strong sense of community. People know each other, and there's always someone willing to lend a hand if you need it. I like that about it\u2014it feels like a place where everyone has a story, and you can always find something to learn from someone else.

There are some areas nearby where things can get rough, but I've never felt threatened in my own part of the city. The sense of community here helps a lot\u2014people look out for each other.

My mom always makes something simple but comforting\u2014like eggs and toast or maybe some arepas if she's feeling adventurous.

I remember one point where I was so overwhelmed with everything\u2014work, volunteering, school, and trying to figure out my future\u2014that I started skipping meals and not sleeping well. It wasn't anything serious, but it affected my focus and energy. I think what made it harder was that I didn't want to admit I was struggling. I felt like I should be able to handle it on my own, but in the end, it was my friends and family who helped me realize I didn't have to go through it alone. Now, I'm more aware of how important it is to take care of myself, both physically and mentally. I've learned that if I don't take care of my health, it's harder to do the things I want to do\u2014like helping others or working toward my goals. So I try to be more intentional about it now, even if it's just small steps like eating better, getting enough rest, or taking a few minutes to breathe when I feel overwhelmed.\n\n",

My parents made sure that faith was a part of our daily lives\u2014attending Mass every Sunday, celebrating holidays with family, and even saying prayers before meals. It wasn't just about following traditions; it was about feeling connected to something bigger than myself. I remember sitting in church as a kid, listening to the priest talk about kindness and forgiveness, and thinking how those values shaped the way my parents treated others. Even now, I find myself turning to faith when things feel uncertain. It's not about having all the answers, but about knowing that there's a sense of purpose and community in what I believe. I don't go to church as often as I used to, but I still find solace in the rituals and the lessons I learned growing up.

I think it's more of a passive thing for me\u2014checking in every now and then to see what's going on with my sister, my cousins, or even some of the teachers from high school.

We live in a modest two-bedroom apartment on Elm Street, and the rent is about $800 a month. My parents split the costs, so I only pay around $300, which is manageable. Groceries are another big one\u2014my mom does most of the cooking, and we stick to basics like rice, beans, vegetables, and some meat. We try to be careful with our spending, but sometimes we have to buy things on sale or from the local market to save money. Transportation is also a factor since I work at the grocery store and volunteer at the community center. I have an old car that I inherited from my uncle, and I pay for gas and maintenance out of my part-time earnings. I also set aside a little each month for savings, even if it's just $50 or so. It's not much, but it helps me feel like I'm working toward something. I know it's not the most comfortable life, but it's stable, and I'm grateful for that.

The breakdown is pretty consistent\u2014rent takes up the biggest chunk, as I mentioned, and then groceries, utilities, and transportation follow. We also have some smaller expenses like phone bills, internet, and occasional things like a movie night or a special meal when we feel like treating ourselves.

In the summer, for example, we use a lot more electricity for air conditioning, and that bumps up our utility bill. We also tend to spend a bit more on groceries during the holidays, especially around Christmas and Easter, when we like to have bigger meals and maybe even treat ourselves to something special. On the other hand, during the winter, we don't use as much electricity, so our utility costs go down a bit.

At the grocery store, my main duties are restocking shelves, helping customers find what they need, and keeping the aisles tidy. It's not glamorous work, but I take pride in making sure the store runs smoothly and that people can find what they're looking for. The most important part of my job, I think, is the interaction with the customers. Many of them are regulars, and I've come to know their names, their preferences, and even some of their stories. It's interesting how a simple conversation over a bag of chips or a loaf of bread can turn into a moment of connection. At the community center, my role has evolved a bit over the past year. I started as a volunteer, helping out with events and organizing supplies, but now I'm more involved in outreach programs and helping to coordinate activities for the kids and families in the neighborhood.

For example, I help out with local delivery services on weekends, especially during the busy season when people are ordering more online. I also do some handyman work for neighbors\u2014fixing things around their houses, painting, or even helping with small repairs. It's not a lot, but it gives me a little extra income and keeps me busy. I think it's important to have a few different ways to earn money, especially when you're still figuring out your path. Plus, it gives me a sense of independence and helps me feel like I'm contributing in more ways than just my part-time job or volunteering. I know it's not the most stable income, but it works for me right now.\n\n",

That includes my part-time income from the grocery store, my parents' earnings from their jobs, and the small amount I make from my side gigs like deliveries and handyman work. It's not a lot, but it's enough to cover our basic needs and a little extra for things like groceries, utilities, and even some savings. My parents have always been careful with money, and I've been learning from them how to budget and prioritize what's important. I know we're not wealthy, but I feel lucky to have a stable income and the support of my family. It's not about having everything, but about making sure we can cover the essentials and still have a little something left over for the things that make life worth it\u2014like family dinners, helping others, or even just taking a weekend trip to the beach.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nAngel Gonzalez: I've been working at the grocery store for about two years now, ever since I finished high school. It's been a steady job, and while it doesn't come with the typical benefits like health insurance or paid vacation time, it does offer some flexibility. I get to set my own schedule to a degree, which is important because I also volunteer at the community center and take online courses. The store does offer sick time, but it's not formalized like it is in some other jobs\u2014I just let my manager know when I'm not feeling well, and she's usually understanding. I know it's not the most glamorous job, but I appreciate the stability it gives me. It also gives me a chance to interact with people from all walks of life, which I find really rewarding. I've learned a lot from the regulars, and sometimes they share stories or advice that stick with me. It's not much, but I feel like I'm doing something meaningful, even if it's just restocking shelves or helping someone find the right product.\n\n",

She's been with the store for years and knows how things run. She's fair, and even though she's strict about keeping the store organized, she's also understanding when things get busy or when I need to adjust my schedule for volunteering or school. I think she sees me as someone who's trying to do more than just show up, and that means a lot. As for my coworkers, we get along well. Some of them have been there for a long time, and they've been really helpful in teaching me the ropes. We don't talk about much more than work, but there's a sense of camaraderie\u2014like when we're all working late or helping each other out during a rush. I don't have any close friends at work, but I feel like I'm part of a team, and that makes the job more bearable. I think the relationships are simple, but they're enough to make the work feel like something I can handle, even if it's not the most exciting place to be.\n\n",

I usually work the same hours every week\u20149 to 12 on Monday through Friday\u2014and my manager is pretty consistent about that. But if something comes up, like a family event or a volunteer commitment, she's usually willing to adjust my shifts if possible. That flexibility is important to me because it helps me balance everything else I'm trying to juggle. I also like that I can choose to work extra hours on weekends if I need to, especially during busy seasons. It's not the most flexible job in the world, but it's enough to give me a sense of control over my time, which I think is one of the reasons I've been able to keep going with my volunteering and online courses. I know some people have more unpredictable schedules, but for me, this predictability helps me feel more grounded and in charge of my own path.\n\n",

My parents have always been careful with what we have, and I've been learning from them how to budget, save, and prioritize what's important.

My dad worked in construction, and he was always out on job sites, sometimes working long hours, especially during the summer months when there was more demand. He always said that hard work was the key to getting ahead, and I think that's why he never complained, even when the work was tough. My mom, on the other hand, was a stay-at-home mom for most of my childhood, but she did work part-time at a local daycare for a few years when I was younger. She told me that she wanted to be there for me and my sister, but she also wanted to contribute to the family in her own way. I remember her talking about how she missed her own friends and the freedom of working outside the home, but she always put our needs first. It wasn't easy for them, especially when money was tight, but they always made sure we had what we needed. I think that's why I value education and hard work so much\u2014it's something they instilled in me from a young age, and I carry it with me even now as I try to figure out my own path.\n\n",

He was the kind of person who didn't just show up for the job\u2014he showed up with a plan, a toolbelt, and a willingness to work through anything that came his way. I remember watching him fix things around the house, whether it was repairing a roof or reinforcing a wall, and it always amazed me how he could take something broken and make it whole again. My mom, when she did work at the daycare, her most important duties were caring for the children, making sure they were safe, and helping them learn basic skills like counting, sharing, and following routines. She had a way of making every child feel seen and valued, even if they were just sitting quietly in a corner. I think that's why she was so good at it\u2014she treated every child like they were her own, and that made a difference. Looking back, I realize now that their work wasn't just about earning money\u2014it was about responsibility, care, and doing the right thing, even when it wasn't easy.

He was responsible for making sure that every job site ran smoothly, from laying the foundation to finishing the last nail. He always said that construction was like building a puzzle\u2014you had to know where each piece went and how it fit with the others. My mom worked at a small daycare center owned by a friend of the family. It wasn't a big business, just a few rooms in a converted house, but it was a place where kids could learn and grow in a safe, loving environment. She made sure that every child felt seen and heard, and she had a way of turning even the most difficult days into something positive.
