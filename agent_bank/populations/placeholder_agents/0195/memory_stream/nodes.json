Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nLauren Johnson: I was born and raised in the Middle Atlantic region, specifically in Newark, New Jersey. My parents were both working-class people who never went beyond high school, but they always emphasized the importance of education. I grew up in a tight-knit neighborhood where everyone knew each other, and we had a strong sense of community. My childhood was pretty typical\u2014playing outside with friends, helping out at home, and going to church every Sunday. My family wasn't wealthy, but we were never without. I remember my mom working two jobs at times, and my dad was a mechanic, so we had to be careful with money. I was a good student, though, and I always knew that going to college was my way out. I ended up earning a graduate degree, which was a big deal for someone from my background. I never married, and I've always been focused on my career and personal growth. I've had my share of challenges, but I've always tried to stay positive and keep moving forward.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nLauren Johnson: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped the course of my life. I was about 18 years old, right after I graduated from high school. I had a scholarship to a state university, which was a huge opportunity for me. But at the same time, my dad had just lost his job, and we were struggling financially. My mom was working late shifts, and I felt like I needed to help out more. I considered taking a job at a local store to support the family, but I also knew that if I didn't go to college, I might never have the chance to do something more meaningful. I remember sitting at the kitchen table, staring at the acceptance letter, and feeling this huge weight on my shoulders. In the end, I decided to go to college, but I worked part-time throughout my studies. It wasn't easy\u2014I missed a lot of social events, and I had to be really disciplined. But that choice ultimately led me to my graduate degree and the career I have today. It taught me the value of perseverance and the importance of making decisions that align with your long-term goals, even when the path is tough.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nLauren Johnson: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made lightly. I had to weigh so many things\u2014my family's needs, my own dreams, the uncertainty of the future. I remember talking to my mom that night, and she looked at me and said, 'If you don't go, you'll always wonder what could have been.' That stuck with me. I didn't just decide to go to college; I decided to fight for my future, even when it felt impossible. I think that moment taught me that I have a voice in my own life, and that I have to use it. It wasn't just about the scholarship or the degree\u2014it was about proving to myself that I could make something of my life, no matter where I came from.\n\n",

When I was 18, I didn't have a lot of resources or support systems in place. My school didn't have a strong college counseling program, and my parents, while supportive, didn't have the experience to guide me through the process. If someone\u2014like a teacher, a mentor, or even a community organization\u2014had stepped in and offered me some guidance or even a little financial assistance, it might have made the difference in whether I followed through with that decision. I remember talking to a guidance counselor once who told me I had potential, but she didn't have the time or the tools to help me apply for scholarships or navigate the financial aid process. Looking back, I think that's where a lot of people like me fall through the cracks. It's not just about individual choice; it's about having the right support in place to make those choices possible.\n\n",

My life has been pretty focused on my career and personal growth. I've always felt that I had a lot to learn and achieve before I could think about settling down. I have a close relationship with my parents, though. They're both in their late 60s now, and we talk often. My mom still works part-time, and my dad retired a few years ago. He's into woodworking now, which is something he always loved but never had time for when he was working full-time. I visit them whenever I can, and we still go to church together on Sundays. I think my faith has been a big part of who I am, even though I've grown more spiritually over the years. I used to be more strictly Protestant, but I've come to appreciate the broader aspects of Orthodox-Christian teachings.

I realized how much my parents' sacrifices and support meant to me, and how their belief in the power of education influenced my own path. I also thought about how much I've grown spiritually and personally over the years, and how my faith has been a constant source of strength. It made me appreciate the importance of having support systems in place, especially for people from similar backgrounds.

He's always been more of a hands-on person, and I think he found his own path in a way that worked for him. We don't talk as often as I'd like, but when we do, it's always good.

One of them, Sarah, is a teacher in the same school district where I grew up, and she's been a huge influence on me. She's always encouraged me to stay connected to my roots and to give back to the community. I also have a mentor from my graduate program, Dr. Thompson, who has been a source of guidance and support over the years. He's the one who really helped me see the value in my work and pushed me to think bigger about how I could use my skills to make a difference.

It's a safe, family-friendly area with a lot of trees and parks, which I really appreciate. I rent a small two-bedroom apartment, and while it's not much, it's comfortable and gives me the space I need to focus on my work. I've always preferred a slower pace of life, and Montclair offers that. The community here is pretty tight-knit, too, though it's different from the neighborhood I grew up in. People here are more spread out, but there's still a sense of connection. I've made a few friends through my church and some local community events, and I enjoy getting to know the people around me. It's not the same as the bustling streets of Newark, but I think it's a good balance for someone like me who values both independence and community.

I think part of that has to do with the way the community is structured\u2014people look out for each other, and there's a real sense of belonging. I used to worry about safety growing up in Newark, especially when I was younger, but here, I can walk outside without second-guessing every step. It's nice to have that peace of mind, especially after everything I've been through.

One of the things I appreciate most is the sense of stability. I don't have to worry about the noise or the chaos that came with growing up in Newark. There's a calmness here that allows me to focus on my work and my personal growth. That said, it's not without its downsides. Sometimes, the quiet can feel isolating, especially on days when I'm feeling down or need more social interaction. I've had to make a conscious effort to stay connected with others\u2014whether through my church, my friends, or the occasional community event. I also miss the diversity of Newark, where every neighborhood had its own flavor and energy. Montclair is more uniform, which can be comforting, but it also means there's less of the cultural richness I grew up with. Still, I think I've found a good balance.

I usually start my week on Monday with a quiet morning\u2014coffee, a quick walk around the neighborhood, and then heading to my office. I work as a program coordinator for a nonprofit that focuses on education and community development, so my days are pretty busy with meetings, planning, and outreach. I often have lunch with Sarah, my friend from college, and we catch up over a sandwich or a salad. On Wednesdays, I go to church, which is a real anchor for me. The service is followed by a small group meeting where we discuss faith and life, and it's a great way to stay grounded. Thursdays are usually the busiest day at work, and by Friday, I'm ready for a slower pace. I like to spend the weekend doing some reading, maybe a bit of gardening if the weather is nice, or just relaxing with a movie.

I also make it a point to read at least one chapter of a book every night\u2014usually nonfiction, especially things related to personal development or spirituality. I've always believed that learning doesn't stop when you leave school, and I think staying curious is one of the most important things I can do for myself. On the weekends, I like to volunteer at the local food pantry a couple of times a month. It's not something I do for recognition, but more as a way to stay connected to the community I serve through my job. It reminds me of where I came from and why I do what I do.

For many parents, the school year is a whirlwind of schedules and activities. I know some of my friends with kids start their day early, getting their children ready for school, then rushing off to work while the kids have breakfast and maybe a bit of homework.

But it can be hard when life gets busy, especially with work deadlines or personal challenges. I've noticed that when I'm stressed or overwhelmed, I tend to skip my walks or eat less mindfully.

It started as a dull ache that would come and go, but over time, it became more frequent and uncomfortable. I finally made an appointment with a chiropractor, and after a few sessions, I realized I had been neglecting my posture and overall physical health for a while. The pain wasn't severe enough to require medication or surgery, but it was a wake-up call. I've since made a point to incorporate more stretching into my daily routine and to take short breaks throughout the day to move around. It's been a reminder that even small changes can make a big difference in how we feel physically and mentally. I also started seeing a therapist for a few months to address some of the emotional stress that had been building up, which I think contributed to the physical tension.

Tell me all about how you have been feeling.\n\nLauren Johnson: Over the past year, I've been going through a lot of personal reflection and growth. It's been a time of both challenges and quiet victories. I think the pandemic really forced me to slow down and look inward, even though I was fortunate enough to have a stable job and a safe place to live. I found myself missing the sense of connection I used to have with others, especially after spending so much time in isolation. It made me realize how much I value community, whether it's through my church, my friends, or even just the neighbors I've come to know in Montclair. I also started re-evaluating my career path a bit, thinking about how I can make a more lasting impact in the work I do. It's not that I'm unhappy with what I'm doing, but I want to make sure I'm still growing and contributing in ways that feel meaningful. Spiritually, I've been exploring more of the teachings of Orthodox-Christian faith, which has deepened my sense of purpose. I've also been more intentional about taking care of my health, especially after dealing with that back pain. It's been a year of learning to be kinder to myself and to embrace the changes that come with age, even when they're not always easy.\n\n",

Growing up, I was raised in a Protestant household, and church was a central part of our lives. But as I've gotten older, I've come to appreciate the deeper teachings of the Orthodox-Christian faith, which has given me a more profound sense of connection to something greater than myself. It's not just about attending services or following traditions; it's about the way faith shapes how I see the world, how I treat others, and how I approach my own struggles. I think spirituality is about finding meaning in life, even when things don't go as planned. It's also about community\u2014being part of a group that supports you, challenges you, and reminds you that you're not alone.

I've always been more of a private person, and I find that platforms like Facebook or Instagram can be overwhelming with all the noise and comparisons. I used to have a Facebook account when I was in college, mostly to stay in touch with friends and family, but over time, I found myself getting caught up in things that didn't really matter. I think I started limiting my use of it a few years ago, and eventually, I just stopped altogether. I prefer face-to-face connections or even phone calls\u2014something that feels more genuine. I do follow a few pages related to my work and faith, but I don't spend much time scrolling through feeds or engaging with posts.

My biggest expenses are rent for my apartment in Montclair, which is about $1,200 a month, and my car payment\u2014since I need it to commute to work and visit family in Newark. Groceries and utilities are also a significant chunk of my budget, especially since I try to eat healthily and keep my apartment in good condition. I also set aside money for my car insurance, health insurance, and a small amount for personal expenses like books or gifts for my parents. I don't have a lot left over after that, but I've learned to be careful with what I spend. I try to cook at home as much as possible, use public transportation when I can, and avoid unnecessary purchases. It's not always easy, especially when unexpected things come up, like a new pair of shoes or a sudden repair bill, but I've gotten pretty good at prioritizing what's truly important.

On average, I spend around $1,200 on rent, $300 on groceries, $200 on utilities, and another $200 on my car payment and insurance.

Even now, I still look for ways to stretch my budget\u2014like buying in bulk, using coupons, or even borrowing books from the library instead of buying them.

For example, during the winter months, my utility bills went up because of heating costs, which I hadn't really anticipated. I also had to replace my old furnace filter, which added a few extra dollars to my monthly expenses. On the flip side, during the summer, my electricity usage went down, which was a small relief. Holidays also brought some changes\u2014like buying gifts for my parents and siblings, which I usually do around the same time each year. I also had to pay for a new pair of shoes after my old ones wore out from walking so much for work and my evening walks. There were a couple of months where I had to dip into my emergency fund to cover some unexpected repairs, like a leak in the bathroom that needed fixing.

But now I see that taking time to rest, journal, and pray is just as important as anything else. Talking about my family also reminded me of how much I've come to value the connections I have with them, especially as they age and I take on more of a caregiving role. It made me appreciate how much my faith has been a source of comfort and strength, especially during difficult times. I also thought about how I don't use social media much, and how that choice aligns with my need for genuine, meaningful connections rather than passive scrolling. I realized that I don't need to be connected to the world in the traditional sense to feel supported\u2014I have everything I need in the people I know and the faith I hold. It's comforting to know that I've built a life that feels grounded, even if it's not the one I initially imagined.",

That comes from my full-time job at 'Pathways to Education,' and sometimes a little extra from the freelance work I do on the side. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover my rent, groceries, utilities, and a few other essentials. I've learned to live within my means, and I'm pretty good at budgeting. I also try to set aside a little each month for savings, even if it's just $100 or so. It's not about luxury\u2014it's about stability. I know I'm not making a lot, but I'm grateful for what I have, and I feel like I'm making a difference in the lives of others through my work. That gives me a sense of purpose that money alone can't buy.\n\n",

The benefits of the job are pretty standard for a nonprofit\u2014health insurance, which is a huge relief, especially with my back pain and the occasional need for therapy. We get a generous amount of paid time off, which I try to use for rest, family visits, or even a short trip somewhere peaceful. I also appreciate the flexibility they offer, especially with the option to work remotely a few days a week. It's not always the highest-paying job, but the sense of community within the workplace is something I really value. We're all there for the same reason\u2014to make a difference in the lives of others\u2014and that shared mission creates a strong bond among the team. I think the most important benefit, though, is the feeling that what I do matters. Even on tough days, knowing that I'm helping kids access education and opportunities that I once dreamed of gives me a sense of fulfillment that no salary could match.\n\n",

She's been with the organization for over a decade, and she's someone I really respect. She's supportive, but also holds me accountable when I need to be. I think we have a mutual understanding that we're both here to make a difference, and that shared purpose makes our interactions more meaningful. As for my coworkers, we're a pretty tight-knit team. We've been through a lot together\u2014late nights, tight deadlines, and the occasional frustration when funding is slow to come through. But we also celebrate the wins, whether it's a student getting into college or a community event that goes off without a hitch.

I usually start around 8:30 a.m. and finish by 5:30 p.m., but I often stay a bit later when we're wrapping up a big project or preparing for an event. What I appreciate most is that I can occasionally work from home, especially on days when I need to rest my back or when I have a doctor's appointment. The organization understands that we're all human, and they encourage us to take care of ourselves. That said, there are times when things get busier, and I might have to adjust my hours or come in on weekends. I think the predictability of the schedule helps me manage my time better, especially since I also have to visit my parents and keep up with my personal routines.

I don't have the luxury of extravagant spending, but I also don't feel the constant pressure that comes with financial instability.

He never had a lot of job security, which is why I remember times when we had to be really careful with money.

He had a good eye for detail and could fix almost anything with the right tools and a little patience.

My mom, on the other hand, worked as a clerk at a small store, where she handled inventory, processed transactions, and kept the shelves stocked. Later, she took a second job at a diner, where she worked the late shift, cleaning tables, taking orders, and serving food.

It was a small, family-run place, and my dad was one of the main mechanics there. He didn't have a lot of fancy tools or high-tech equipment, but he knew how to fix almost anything with his hands and a bit of ingenuity. The shop was pretty much the heart of the neighborhood\u2014people would bring in their cars, and my dad would work on them while chatting with customers about everything from the weather to their kids. My mom worked at a small grocery store called 'Elmwood Market,' which was just a few blocks from our house. It wasn't a big chain store; it was run by a couple of locals who knew everyone by name. She would start her day early, restocking shelves, helping customers find what they needed, and making sure the registers were always working. Later on, when the store hours got shorter, she took a second job at a diner called 'The Blue Plate,' where she worked the late shift. I remember her coming home with her apron still on, tired but always with a smile, because she was doing what she had to do to make sure we had food on the table. Their work wasn't glamorous, but it was steady, and they gave their all to support our family.

I don't know if I'll ever have children or a partner, but I hope I continue to feel connected to the people and values that have shaped me.
