  "agent_profile_summary": "Claudia Schultz, a 43-year-old urban planning consultant living in Evanston, Illinois, grew up in a family that valued education and community service, influences that shaped her decision to pivot from a legal career to public policy after a transformative internship in urban development. Married with a five-year-old daughter, she balances part-time work with family life, often drawing on her parents’ example of dedication to education and service. A committed advocate for inclusive urban spaces, she volunteers at a community garden and collaborates with local governments to create equitable policies. Her life reflects a tension between professional ambition and the need to be present for her family, a balance she navigates through intentional routines, mindfulness, and a deep commitment to values like equity and connection, which guide both her work and her relationships."
