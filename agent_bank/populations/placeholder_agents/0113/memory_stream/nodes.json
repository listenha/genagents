Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nClaudia Schultz: I was born in Chicago, but I grew up in Evanston, which is just a few miles away. My parents were both highly educated\u2014my father had a graduate degree in engineering, and my mother earned a bachelor's in education. We lived in a comfortable home, and while my mother didn't work outside the home during my childhood, she was always involved in community activities and volunteering. I was raised Catholic, but as I got older, I became more secular in my views. I went to a good public school system, which gave me a strong academic foundation. I was always interested in learning, and I ended up pursuing a graduate degree in public policy, which I completed a few years ago. After that, I took a break from full-time work to focus on family, but I've been working part-time as a consultant in urban planning ever since. Life has had its ups and downs, but I've always tried to stay grounded and focused on what matters most.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nClaudia Schultz: Yes, there was a defining moment that shaped the course of my life. I was in my second year of college, studying political science, when I had the opportunity to intern with a local nonprofit focused on urban development. At the time, I was on a path to become a lawyer, but this experience opened my eyes to the power of policy in creating real change in people's lives. I remember one particular project where we worked to revitalize a neighborhood that had been neglected for years. I saw how policy decisions could either uplift or abandon communities, and it made me realize that I wanted to be part of the solution, not just the system. That internship was the crossroads\u2014after that, I switched my focus to public policy, earned my graduate degree, and eventually found my way into urban planning. It was a difficult decision at the time, because I had invested so much in the legal field, but looking back, it was the right choice for who I wanted to be.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nClaudia Schultz: I think it was a conscious choice, but one that felt inevitable after that internship. I had been questioning whether law was the right path for me, but I didn't fully realize it until I saw the impact of policy work firsthand. It wasn't just about changing my major\u2014it was about redefining my purpose. I remember sitting in my dorm room that night, staring at my law textbooks, and thinking, 'This isn't where I'm meant to be.' I made a list of all the things that mattered to me: community, equity, and the ability to create tangible change. Public policy checked all those boxes. So, I made the decision to pivot, even though it felt risky. I had to take out loans for my graduate degree, and there were moments of doubt, but I believed in the path I chose. Looking back, I don't think I could have made a different decision and still been true to myself.\n\n",

My mother, for instance, was always supportive, but she never had the same kind of career path I was considering. However, I was lucky to have a professor in my political science department who had worked in urban planning. She took me under her wing after that internship and encouraged me to explore that field more deeply. She even helped me connect with people in the industry and gave me the confidence to make the switch. I also remember talking to a few friends who were in similar situations, and hearing their stories helped me realize I wasn't alone in feeling uncertain. So, while the decision was ultimately mine, I don't think I would have made it as smoothly without the support and encouragement of those around me.\n\n",

We met in graduate school, actually\u2014though he was studying computer science and I was in public policy, we had a few classes together and bonded over our shared interest in how technology can shape communities. We've been married for about seven years now, and we have a five-year-old daughter named Lily. She's a curious and energetic child, and I love seeing the world through her eyes. Daniel and I have a good balance in our lives\u2014he handles the more technical aspects of our household, while I focus on our daughter's education and our community involvement. We both work part-time, which allows us to be more present for Lily, though it's not always easy.

My father, Thomas, is retired now but was a professor of engineering at a local university before he retired. He's always been a big supporter of my career choices, even when I took the less traditional path of switching from law to public policy. My mother, Margaret, is still very active in the community\u2014she volunteers at a local food bank and is on the board of a nonprofit that supports education for underprivileged children. Our relationship is close, though we don't see each other as often as I'd like. I still visit them regularly, and they always have open arms and a warm meal waiting for me. I also have an older brother, Michael, who lives in San Francisco and works in finance. We don't talk as much as I'd like, but when we do, it's always a reminder of how different our paths have been. He's always been more of a traditionalist, and while I respect his choices, I think our conversations often highlight how much my values have shaped my life in ways that differ from his.

One of them is Sarah, a fellow urban planner who I met during my graduate studies. We've been close ever since, and she's been a great mentor and sounding board for me throughout my career. We often collaborate on community projects, and I value her perspective because she's always pushing me to think more creatively about how we can make cities more inclusive and sustainable. Then there's my friend James, who works in social work. He's been a constant presence in my life, and our conversations often circle back to the intersection of policy and social justice. He's helped me stay grounded in the real-world impact of my work, which is something I really appreciate. I also have a small group of friends from college who I keep in touch with, even if we don't see each other as often as we'd like.

My street, Lakeview Drive, is quiet in the mornings, with the sound of birds and the occasional jogger passing by. There's a community garden just a few blocks away that I like to visit on weekends, and it's become a gathering spot for neighbors to share ideas and grow food together. The area is walkable, which is something I really appreciate, especially with Lily around. We're close to parks, libraries, and a few local businesses that support independent artisans.

The local police department has a good relationship with the community, and there are neighborhood watch programs that keep things peaceful.

One of the things I appreciate most is the walkability and the sense of community I mentioned earlier. However, there are also moments when I feel the weight of the city's ongoing issues\u2014like housing affordability and the pressure of development that sometimes prioritizes profit over people. I've seen some of the neighborhoods I work with struggle with displacement, and it's heartbreaking to see long-time residents forced out. That's why my work as an urban planner is so important to me\u2014it's not just about designing spaces, but about ensuring that everyone has a place to belong. At the same time, living in Evanston has given me a deep appreciation for the small things: the local bookstores, the farmers' markets, the way the seasons change here. It's a place that feels like home, even with its imperfections, and I'm grateful for that.\n\n",

On weekdays, I usually start my day around 7:30 a.m., after getting Lily up and getting her ready for school. I work part-time as a consultant in urban planning, so my days are often spent in meetings, reviewing proposals, or collaborating with local governments and community groups.

She attends a public elementary school in Evanston, which has a strong focus on arts and environmental education. Her school day runs from 8:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., and she usually has a snack and recess in between. After school, she comes home and has some time to relax before we have dinner.

I love taking Lily to the park in the afternoons, and those walks often turn into impromptu exercise sessions for me as well.

At first, I thought it was just a minor strain, but it gradually became more persistent, especially after long days of work or helping with household chores. I finally saw a physical therapist a few months ago, and it turned out to be related to poor posture from sitting at my desk for long periods while working from home.

But there have also been times when I've felt overwhelmed, especially when balancing work deadlines with Lily's needs or when I'm trying to stay on top of my health while managing everything else. I've learned to be more compassionate with myself, though, and to recognize that it's okay to have off days. I've also found comfort in the small, everyday moments\u2014like watching Lily laugh while we're in the park, or sharing a quiet evening with Daniel. Those are the things that remind me why I do what I do, and they help me keep going even when things feel heavy.\n\n",

It also made me realize how small changes, like incorporating meditation or using a standing desk, can have a big impact on my overall balance and ability to show up for my family and work.

How about for you?\n\nClaudia Schultz: I think I've experienced moments of anxiety, especially during the busier times when work and family responsibilities felt overwhelming. There were days when I worried I wasn't doing enough for Lily or that I wasn't making a meaningful impact in my work. I remember one particularly stressful period when I was juggling a major project at work, helping Lily with a school presentation, and also dealing with the ongoing back pain. It felt like everything was pulling me in different directions, and I wasn't sure how to keep up. I started seeing a therapist a few months ago, and that's been really helpful. Talking through those feelings has allowed me to process them in a healthier way, and I've learned to recognize when I need to slow down or ask for help. I don't think I'd label it as clinical anxiety, but I do believe that everyone has moments of stress and self-doubt, and it's important to address them before they become heavier to carry. I've come to see those feelings not as failures, but as signals that I need to take a step back and realign with what truly matters to me.\n\n",

He's taken on more of the household responsibilities, especially when I've been dealing with the back pain, and I'm so grateful for his patience and understanding. Lily, on the other hand, has been a constant source of joy and resilience. She's growing up in a world that feels both exciting and uncertain, and I see her starting to understand the complexities of the world around her. She asks questions about fairness, about why some people have more than others, and it reminds me of why my work matters.

But as I grew older and started questioning more about the world, I found that my faith didn't quite align with the way I saw things. I began to see religion more as a personal journey rather than something I needed to follow strictly. Now, I would say I'm more spiritual than religious\u2014I believe in the importance of community, connection, and living with intention, but I don't tie those values to a specific faith. I still respect the role religion plays in people's lives, and I think it can be a source of comfort and meaning for many.

I also follow a few urban planning and social justice pages that share interesting research or community stories\u2014I find it helpful to stay informed about the issues that matter to me.

I think I've always leaned more on my immediate circle\u2014my family, my close friends, and my colleagues in the urban planning field. When I've been struggling, whether it was with work, health, or just the general chaos of life, it's been the people I know in person who have offered the most meaningful support. That said, I do think social media can be a double-edged sword. I've seen friends find community and encouragement online, especially around issues like mental health or parenting, and I respect that.

We live in a modest home in Evanston, and while the mortgage is manageable, it's still a significant portion of our budget. Lily's childcare costs are another major expense\u2014since we both work part-time, we use a combination of a local daycare and after-school programs, which adds up. Groceries are also a regular expense, especially since I try to prioritize healthy, organic foods whenever possible. We also have some recurring bills like internet, utilities, and car insurance. To make ends meet, I've been careful with our spending, and we've made a conscious effort to limit unnecessary purchases. Daniel and I also both have part-time jobs, which helps, but it's not always easy to balance work and family without feeling stretched thin.

The breakdown is pretty consistent\u2014housing is the largest chunk, around $2,200 for the mortgage, and then about $1,200 on childcare, which includes both the daycare and the after-school programs Lily attends.

We try to be mindful of our spending, so we don't go overboard on entertainment or dining out, though we do treat ourselves to a family meal out once in a while.

It's a three-bedroom house on Lakeview Drive, which is exactly where I grew up, and that connection to my roots has been meaningful for me.

In the winter months, our heating bill tends to spike, and we also spend a bit more on groceries because we're cooking more at home and trying to keep the kids warm. During the summer, we use less electricity for heating, but we do spend more on outdoor activities, like buying sunscreen, swim gear, and sometimes even a family trip to a nearby lake or park.

It was a way to stay connected to the issues I cared about while also earning some extra income.

That includes my part-time consulting work, Daniel's income from his software development job, and some freelance writing I did on the side. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our basic needs and give us some flexibility. I think what's most important to me is that we're not just surviving\u2014we're thriving in the way that matters to us. We're able to provide for Lily, support our community, and still have time for the things that bring us joy, like weekend walks in the park or quiet evenings at home. It's not always easy, but I feel lucky that we've found a balance that works for our family.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nClaudia Schultz: I've been working as a part-time urban planning consultant for about four years now, though my journey in this field has been longer than that. I started out as a full-time employee with a local municipality, but after having Lily, I transitioned to part-time work to be more present for her. The benefits of my current job are pretty standard for part-time roles\u2014health insurance is the most important one, as it covers both Daniel and me, and it includes some mental health services, which I've found really helpful. We also get a few weeks of paid time off each year, which is something I try to use for family vacations or to recharge. Sick time is more limited, but I've learned to be proactive about taking care of myself so I don't burn out. One of the things I appreciate most about my job is the flexibility\u2014it allows me to work from home most of the time, which is a huge help with balancing work and family. I also get to collaborate with people who are passionate about creating better communities, which makes the work feel meaningful even on the days when it's challenging.\n\n",

I work with a variety of people\u2014local government officials, community organizers, and sometimes even residents who are directly impacted by the projects we're working on. My manager, who I'll call Rachel, is someone I really respect. She's been in the field for over a decade and has a deep understanding of both the technical and human sides of urban planning. She's supportive of my work-life balance, which is something I really appreciate, especially as a mother. We have a good rapport, and she's always willing to listen and offer guidance when I need it. As for my coworkers, I work with a small team of consultants, and we have a strong sense of camaraderie. We often collaborate on projects, and I value the way we challenge each other's ideas while also supporting one another's growth. I think the key to our good relationships is that we all share a common goal\u2014making sure that the communities we work with are not just developed, but truly inclusive and sustainable. It's not always easy, and there are moments when we disagree or face difficult challenges, but I feel like I'm part of a team that cares about the work we do and the people we serve.\n\n",

Since I work as a consultant, I don't have a set 9-to-5 routine like I did when I was full-time. Most of my projects are structured around deadlines or community meetings, so I can often plan my days around Lily's school schedule or personal commitments. That said, there are times when I have to be more rigid, especially when I'm in the middle of a major project or preparing for a public hearing. I try to communicate clearly with my clients and colleagues so they know when I'm available and when I might need to adjust my hours. Flexibility is a double-edged sword\u2014it gives me the freedom to be present for my family, but it also requires me to be disciplined in managing my time. I've learned to set boundaries, like designating specific hours for work and making sure I take breaks to recharge. It's not perfect, but it's a balance that works for me and allows me to stay engaged in the work I love without sacrificing the things that matter most.\n\n",

We're not wealthy by any means, but we're stable enough to cover our needs and even have some room for small indulgences or savings. I think what matters most to me is that we're not living paycheck to paycheck, and that we're able to provide Lily with the opportunities and experiences that will help her grow into a thoughtful, compassionate person. There are days when I worry about the future\u2014about whether we'll be able to afford college for her, or if we'll have to make difficult choices if something unexpected comes up. But I also know that we've built a life that's rooted in values, and that gives me a sense of security I can't put a price on.

It also made me think about how my part-time work and savings habits contribute to a sense of security, even if we're not living in luxury. Talking about my emotional coping strategies and how I manage stress highlighted the need to be intentional with both my time and resources, especially when raising a child and working in a field that values equity and inclusion. I've come to realize that financial stability isn't just about numbers\u2014it's about creating a life that supports both my well-being and the well-being of those I love.",

She worked as a teacher in the Evanston public school system for several years before I was born, and even after I was born, she continued teaching part-time for a while. I remember her being very dedicated to her students and to the community, and I think that's where I got my own passion for education and public service. However, as I grew older, she decided to take a break from teaching to be more present for our family and to volunteer in other ways, like with the food bank and the nonprofit that supports education for underprivileged children. I always admired her for making that choice, and it showed me that there are many ways to contribute to society\u2014whether through paid work, volunteering, or raising children with values that matter. It's something I think about often, especially as I balance my own career and family life.\n\n",

She was known for her patience, creativity, and deep commitment to education. I remember her spending long hours grading papers, planning lessons, and staying after school to help students who were struggling. What stood out to me most was how she treated every child with respect and believed in their potential, even when others didn't. She also made it a point to stay involved in the community\u2014whether it was organizing parent-teacher meetings, volunteering at school events, or mentoring new teachers. Her work wasn't just about academics; it was about shaping young minds and instilling values like empathy and curiosity. Even after she stepped back from full-time teaching, she continued to support education through her volunteer work, which is something I deeply admire. I think her example is what inspired me to pursue a career in public service, where I can make a difference in people's lives in a similar way, even if the setting is different.\n\n",

It's not a for-profit business, but rather a public institution that serves the community by providing education to children from diverse backgrounds. Her role as a teacher involved not only teaching subjects like math and literature, but also fostering a sense of belonging and curiosity in her students. She made sure that every child felt seen and heard, and she often stayed late to help those who needed extra support. She didn't make a lot of money compared to other professions, but she always said that the rewards of seeing her students grow and succeed were more valuable than any salary. I remember her talking about the challenges of working in a public school\u2014like limited resources and large class sizes\u2014but she never lost her passion for teaching. She believed that education was the foundation of a just society, and that belief shaped the way she approached her work every day. I think that's why I was drawn to public policy and urban planning\u2014because I wanted to be part of something that had a similar impact, even if the setting was different.\n\n",
