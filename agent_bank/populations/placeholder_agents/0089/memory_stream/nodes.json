Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAmiyah Nair: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Mumbai, India, but my family moved to San Francisco when I was just six years old. Growing up, we lived in Pacific Heights, which was quite different from the bustling city life in Mumbai. My parents were both highly educated\u2014my father had a graduate degree and worked in technology, while my mother had a bachelor's degree and was always working either at home or in a professional setting. They instilled in me a strong sense of values and a desire to succeed academically and personally. My family structure remained intact until I graduated high school, after which we moved to a different state for my father's job. It was a significant change, but it allowed me to experience a broader range of cultures and perspectives.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAmiyah Nair: One such moment came when I was deciding whether to pursue a graduate degree or take a job right out of college. My parents encouraged me to follow my passion, but I also felt the pressure to start earning and contribute to our household. After much contemplation, I chose to go back to school, which turned out to be one of the best decisions of my life. It opened doors to new opportunities and deepened my knowledge in my field. I'm now glad I took that path, even though it meant delaying starting my career.\n\n",

It was a mix of both conscious choices and moments where things aligned in a way that felt right. The support from my parents, combined with the encouragement from my professors, helped me see the potential benefits of further education. So while there was a lot of thought involved, the final decision didn't feel like a forced choice\u2014it felt like something that was meant to happen.\n\n",

It's been a process, but I feel more resilient and better equipped to handle whatever comes my way.

My biggest expenses last month were rent and utilities, followed by groceries and transportation. John and I split those costs, which helps keep things manageable. We also set aside money for savings and occasional fun outings. It's a delicate balance, but we're committed to supporting each other through it.\n\n",

We also try to save money during the holiday season by sticking to a budget for gifts and parties.

The interview highlighted the significant role that support systems, both familial and professional, have played in my journey. From my parents' encouragement to my husband's understanding, the people around me have provided the necessary strength and guidance. The decision to return to school after graduation, although challenging, has proven to be transformative, opening doors to new opportunities and deepening my knowledge in my field. Reflecting on the past year, I realized the importance of recognizing and addressing mental health challenges proactively. Therapy, mindfulness practices, and a strong support network have been instrumental in helping me manage stress and maintain balance. As I look to the future, I am committed to continuing this practice of self-care and finding a sustainable balance between work and personal life. The interview underscored the value of relationships, whether they be with family, friends, or colleagues, in navigating life's challenges with resilience and grace.",
