  "agent_profile_summary": "Kelsey Marrero, 34, grew up in a close-knit family in Charleston, South Carolina, where her parents' steady work ethic and support for education shaped her early life. After attending Catholic school, she transitioned to public high school, where she developed a passion for debate and theater, skills that later influenced her career path. Choosing to attend community college before transferring to a university allowed her to balance financial responsibility with academic growth, a decision that now underpins her role as a marketing coordinator for a local firm. A committed volunteer with a non-profit focused on youth education, Kelsey balances her professional ambitions with a deep sense of community involvement. Her life reflects a steady push toward financial stability and personal fulfillment, guided by the values of hard work and connection she inherited from her family, while navigating the ongoing tension between career growth and the desire for a more settled, independent future."
