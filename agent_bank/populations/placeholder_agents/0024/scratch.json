  "agent_profile_summary": "Andrea Martinez, a 39-year-old software developer in Austin, Texas, grew up in a modest household where her parents instilled strong Catholic values and a work ethic that shaped her approach to life. After high school, she chose to take a year off to work at a local restaurant, saving for college—a deliberate step that gave her clarity about her academic and financial goals. Married to a fellow software engineer, she balances a demanding full-time job with community involvement, including a weekly commitment to a neighborhood garden project. As she and her husband navigate the challenges of planning for a family, Andrea reflects on the importance of stability, support systems, and informed choices. Her life is guided by a blend of faith, practicality, and a deep appreciation for family and community, which influence how she approaches both personal and professional challenges with a grounded, thoughtful perspective."
