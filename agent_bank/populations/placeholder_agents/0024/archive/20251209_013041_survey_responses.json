            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Andrea seems to be a balanced individual who values family and community but also appreciates moments of solitude and reflection. She mentions having a supportive network of family and friends, but she also emphasizes the importance of her personal routines and the support of her husband. This suggests she is neither overly reserved nor extremely outgoing. Therefore, a moderate score is more fitting.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview transcript, Andrea seems to be a warm and supportive individual who values community and faith. She describes her parents and community as supportive and she finds comfort in her faith. These traits suggest she is likely to be trusting of others, which aligns more with a higher score on the trust scale.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Andrea's responses, she seems to be someone who values hard work and takes pride in her contributions to her family and career. She mentions making conscious choices and practicing mindfulness to manage stress, which suggests she is not lazy. Additionally, she works full-time and is actively trying to start a family, indicating a strong work ethic and dedication to her responsibilities.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview transcript, Andrea appears to be someone who values stability and support in her life. She mentions experiencing stress, particularly around the process of trying to start a family, but she also describes using coping mechanisms like mindfulness and support from her community to manage these feelings. Given her efforts to maintain a balanced life and her positive outlook, it seems she would likely rate herself as someone who handles stress well rather than being highly stressed. However, the stress of starting a family is still present, so it's not a perfect 5. A middle ground of 3 seems most appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Andrea Martinez describes herself as a software engineer and mentions her focus on work and family life, without highlighting any specific artistic interests. While she values her faith and community involvement, there is no indication of a strong artistic bent. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that she sees herself as someone with few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Andrea Martinez seems to have a strong network of friends and family, participates in community activities, and enjoys outdoor activities with others. These details suggest that she is sociable and enjoys being around people, which aligns more with a higher score on the sociability scale.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Andrea appears to be a warm and supportive person. She emphasizes the importance of hard work, community involvement, and the value of others in her life. She has described herself and her husband as supportive partners, and she appreciates the strengths of her family and friends. This suggests that she is more likely to see herself as someone who doesn't often find fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on the interview, Andrea describes herself as someone who values hard work and quality. She mentions that she spends a lot of time coding and reviewing code from other developers, indicating a commitment to doing thorough work. Additionally, her focus on building an emergency fund and saving for a down payment shows a detailed and careful approach to managing finances. These traits suggest that she would likely rate herself as someone who does a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Andrea describes herself as dealing with some anxiety over the past year, especially regarding the possibility of starting a family. While she finds comfort and support from her faith and community, she acknowledges that anxiety is a part of her life. Given this, it seems more aligned with a middle ground rather than consistently feeling extremely nervous (5) or never feeling nervous (1).",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on Andrea's background, she seems to be a practical and down-to-earth person. While she appreciates the value of creativity and innovation in her work as a software developer, the interview does not suggest a strong inclination towards purely imaginative or artistic pursuits. She is more focused on stability, community, and tangible outcomes, which aligns more with a lower score on the imagination scale."

            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Andrea describes herself as someone who has faced various challenges and has leaned on her support system to navigate them. While she has experienced some stress, such as trying to start a family and balancing work, she doesn't seem to portray herself as someone who gets easily overwhelmed or struggles to reason under pressure.
