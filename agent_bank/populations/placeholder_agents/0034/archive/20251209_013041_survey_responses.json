She mentions having a close group of friends and participating in activities like a book club. This suggests she is not extremely reserved. However, she also talks about the importance of having quiet time and a supportive environment, indicating she does value some alone time and isn't overly outgoing all the time. Given this balance, a middle-ground choice seems fitting.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Given the participant's description of herself as someone who values a strong support network and cherishes the relationships she has with friends, family, and mentors, it is reasonable to assume that she is generally trusting of others. Her emphasis on the importance of these relationships suggests that she is open and willing to trust others, especially those close to her.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on the interview, Isabella describes herself as someone who values discipline and productivity. She talks about her routine of exercising, studying, and volunteering, which suggests she is not someone who tends to avoid effort or procrastinate. Additionally, she mentions implementing new strategies to cope with stress and manage her time effectively, indicating a proactive approach to her life. Therefore, it's unlikely that she would see herself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Isabella has expressed some anxiety and stress, particularly regarding college applications and financial uncertainties. However, she has also mentioned implementing coping strategies like journaling and meditation, and has a support network to rely on. While she does experience stress, she seems to have developed some methods to manage it, suggesting she is more aligned with option 4 or 5. Given her awareness of her stress and efforts to mitigate it, a 4 seems most fitting, but considering her efforts, a 5 is a better prediction.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Given Isabella's background and current situation, it seems unlikely that she would strongly identify as someone with few artistic interests. Throughout the interview, she mentions celebrating cultural traditions from Puerto Rico and engaging in activities that involve creativity, such as reading books and potentially participating in volunteer work. Her openness to learning and experiencing different cultures also suggests an appreciation for arts and creativity.",

She emphasizes the importance of her support network and highlights how her friends and family enrich her life. There's no indication that she is overly critical of others.

            "BFI-10_8": "Based on the interview, Isabella Rodriguez seems to value thoroughness and detail. She mentions taking a gap year to travel and learn, which indicates a desire to do things carefully and thoughtfully.

            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Isabella has mentioned experiencing anxiety and feeling overwhelmed from time to time, especially when things get busy or when she faces academic pressures. However, she has also described implementing coping mechanisms like talking things out with friends and practicing mindfulness. This suggests that while she does experience nervousness, it is not an overwhelming or constant issue for her. Therefore, a score of 3 seems most appropriate, reflecting that she sometimes feels nervous but can manage these feelings effectively.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Isabella Rodriguez is someone who enjoys learning about different cultures and meeting new people, suggesting a curious and open-minded nature. She also mentions taking a gap year to explore the world, which indicates a willingness to engage with new experiences and ideas. These traits suggest she might consider herself imaginative, albeit in a practical rather than purely artistic sense. Given her open and adventurous spirit, it seems more likely that she would place herself closer to the higher end of the scale."

            "REI_4": "During the interview, Isabella described several impulsive and spontaneous actions, such as taking a gap year to travel and choosing to work part-time while saving for college.

However, she has also described implementing strategies like journaling and meditation to cope with these pressures. This suggests she can handle some level of stress and does not completely break down under pressure, but she also acknowledges that it is a challenge.
