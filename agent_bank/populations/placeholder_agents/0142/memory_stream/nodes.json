    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAdrian Santos: I was born in the Philippines, but I moved to the United States when I was five years old. My family settled in New England, specifically in Boston, where I've lived ever since. Growing up, I was raised by my parents in a tight-knit household. Both of my parents are highly educated\u2014my father earned a graduate degree in engineering, and my mother has a graduate degree in education. They always emphasized the importance of education and hard work, which shaped a lot of my values. I was a pretty quiet kid, always more interested in books and puzzles than in playing outside. I remember my mother reading to me every night, and my father would often sit with me after school to help with my homework. I didn't have a lot of money growing up, but we never lacked for love or support. I went to public school in Boston, and I was always a good student, though I wasn't the most outgoing. I think that's why I gravitated toward subjects like math and science\u2014they were predictable, and I could always count on them to make sense. I eventually earned a bachelor's degree in computer science from a local university, which led me to my current job as a software developer. I've never been married and don't have any children, but I've always been close with my parents and siblings. Life hasn't been without its challenges, but I've always tried to stay focused on what I can control\u2014like my work, my education, and my faith. I'm a Protestant, and I've been active in my church community since I was a teenager. It's been a big part of my life, giving me a sense of purpose and belonging.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAdrian Santos: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped my path. I was in my junior year of high school, and I had the opportunity to apply for a summer internship at a local tech company. At the time, I was still pretty unsure about what I wanted to do with my life. I had always been good at math and science, but I didn't see myself as someone who would end up in tech. My parents encouraged me to apply, and I did. The process was nerve-wracking\u2014I had to go through interviews and even a coding test. I was really nervous because I didn't have much experience, but I told myself that if I didn't try, I'd always wonder what could have been. I got the internship, and it was eye-opening. I saw how technology could solve real problems and make people's lives better. That experience solidified my interest in computer science, and I decided to major in it in college. It wasn't an easy road\u2014there were times when I felt overwhelmed, especially as one of the few students from a non-traditional background in my program. But I kept pushing forward, and I'm grateful for that moment because it led me to where I am today.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nAdrian Santos: I think it was a conscious choice, but not in the way you might expect. I wasn't one of those people who suddenly had a 'lightbulb moment' and knew exactly what they wanted to do. It was more of a gradual realization. I remember sitting in that internship, watching my coworkers solve complex problems and build something that had a real impact, and I thought, 'This is the kind of work I want to be doing.' I made a decision then to commit to it, even though I didn't know all the details of what that would look like. I had to actively choose to pursue computer science in college, to take on challenges that scared me, and to push past the doubts that came with being in a field where I was often the only one who looked like me. So, yes, it was a choice\u2014but it wasn't a single moment. It was a series of small, deliberate steps that added up over time.\n\n",

In fact, I think that support made all the difference. My high school had a mentorship program through a local nonprofit that connected students with professionals in various fields. I was paired with a software engineer who had immigrated from the Philippines, just like me. He didn't just talk about his career\u2014he shared his struggles, his doubts, and how he navigated a field that wasn't always welcoming to people like us. His guidance gave me the confidence to apply for that internship, and later, to stay committed to my studies. I also had professors in college who took the time to mentor me, even when I wasn't the most outspoken student. They saw potential in me and pushed me to step out of my comfort zone. So, while I made the choice to pursue this path, I wouldn't have had the courage or clarity to do it without the support of others who believed in me.\n\n",

My parents are still living in the same house we grew up in, and we're very close. My father is retired now, but he still keeps busy with community projects, especially ones that involve education and technology. My mother runs a small tutoring center for kids in our neighborhood, which is something she's always been passionate about. I visit them often, and we still have that routine of sitting down for dinner together, even if it's not every night. I also have two younger siblings\u2014one is a nurse in California, and the other is a teacher in New York. We keep in touch regularly, and I always make it a point to attend family gatherings whenever I can. While I've never been married, I've never felt like I was missing out on anything. My life has been full in other ways\u2014through my work, my faith, and the relationships I've built with my family and friends. I think the most important thing is that I've always known where I belong, and that's with the people who have supported me from the beginning.\n\n",

She's the one who taught me how to cook my favorite Filipino dishes, like adobo and sinigang, and she always reminds me of the importance of family traditions. Even though she doesn't speak English as fluently as my parents do, she's always been a big part of my life. I remember growing up, she would sit with me after school and help me with my math homework, even though she didn't understand the concepts herself. She would just encourage me, saying, 'You're smart, Adrian. You just have to keep trying.' That kind of support meant the world to me, and I still feel her presence in everything I do.

One of them is Maria, a fellow software developer I met in college. We bonded over our shared interest in coding and our backgrounds as first-generation immigrants. She's been a great friend and even helped me through some of the more challenging times in my career. Then there's my pastor, Father Thomas, who has been a spiritual guide and a mentor in my church community. He's always been there to offer advice, whether it's about work, life, or just having a good conversation over coffee. I also have a few close friends from my high school days who I still keep in touch with, even though we've all gone different paths. They remind me of who I was and how far I've come.

It's in the Beacon Hill area, which is known for its cobblestone streets and rich history. I've lived on Beacon Street for several years now, and I've come to love the quiet charm of the place. There are a lot of families here, and the community feels tight-knit, which is something I really appreciate. I often walk to work, and I enjoy the sense of history that surrounds me.

The streets are well-lit, and there's always someone around\u2014whether it's a neighbor walking their dog or a shopkeeper chatting with passersby. I think part of it is the sense of community that's still strong here. People know each other, and there's a kind of unspoken respect that comes with that. I've lived here for a while now, and I've never felt the need to worry about my safety the way I might in a more crowded or unfamiliar area.

On the positive side, I love the sense of history and the quiet pace of life. It's a neighborhood where you can walk outside without needing to rush, and there's always something interesting to see or learn. The local bookstores and cafes are like little sanctuaries where I can recharge, and I've made some good friends through community events and church activities. But it's not without its challenges.

I started going to the gym more regularly, and I've made an effort to eat healthier\u2014though I still have a sweet tooth for Filipino desserts like halo-halo, which I can't resist. I also try to get enough sleep, which is something I used to neglect when I was working long hours or dealing with deadlines.

What makes it easier is having small, consistent habits\u2014like waking up a little earlier to stretch, eating more whole foods, and making time for exercise even if it's just a short walk around the neighborhood. I also find that staying connected with my faith and taking time to reflect or pray in the morning helps me feel more centered, which in turn makes it easier to make healthier choices throughout the day. What makes it harder, though, is the occasional slip-up\u2014whether it's skipping a workout because I'm tired or giving in to that extra slice of cake at a family gathering. I've learned to be kind to myself when that happens, though. I think the key is balance, and I'm still learning what that looks like for me.

How about you?\n\nAdrian Santos: Honestly, my back pain hasn't really interfered with my work or my ability to care for my family, which I'm grateful for. I've had to make some adjustments, like taking more frequent breaks during the day or using ergonomic tools at my desk, but I've been able to manage it without major disruptions. I think the biggest challenge has been learning to listen to my body and not push through the pain when I need to rest. At first, I was worried that this kind of issue would hold me back, but instead, it's taught me the importance of self-care and balance. I've also become more mindful of how my work habits affect my health, which has led me to make some positive changes in how I structure my day. It's not always easy, but I've come to see it as part of the journey\u2014something that reminds me to slow down, take care of myself, and not take my health for granted.\n\n",

Professionally, I've taken on more responsibility at work, which has been both challenging and rewarding. I've been leading a small team on a new project, and while it's been stressful at times, it's also given me a sense of accomplishment that I didn't expect.

How about for you?\n\nAdrian Santos: I think I've been fortunate in that I haven't struggled with depression or anxiety in the way some people do, but I've had my moments of feeling overwhelmed or uncertain, especially during times of transition. There was a period a few years ago when I was juggling a demanding job, family responsibilities, and personal goals, and I felt like I wasn't doing enough in any of them. It wasn't clinical, but it was a feeling of being stretched thin, of not having enough time or energy to give everything the attention it deserved. I've learned to recognize those feelings for what they are\u2014not as signs of failure, but as signals that I need to slow down, take a step back, and prioritize what truly matters. I've also found that talking to friends, going to church, and even just taking a walk in the neighborhood have helped me reset and regain perspective.

She still finds joy in small things, like watching the seasons change or sharing stories from her youth. My siblings and I have stayed close, even with the distance between us.

It's not just about attending services or following rules\u2014it's about finding purpose, connection, and a sense of belonging. My faith has helped me through difficult times, whether it was navigating the challenges of being a first-generation immigrant, dealing with self-doubt in my career, or simply feeling overwhelmed by the pace of life.

I've always been more of a private person, and I find that platforms like Facebook or Instagram can be overwhelming with all the noise and comparison. I do keep in touch with family and a few close friends through messaging apps, but I don't spend a lot of time scrolling through feeds or engaging with content online.

But I've learned that it's okay to ask for help, whether it's from my parents, my friends, or even my pastor.

I also have regular expenses for utilities, internet, and transportation, which includes my car payment and gas.

The bulk of that goes to rent\u2014my apartment in Beacon Hill is comfortable but not cheap, and it's one of the few things I can't really negotiate.

The rent is definitely one of the biggest expenses, but I've come to appreciate the convenience of living in a safe, familiar neighborhood.

The most important activities in my job include writing clean, efficient code, collaborating with other developers and designers, and working closely with clients to understand their needs and ensure the software meets their expectations.

    "content": "Going through the recent interview topics from questions 31 to 35 made me reflect on how much my approach to stress, financial management, and emotional support has evolved over time. It's been a journey of learning to manage my stress more effectively, whether through journaling, taking short breaks, or reaching out to the people I trust. I've come to see stress not as something to fear, but as a part of life that can be managed with intention and support. Financially, I've learned to be more mindful of my budget, prioritizing what truly matters while still finding ways to save for the future. It's not always easy, but I've come to appreciate the small victories\u2014like setting aside a few hundred dollars each month or adjusting my spending to cover unexpected expenses. Most importantly, I've realized that I don't need to rely on social media or external validation for emotional support. My family, friends, and faith have always been there for me, and that gives me a deep sense of security and belonging. These reflections have helped me feel more grounded and in control of my life, even when things don't always go as planned.",

That includes my salary as a software developer, which is the main source of income, and a small part-time gig I've taken on with a local nonprofit where I help with some coding projects on weekends. While it's not a huge amount, it's enough to cover my rent, groceries, utilities, and a few other expenses. I also set aside a portion of that income for savings, which I've come to see as an essential part of my financial plan. I know it's not extravagant, but it's stable, and I'm grateful for the opportunities I have to provide for myself and contribute to my family when I can.\n\n",

The company offers a good set of benefits, including health insurance that covers me and my parents, which is something I really appreciate given our family situation. We also get paid time off, which includes vacation days, sick leave, and a few personal days. I've used those days to take short trips with my family or to recharge when I need to. One of the things I like most about the workplace is the culture\u2014it's collaborative, and there's a real emphasis on supporting each other, especially when we're working on complex projects. The company also offers some professional development opportunities, like attending conferences or taking online courses, which I've taken advantage of to keep my skills sharp. While the job can be demanding, the benefits and the sense of community here have made it a place where I feel valued and supported.\n\n",

I have a good rapport with my manager, who I've come to respect both professionally and personally. He's someone who leads by example and always encourages us to think creatively and take ownership of our projects. I appreciate that he's approachable and willing to listen, even when we're facing tight deadlines or tough technical challenges. As for my coworkers, I'd say we have a strong sense of camaraderie. We've been through a lot together\u2014late nights, last-minute fixes, and the occasional frustration\u2014but there's a real sense of mutual support. I've formed close friendships with a few of them, and we often grab lunch or coffee together. It's not just about working well together; it's about knowing that you can rely on each other when things get tough. I think that kind of environment makes a big difference, especially in a field like software development, where the work can be isolating if you're not careful.

The company encourages a healthy work-life balance, so I'm not expected to be in the office every single day. That said, there are times when we're working on tight deadlines or launching a new product, and those weeks can be a bit more unpredictable.

He was very detail-oriented and had a strong sense of responsibility, which I think came from growing up in a family that valued education and hard work.
