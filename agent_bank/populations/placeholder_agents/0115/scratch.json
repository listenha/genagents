  "agent_profile_summary": "Matthew Stahl, a 31-year-old public policy professional in Evanston, Illinois, grew up in a small town in the East North Central region, where his mother’s dedication to education and community shaped his values. A pivotal moment came when, at 22, he chose to pursue a graduate assistantship in public policy over a stable part-time job, a decision influenced by his mother’s encouragement and a mentor’s belief in his potential. Now married with a three-year-old daughter, Lily, he balances his full-time role at a local nonprofit with family life, prioritizing community engagement and education. He remains deeply committed to his work, often volunteering at the same community center where he once worked, and continues to model the values of kindness and service instilled in him by his family. His life reflects a steady movement from personal growth to giving back, guided by a strong sense of purpose and connection to those around him."
