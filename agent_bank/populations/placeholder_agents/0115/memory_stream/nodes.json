Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMatthew Stahl: Well, I was born in Chicago, but I grew up in a small town in the East North Central region, which is where I've lived most of my life. My parents were pretty typical for the time\u2014my dad worked in manufacturing, and my mom was a teacher. She had a bachelor's degree, which was pretty rare for women back then, and she always encouraged me and my siblings to value education. I remember growing up in a tight-knit neighborhood where everyone knew each other, and we had a strong sense of community. I went to a public school, and while I wasn't the most academically gifted kid, I was always curious and had a love for learning. I ended up going to college on a scholarship, which was a big deal for my family. I studied political science and later got my master's degree, which helped me land a job in public policy. I met my wife during grad school, and we've been married for about six years now. We have a young daughter, and life has been busy but fulfilling. I consider myself an independent thinker, and I try to stay involved in my community, whether through church or local events.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMatthew Stahl: Yes, there was a defining moment that really shaped the direction of my life. I was about 22, in my second year of college, and I had a choice to make. I had been working part-time at a local community center, helping out with after-school programs for kids from low-income families. It was rewarding work, but I was also struggling with my coursework and feeling uncertain about my future. I had the option to take a gap year and focus on gaining more experience or to push through and finish my degree. My mom, who had always pushed me to value education, encouraged me to stay the course. But I also had a mentor at the community center who saw potential in me and suggested I apply for a graduate assistantship at a local university. That opportunity changed everything. I ended up getting the assistantship, which allowed me to continue my studies while gaining hands-on experience in public policy. That experience not only solidified my passion for the field but also gave me the confidence to pursue a master's degree. Looking back, I think that moment was a crossroads because it forced me to balance my practical needs with my long-term goals, and ultimately, it led me down the path I'm on today.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nMatthew Stahl: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made easily. I had to weigh the immediate need for stability against the long-term potential of furthering my education. I remember sitting with my mom one evening, telling her about the assistantship opportunity, and she just looked at me and said, 'If you're meant to be doing something, you'll find a way to make it work.' That really stuck with me. I knew I wanted to make a difference in people's lives, but I also knew I needed the tools to do it effectively. So I made the decision to take the risk, and I've never regretted it. It wasn't just about the job or the degree\u2014it was about aligning my values with my actions, and that's something I've carried with me ever since.\n\n",

My mom was one of them, but I also had that mentor at the community center\u2014his name was Mr. Kowalski. He had a way of making you feel like your ideas mattered, even if you were just starting out. He didn't just hand me the opportunity; he challenged me to apply for it, to step out of my comfort zone. And then there was the university itself, which had a strong public policy program and offered financial support through that assistantship. I think if I hadn't had those supports in place, I might have hesitated longer or maybe even given up on the idea of going to grad school. It's not something you can do alone, and I'm grateful to everyone who helped me take that first step.\n\n",

Do you have a partner, or children?\n\nMatthew Stahl: Yes, I have a wife named Sarah and a young daughter, Lily. We got married right after I finished my master's degree, and we moved to Evanston so I could take a job with a local nonprofit focused on community development. Sarah is a graphic designer, and she's been incredibly supportive of my work, even though it means we sometimes have to juggle long hours and tight deadlines. Lily is three now, and she's the light of our lives. She's already showing a lot of curiosity, just like I did when I was a kid. We live in a cozy home on Ashland Avenue, and we try to make sure she grows up with the same values my mom instilled in me\u2014like the importance of education, kindness, and giving back to the community. Sarah and I both volunteer at the same community center where I used to work part-time, and it's amazing to see how the place has grown since I was there. It's funny, sometimes I look at Lily and think about how her life will unfold, and I hope she has the same opportunities I did, but even more. Family has always been the foundation of who I am, and I'm grateful every day for the people in my life.\n\n",

Thinking about my childhood, my parents, especially my mom, and the values she instilled in me, I realize how much they influenced the person I am today. The crossroads I faced in college was a pivotal moment that forced me to choose between stability and growth, and I'm glad I took the risk. I'm also reminded of how important it is to have people in your life who believe in you\u2014whether it's family, mentors, or organizations that provide opportunities. Now, as a father, I'm trying to pass on those same values to my daughter, Lily, and I hope she grows up with the same sense of purpose and community that I was lucky enough to have.

Who are they, and what is your relationship with them like?\n\nMatthew Stahl: My immediate family includes my parents, Joseph and Anna Stahl, and my younger sister, Elena. My dad, Joseph, worked in manufacturing for most of his life, and while he didn't have a college education, he always made sure we understood the value of hard work and responsibility. He was the kind of guy who would fix anything around the house, from the plumbing to the car, and he taught me how to be resourceful. My mom, Anna, was the heart of our family. She was a teacher, as I mentioned before, and she had a way of making every student feel seen and heard. She passed that same empathy on to me, and I think it's why I ended up in the field I'm in now. Elena is ten years younger than me, and she's always been the adventurous one. She's a nurse now, working in a hospital in Chicago, and I'm really proud of her. We're close, even though we don't see each other as often as we'd like. Family dinners are still a big deal for us, and even though we're all in different stages of life, we always make time for each other. I think that's one of the reasons I'm so committed to raising Lily with the same sense of family and community that I grew up with\u2014it's something I know is worth passing on.\n\n",

One person who comes to mind is my college roommate, David. We met in our first year, and even though we took different paths\u2014David went into tech while I pursued public policy\u2014we stayed close. He's always been a good sounding board for me, especially when I was trying to figure out my career direction. Then there's my former boss at the nonprofit I work for now, Maria. She's been a huge influence on me, not just professionally but personally. She's one of those people who leads with empathy and integrity, and I try to model my own leadership after her. I also have a few friends from my church community who have been there for me through good times and bad. They've helped me stay grounded and reminded me of the importance of faith and service.

The streets are tree-lined, and there's a real sense of community, especially in neighborhoods like the one I'm in on Ashland Avenue. We're close to Lake Michigan, which is a big part of our daily life\u2014Lily loves going to the beach, and we often take walks along the shore. The town has a mix of older homes and newer developments, and there's a strong emphasis on education and the arts. I've always appreciated how welcoming the people here are, and it's not uncommon to see neighbors stopping by to say hello or offer help. There are a lot of local businesses, from cozy cafes to independent bookstores, and the sense of civic engagement is pretty high.

Tell me about what it\u2019s been like for you living here.\n\nMatthew Stahl: Living here in Evanston has been mostly positive, but like anywhere, there are challenges. One of the things I appreciate most is the access to cultural and educational opportunities. We're just a short walk from Northwestern University, and there are always events happening\u2014art shows, lectures, even community forums on local issues. It's inspiring to see how engaged people are here. That said, the cost of living can be a bit of a strain, especially with Lily in daycare and the mortgage. We've had to be careful with our budget, but it's manageable. I also miss the slower pace of the small town where I grew up, though I think Evanston offers a different kind of richness.

On the harder side, though, the demands of work and parenting can make it tough to maintain a strict routine. There are days when I'm so busy that I skip my morning run or grab a coffee on the way to work instead of eating a proper breakfast. I've also struggled with stress, especially when work gets overwhelming, and I have to remind myself to take time for self-care. But I think the key is balance\u2014knowing that I don't have to be perfect, just consistent. I've learned that even small choices, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator or going for a short walk during lunch, can add up over time.

A few months ago, I was helping Lily set up for a family picnic at the park when I slipped on some wet grass and twisted my ankle. It wasn't a major injury, but it hurt enough to keep me off my feet for a few days. I had to take a couple of days off work, which was a bit stressful since we were in the middle of a big project. I saw Dr. Patel, and he gave me a brace and some physical therapy exercises. It was a reminder that even small things can disrupt your routine, but it also made me more mindful of how I move and take care of my body.

Life has been busy with work, family, and trying to keep up with Lily's growing curiosity and energy. There were times when I felt overwhelmed, especially during the pandemic surge last winter, when everything felt a bit more fragile. I remember staying up late one night, watching Lily sleep and thinking about how fast she's growing. It's amazing how much she's changed in just a year\u2014more confident, more inquisitive, and more independent. At the same time, I've been reflecting a lot on my own journey, especially as I've been mentoring some of the younger staff at the nonprofit. It's funny how the lessons I learned from my mom and my mentors have come full circle. I've also been trying to be more present in small ways\u2014whether it's listening more carefully to Sarah, or taking a moment to really notice the beauty in our neighborhood. I think I've been feeling more grounded than ever before, even with all the challenges. It's not always easy, but I feel like I'm exactly where I'm meant to be.\n\n",

How about for you?\n\nMatthew Stahl: I think I've been fortunate in that I haven't struggled with depression or anxiety in the way that some people do, but I wouldn't say I've been completely free of it. There have been moments\u2014especially during the pandemic\u2014when I felt a bit disconnected, like the world was moving too fast and I wasn't sure where I fit in. I remember one night, after a particularly long week at work, I sat on the porch with a cup of coffee and just stared out at the lake for a while. It wasn't sadness exactly, but more like a quiet exhaustion, a feeling that I was carrying more than I could handle. I think that's something a lot of people go through, especially when you're juggling work, family, and trying to stay present in all of it. What helped me was talking to Sarah, and also leaning on my faith. I've always found comfort in my Catholic beliefs, and I think that sense of connection to something bigger than myself has been a real anchor. I also started journaling more, which helped me process my thoughts and feelings in a way I hadn't before.

How about you?\n\nMatthew Stahl: For me, religion has always been a cornerstone of my life, though I wouldn't say it's the only thing that defines me. Growing up Catholic, I was raised with a strong sense of community, morality, and the importance of service to others. My mom was a teacher, and she made sure that faith wasn't just something we practiced on Sunday\u2014it was woven into the way we treated each other every day. I still find comfort in the rituals of the Church, like attending Mass on Sundays or participating in the sacraments. It's not just about belief for me; it's about connection\u2014to God, to my family, and to the people in my community. I think faith has given me a sense of purpose, especially as a father. When I look at Lily and think about the kind of person I want her to be, I know that the values I was raised with\u2014like kindness, humility, and compassion\u2014are the ones I want to pass on. I also find that being part of a faith community helps me stay grounded, especially during the busier times in my life. There are days when I feel like I'm not doing enough, or when the world feels too big to navigate, and in those moments, I turn to my faith for strength. It's not perfect, and I know there are people who have different views, but for me, it's been a source of stability and meaning throughout my life.\n\n",

I've always been more of a person who prefers face-to-face interactions or phone calls over scrolling through feeds. I do have a Facebook account, mostly to stay in touch with family and old friends, but I don't spend a lot of time on it.

Sarah, on the other hand, is more active online\u2014she uses it for her work and to connect with other designers.

The mortgage is another big one\u2014living in Evanston means the cost of housing is pretty high, even though we're in a nice neighborhood.

For example, during the winter months, our heating bill went up a bit, which is something we're used to, but it still adds up. Then there's the summer, when we use more electricity for air conditioning and we tend to spend a little more on groceries because we're eating more meals at home and trying to keep Lily cool and comfortable. Holidays also bring some changes\u2014like Christmas, when we have to buy gifts, decorations, and maybe go out to dinner with family. We also had a few unexpected expenses, like a new toy for Lily that we didn't plan for, or a sudden repair on the apartment's water heater.

In this role, my most important activities involve conducting research on local policy issues, collaborating with community leaders to identify needs, and helping to draft proposals for new initiatives.

There were a few years in college when I worked part-time at the community center, but that was more of a stepping stone than a second job. After I got my master's and started working at the nonprofit, I made the conscious decision to commit fully to that role because I knew how important it was to be present for both my work and my family. I think having multiple jobs can be overwhelming, especially when you're trying to build a life and raise a child. I've been lucky to have a job that's meaningful and offers some flexibility, so I don't feel the need to take on extra work.

Talking about my stress and how I manage it reminded me of the importance of mindfulness, journaling, and leaning on Sarah for guidance and comfort. It also made me think about how my household manages its finances and how we've learned to be intentional with our spending, even as we navigate the challenges of raising a young child and maintaining a stable income. I feel grateful for the balance we've found in our lives\u2014between work, family, and personal well-being\u2014and I'm reminded that it's okay to not have everything figured out, as long as I'm making progress and staying grounded in what truly matters.",

That comes from my full-time salary at the nonprofit and Sarah's freelance design work. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our expenses and give us a little breathing room. I think what's most important is that we're both working in fields we care about, and that we're able to provide for Lily and each other. I know we could be earning more, but I don't think money is the only measure of success for us. It's about being able to live with purpose, raise a child with love and stability, and contribute to the community we're a part of.

One of the biggest benefits of the job is the health insurance\u2014it covers me, Sarah, and Lily, which is a huge relief, especially with a young child. We also get paid time off, including vacation days and sick leave, which is something I've come to appreciate more as a parent. There's also a generous retirement plan, which is something I didn't think about much when I first started, but now I'm glad we have it. Another thing I really value is the flexibility the job offers. While I do have a standard workweek, there are times when I can work from home or adjust my hours to accommodate family needs, which has been especially helpful with Lily's schedule. I think the most important benefit, though, is the sense of purpose that comes with the work. Knowing that what I do helps make a difference in people's lives\u2014it's what keeps me motivated and grounded, even on the busiest days.\n\n",

My manager, Maria, has been a huge influence on me. She's one of those leaders who leads by example, and she's always been encouraging of my ideas, even when I'm still learning. I remember early on, when I was still figuring out my role, she took the time to sit down with me and talk through my concerns, which really helped me feel confident in my work. As for my coworkers, we're all pretty tight-knit. We've been through a lot together\u2014late nights, tight deadlines, and even some personal challenges\u2014and that shared experience has created a real sense of camaraderie. I think the best part is that we all care about the work we do and the impact it has on the community.

I usually start around 8:00 a.m. and finish around 5:00 p.m., but there are days when I stay a bit later to wrap up a report or prepare for a meeting. What I appreciate most is that the organization understands the importance of work-life balance, especially for people with families. I can often adjust my hours if needed\u2014whether it's leaving a little early to pick up Lily from daycare or working from home when I need to be more present for Sarah or Lily. That flexibility has been a real blessing, especially as a father. It allows me to be there for the important moments without feeling like I'm constantly choosing between work and family.

I think the key for us has been being intentional with our spending and making sure we're both working in fields we care about.

It was one of those old-school factories where the smell of metal and oil was always in the air. He was a machine operator, and his job involved running and maintaining the equipment that turned raw materials into finished products. It wasn't the kind of work that required a college degree, but it was skilled work that required precision, patience, and a real understanding of how the machines worked. He had a way of making even the most complicated machinery feel like an extension of his body. As for my mom, she worked for the local school district, and her job was more than just teaching\u2014it was about shaping young minds. She taught middle school science, and I remember how excited she got when her students asked questions or came up with new ideas. She always said that teaching wasn't just about passing on knowledge, but about inspiring curiosity. I think that's why I ended up in the field I'm in now\u2014because I believe that policy, like education, is about making a difference in people's lives, one idea at a time.\n\n",

Thinking back on my early years in that small town, the influence of my parents, especially my mom's dedication to education and kindness, has had a lasting impact on the values I hold today. The crossroads I faced in college, choosing between stability and growth, was a pivotal moment that set me on the path I'm on now. It's humbling to see how the support of mentors like Mr. Kowalski and the opportunities provided by institutions played a role in my development.

My work in public policy, my relationships with Sarah and my coworkers, and even the daily routines I've built with my family all tie back to the person I've become.
