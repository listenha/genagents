            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Juan Rodriguez reflects on his decision-making process, mentioning that he often trusts his instincts and that it 'just happened' in many instances.

He discusses his career and activism without highlighting exceptional logical prowess, nor does he mention frequent difficulties with logical reasoning. His focus on community service and environmental sustainability suggests he values a variety of skills rather than excelling purely in logical reasoning.

He mentions being busy with meetings, projects, and events, which suggests he is somewhat involved in social and professional settings. However, he also talks about needing to set boundaries and take breaks, indicating that he values his alone time and might find social interactions draining at times.

However, he has also mentioned taking steps to manage these emotions through mindfulness and support from his community. This suggests that while he does experience nervousness, it is not a constant state and he has coping mechanisms in place. Therefore, it seems more likely that he would lean towards the middle of the scale rather than the extremes.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on Juan's responses, he seems to value community service and activism, and his career revolves around planning and executing projects. This suggests he has a structured and practical mindset. However, his participation in community events and activism indicates he does engage in creative and imaginative thinking to drive these initiatives.

            "REI_1": "Based on the interview, Juan Rodriguez seems to have a balanced perspective. He talks about facing challenges in his work and activism, but he also demonstrates resilience and a commitment to problem-solving. His involvement in community service and public activism suggests that he is willing to tackle complex issues, even if he acknowledges that he might not excel at them immediately. This indicates that he is not overly pessimistic about his abilities, but he also recognizes areas where he can improve.",
            "REI_2": "Based on Juan's description and his work as a program coordinator at a non-profit organization, he seems to engage in various projects and initiatives that likely require some level of logical analysis. Additionally, his participation in activism and community service suggests he is capable of tackling complex issues, which often involves logical reasoning. Therefore, it's unlikely that Juan would completely agree with the statement.",
            "REI_3": "Based on Juan's description, he seems to be engaged in a career that involves significant amounts of analysis and planning, such as his role as a program coordinator at a non-profit organization. He also participates in activism and community events, which likely require some level of analytical thinking to plan and execute effectively. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would choose the lowest score of 1.",
            "REI_4": "Based on the interview, Juan Rodriguez described himself as someone who trusts his instincts and relies on his gut feelings when making decisions. He mentioned that he often trusted his instincts during his pivotal career choice, indicating a preference for quick decisions over careful reasoning. His emphasis on trusting his gut suggests he is more like someone who would choose 1.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Juan Rodriguez described facing significant stress due to the complexities of his recycling campaign and the need to coordinate with various stakeholders. He also mentioned using mindfulness exercises and other stress-relief techniques to cope with stress. While he acknowledges the increase in stress levels, he seems to be actively managing it. This suggests he is not completely at the extreme end of struggling under pressure but leans more towards the middle to lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Juan Rodriguez described his work as a program coordinator and the challenges he faces in managing his time and stress. While he is involved in community service and activism, which require problem-solving skills, he also talked about the importance of mindfulness and support from his community. This suggests he recognizes his strengths in logical thinking but also acknowledges areas where he needs support. Therefore, a middle ground seems appropriate.",
            "REI_7": "Based on Juan's background and current role, he seems to have a strong inclination towards logical thinking. His career as a program coordinator at a non-profit organization, involving project coordination, planning, and collaboration, suggests a logical approach to his work. Additionally, his participation in community events and activism requires analytical thinking to assess and address community needs effectively. These factors indicate that Juan would likely rate himself a 5 on this scale.",
            "REI_8": "Based on the interview, Juan Rodriguez has demonstrated a thoughtful and deliberate approach to his career and activism. He has spoken about making decisions based on his instincts and the support of his network, suggesting he values careful thought. Additionally, his involvement in community service and activism shows a measured and considered approach to his work. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that he would rate himself a 5 on this scale.",
            "REI_9": "Juan Rodriguez has shown a strong commitment to his career and activism, which often involves complex problem-solving and strategic thinking. His involvement in the recycling campaign and his ability to manage projects suggest he is comfortable with logical and analytical approaches to problem-solving. Additionally, his decision-making process, such as choosing the non-profit internship over the tech company internship, indicates that he values thoughtful analysis and alignment with his values. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that Juan would lean towards a higher number on this scale.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Juan Rodriguez appears to have a thoughtful and deliberate approach to his decisions. He reflects on his choices and explains the factors that influenced his career path, such as the non-profit internship and his interest in public service. His willingness to discuss the thought process behind his decisions suggests a clear rationale for his actions."
