Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nTiana Johnson: Well, I was born and raised in Chicago, right here in the city, and I've never really left. I grew up in a tight-knit neighborhood on the South Side, where everyone knew each other. My parents were both pretty driven\u2014my dad had a bachelor's degree and worked in education, while my mom went on to get her graduate degree and had a career in healthcare. We were never super wealthy, but we had a stable life, and I always felt supported. I remember being a pretty quiet kid, more into books than sports, though I did love helping out at my mom's job at the clinic whenever I could. I was always told I had a good head on my shoulders, and I guess that's why I ended up going to college. I studied social work, which led me to my current job at a community center here in Chicago, where I help families navigate resources and support systems. I got married in my late twenties to a guy named Marcus, who's a teacher at a local high school. We have a five-year-old daughter, and life is pretty full these days. There have been challenges, of course\u2014like when we had to move to a new neighborhood after the pandemic, but overall, I feel like I've built a life that's true to who I am.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nTiana Johnson: Yeah, there was definitely a crossroads. I was in my second year of college, studying social work, and I had the chance to do an internship at a nonprofit that provided mental health services to underserved communities. It was intense, but it opened my eyes to the real struggles people face every day. At the same time, I had a friend who was working as a corporate recruiter and encouraged me to consider a more stable, higher-paying job in the private sector. I was torn because I really wanted to make a difference, but I also knew that my family expected me to be financially responsible. In the end, I chose to stick with the nonprofit path because I felt like that was where my heart was. It wasn't easy\u2014there were times when I worried about money and job security\u2014but looking back, I know that decision shaped who I am today. It taught me resilience, empathy, and the importance of staying true to your values, even when the road is uncertain.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nTiana Johnson: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made lightly. I spent a lot of time reflecting on what truly mattered to me\u2014helping others, making an impact in my community, and staying true to the values my parents instilled in me. I remember sitting on my balcony one night, looking out over the city, and just feeling this deep sense of purpose. I knew I couldn't walk away from that. It wasn't just about money or stability\u2014it was about feeling like I was doing something that aligned with who I was. I told myself that if I ever found myself in a place where I was just going through the motions, I'd reevaluate. But so far, I've never looked back.\n\n",

My mom, in particular, was a big influence. She worked in healthcare and saw firsthand the impact that community support could have on people's lives. She reminded me that stability doesn't always mean financial security\u2014it can also mean emotional and moral stability. I also had a mentor at the nonprofit where I interned, a woman named Lila, who had been in similar shoes. She shared her own story of choosing community work over a corporate job and how it had shaped her life. Her encouragement helped me feel less alone in making that choice. I think it's important to have people around you who can offer different perspectives, especially when you're standing at a crossroads. Without them, I might have second-guessed myself more than I did.\n\n",

I married Marcus when I was 28\u2014he's a high school teacher here in Chicago, and we met through a mutual friend who worked at the community center where I used to volunteer. We got married in a small ceremony at a park on the lakefront, just family and close friends. It was everything I wanted: simple, heartfelt, and surrounded by people who truly mattered. We have a five-year-old daughter named Aisha, and she's the light of our lives. She's already showing so much curiosity and creativity, and I love watching her grow. Marcus and I have our ups and downs, like any couple, but we both value communication and support, which has helped us navigate the challenges of work, parenting, and life in general.

My mom, Evelyn, is still working part-time in healthcare, and she's the one who taught me the value of compassion and hard work.

We've been through a lot together, and she's always been there to offer advice or just listen when I needed someone.

We've been friends since college, and even though we've both taken different paths, we still meet up regularly for coffee or to catch up. She's one of the few people who truly understands the challenges of working in community services. Outside of friends, I also have a few coworkers at the community center who have become like family.

It's a diverse area\u2014there are long-time residents, newer families, and even some artists and small business owners who have made the area their home. It's not perfect, of course. There are challenges, like gentrification pushing out some of the original residents, and the usual struggles with crime and access to resources. But there's also a lot of resilience here. I love walking through the streets, seeing the murals on the walls, the community gardens, and the little shops that have been around for decades.

There are block parties in the summer, local artists painting murals that tell our stories, and neighbors who know your name and your business. It feels like a place where change is happening, but not in a way that erases the soul of the neighborhood. On the other hand, there are days when I feel the weight of the struggles\u2014like when I see a family struggling to afford groceries or when I hear about a local business closing because of rising rents. It's frustrating, but it also fuels my work at the community center. I want to be part of the solution, not just someone who observes the problems. I've learned to find joy in the small victories, like when a client finds stable housing or when a local teen gets into college.

About a year ago, I started experiencing some persistent back pain that I initially dismissed as just stress or poor posture from sitting at my desk for long hours. But it got worse over time\u2014especially after a particularly busy month at the community center where I was juggling multiple client cases and organizing a new mental health initiative. I finally went to the doctor, and it turned out I had a herniated disc in my lower back. It was a bit of a wake-up call. I had to take a few weeks off work to recover, which was tough because I felt like I was letting my team down. But it was also a chance to slow down and really focus on my body and mind. I started seeing a physical therapist, and I've been doing regular exercises to strengthen my core and improve my posture. It's been a process, but I'm much better now. That experience made me realize how important it is to listen to my body and not ignore the signs.

On the positive side, I've really grown more in touch with myself, especially after my back injury. That experience forced me to slow down and really listen to what my body and mind needed. I've been more intentional about self-care, which has made a big difference in how I show up for my work and my family. I've also felt a deep sense of gratitude for the people in my life\u2014Marcus, Aisha, my parents, Lila, Maya, and my coworkers. They've all been there for me in different ways, whether it was helping me recover, supporting me through the stress of work, or just being a steady presence. That support has been a huge anchor. At the same time, there have been moments of frustration, especially when I feel like I'm not doing enough for the people I serve at the community center or when I'm struggling to balance everything. But I've learned to be kinder to myself, to recognize that I can't do everything, and that it's okay to ask for help. Overall, I feel more grounded and more in tune with what truly matters to me.

How about for you?\n\nTiana Johnson: Honestly, I've had moments where I've struggled with anxiety, especially during the busiest times at the community center or when I was dealing with the stress of my back injury. There were days when I felt overwhelmed, like I was carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders. I remember one particular time when I was juggling multiple client cases, organizing a new mental health initiative, and trying to keep up with family life. I felt like I was constantly running on empty, and it started to take a toll on my mental health. I didn't want to burden anyone with my struggles, so I tried to push through, but it wasn't sustainable. That's when I realized I needed to take a step back and seek help. I started seeing a therapist, and that made a world of difference. It helped me understand that it's okay to feel anxious or stressed\u2014it doesn't mean I'm weak. It just means I'm human. I've also learned to be more open about my feelings with the people I trust, whether it's Marcus, Lila, or even my coworkers. Talking about it has been a huge relief, and it's helped me feel less alone. I still have days when anxiety creeps in, but I'm learning how to manage it better. I've come to see it not as something to be ashamed of, but as a part of my journey\u2014one that has taught me resilience, self-compassion, and the importance of reaching out when I need support.\n\n",

It's not about going through the motions or following rules\u2014it's more about the values that were instilled in me growing up: compassion, humility, and the importance of community.

Groceries are another big chunk\u2014Marcus and I try to cook most meals at home, but with Aisha's after-school programs and my work schedule, we end up eating out a few times a week.

Tell me all about how your bills have fluctuated over the past year.\n\nTiana Johnson: Over the past year, our bills have had their ups and downs, especially with the seasons and Aisha's school schedule. In the winter, our utility bills went up a bit because we were using more electricity for heating, and we had to replace the furnace filter, which added a few extra dollars. Then, during the spring, we had to pay for a new set of tires for the car, which was unexpected but necessary. Around the holidays, we spent a little more on groceries and gifts for family, and we also had to cover the cost of Aisha's school field trips and supplies. In the summer, when the community center was running more programs, I had to work extra hours, which meant eating out more often and spending a bit more on meals. But overall, I've been careful to track our expenses and adjust as needed. For example, when we noticed that our electricity bill was getting too high, we started using more energy-efficient light bulbs and unplugging devices when they weren't in use. It's been a learning process, but I think we've gotten better at managing our money throughout the year, even with the fluctuations.\n\n",

    "content": "Going through the interview questions from 31 to 35 made me reflect on how much I've grown in understanding my own stress, emotional needs, and financial responsibilities. It's been a journey of learning to prioritize my well-being, not just for myself, but for my family too. I used to think that pushing through stress and anxiety was the only way to get things done, but now I see that taking time to breathe, journal, and practice mindfulness is just as important as showing up for my job or my daughter. It's also made me more aware of how my financial decisions impact my peace of mind\u2014tracking our budget, setting aside savings, and being mindful of our expenses have given me a sense of control that I didn't have before. I'm still learning, but I feel more grounded now, more in tune with what truly matters, and more capable of handling life's challenges with grace and resilience.",

That comes from my full-time salary at the community center, which is about $4,000 after taxes, and Marcus's teaching salary, which is roughly $1,200. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our needs and even set aside a little for savings. I've been trying to be more mindful of how we spend, especially with the rising costs of everything from groceries to utilities. It's a tight budget, but we've learned to prioritize what matters most\u2014like Aisha's education, our health, and a little something for fun. I know it's not easy, but I feel lucky that we're able to make it work, and I'm grateful for the stability we've built together.\n\n",

The benefits of the job are pretty standard for a nonprofit\u2014health insurance, which is a huge relief, especially after my back injury. We also get paid time off, including vacation days and sick leave, which I've learned to use wisely. I used to think I could push through anything, but now I know that taking time to rest is just as important as showing up for work. The center also offers some professional development opportunities, like workshops on trauma-informed care or leadership training, which have helped me grow in my role. One of the things I appreciate most is the sense of purpose that comes with the job. It's not always easy, and there are days when I feel overwhelmed, but I know that what I do here matters. I've built relationships with my coworkers, clients, and even some of the local organizations we partner with, and that sense of community makes the long hours and sometimes difficult work feel meaningful.

I have a great relationship with my manager, Sarah, who's been a mentor to me since I started. She's supportive, understanding, and always encourages me to grow both in my role and as a person. She's the kind of leader who leads by example, and I admire how she balances compassion with accountability. As for my coworkers, we've built something like a family here. We all share a common mission, and that bond makes the long hours and sometimes difficult work worth it. We check in on each other, celebrate small victories, and support one another through tough times. I think that sense of camaraderie is what keeps me motivated and grounded in this work.

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nTiana Johnson: My work schedule is pretty predictable, but there's also a fair amount of flexibility, which I really appreciate. I work Monday through Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., but I often stay a little later to wrap up meetings or finish up some paperwork. There are weeks when I'm juggling multiple programs, like the food pantry or mental health workshops, and those can be especially demanding. However, I also have the option to adjust my hours a bit if needed, which helps me balance work with family responsibilities. For example, if Aisha has an early appointment or if Marcus needs to pick her up from school, I can sometimes leave a little earlier or come in a bit later. That flexibility is important because it allows me to be present for my family while still fulfilling my role at the community center. I think the key is that while the core hours are consistent, there's room to adapt when life requires it, and that makes a big difference in how I manage my time and energy.\n\n",

He was always the one you could count on to resolve conflicts, organize events, and make sure students had the resources they needed.
