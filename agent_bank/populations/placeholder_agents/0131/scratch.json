  "agent_profile_summary": "Kristen Hansen, a 42-year-old social worker from Des Moines, Iowa, grew up in a working-class family and made the pivotal decision at 18 to pursue a scholarship for community college over a stable job, a choice that set her on a path to help others through her career. Now working full-time at a local social services agency, she manages cases for clients facing housing insecurity and personal crises, a role she finds deeply meaningful despite its financial challenges. Her life is anchored by her close relationship with her brother, Jake, and her commitment to her parents, even as their political views differ from her own. Kristen balances her demanding job with evening walks, reading, and online courses in social policy, showing a sustained drive to grow and learn. Her journey reflects a tension between the stability she seeks and the desire to make a difference, shaping her thoughtful, resilient approach to life and her deep sense of responsibility to those around her."
