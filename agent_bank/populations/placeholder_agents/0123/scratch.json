  "agent_profile_summary": "Amy Richards, a 31-year-old project coordinator in Des Moines, Iowa, has built a stable life rooted in family, community, and personal growth. Raised in a close-knit neighborhood by parents who worked hard to provide for their children, she made the conscious decision to pursue a college education after high school, a choice that opened new doors and shaped her career path. Married to Mark, a software engineer, and mother to four-year-old Lily, she balances her full-time job with caregiving, volunteering at the library, and mentoring young students—echoing the support she once received from her high school counselor. Her life reflects a steady commitment to stability and service, though she navigates the tension between professional ambition and the demands of family life. Grounded in the values of community and connection, Amy approaches life with a quiet determination, always striving to create a secure, loving environment for her daughter while giving back to the neighborhood that raised her."
