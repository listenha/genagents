Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAmy Richards: Well, I was born in Des Moines, Iowa, and I've lived here most of my life. I grew up in a small, close-knit neighborhood on Prairie Lane, where everyone knew each other. My parents were both hardworking people\u2014my dad worked at a local factory, and my mom was a school secretary. We weren't wealthy, but we were comfortable, and I always felt lucky to have both of them around. I was the kind of kid who loved reading and spent a lot of time at the library. I was pretty shy as a teenager, but I found my confidence through school activities and eventually through my studies. I went to college right after high school, got my bachelor's degree in business administration, and then landed a job at a local company. I met my husband, Mark, while we were both working at the same office\u2014actually, he was my coworker for a few years before we started dating. We got married a few years ago, and we've been trying to build a life together here in Iowa. It's not always easy, but I love the stability and the community feel of this place.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAmy Richards: Yes, there was definitely a crossroads. After high school, I had two main options: go to college or take a job right away. My parents were supportive either way, but I felt like if I didn't go to college, I might be stuck in the same cycle they were in\u2014working hard but not necessarily moving up. I applied to a few schools, and I got into a state university with a scholarship, which made it possible for me to go. I remember sitting at my kitchen table, staring at the acceptance letter, and thinking about how different my life could be if I took that step. I chose to go, and that decision changed everything. It opened doors I never knew existed, and it was the first time I really felt like I had control over my future. I don't think I would be where I am today without that choice.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nAmy Richards: I think for me, it was a conscious choice, but not one I made lightly. I remember talking to my mom that night, and she said something that stuck with me\u2014'If you don't take this chance, you'll always wonder what could have been.' That really made me think. I didn't just decide to go to college because I wanted to get out of my parents' situation, though that was part of it. I wanted to learn, to grow, and to have more options. I remember feeling a mix of fear and excitement, like I was stepping into the unknown, but I knew it was the right path for me. I think that moment was the first time I truly felt like I was taking ownership of my life, and that sense of agency has stayed with me ever since.\n\n",

My high school guidance counselor, Mrs. Thompson, was a huge influence on me during that time. She saw potential in me that I didn't always see in myself, and she encouraged me to apply to college. She even helped me fill out the applications and find scholarships. Without her support, I might have been too scared to take that step. I think it's important for people to have mentors or resources that can help them see possibilities they might not have considered on their own. I try to pay that forward now by volunteering at the local library and mentoring high school students who are thinking about their futures. It's a small way to give back, but it means a lot to me.\n\n",

Mark and I met at the company I worked for after college, and we've been together for almost seven years. He's a software engineer, and while our careers are different, we both value hard work and family. Lily is a bright, curious child who loves drawing and storytelling\u2014just like I did when I was younger. Being a mother has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, though it's also come with its own set of challenges. I've had to balance my job, parenting, and trying to keep our home life stable. Mark is a great partner, and we both make an effort to be involved in Lily's life as much as possible. I think having a family has given me a new perspective on life, and it's reinforced the importance of the choices I made earlier on, like pursuing education and building a stable career.\n\n",

Starting with the story of my life reminded me of how much my roots in Des Moines have influenced my values and the sense of community I cherish. When I talked about the crossroads after high school, it brought back the emotional weight of that decision and how it set me on a path I never could have imagined. Reflecting on whether it was a conscious choice or something that 'just happened' made me realize how much intention and support went into that moment. Thinking about the people who helped me, like Mrs. Thompson, reminded me of the importance of guidance and how I now try to be that support for others. And finally, talking about my family today gave me a sense of pride and gratitude for the life I've built with Mark and Lily. It all ties together to show how my past choices, the people who supported me, and the life I've created are all part of the same story.",

Who are they, and what is your relationship with them like?\n\nAmy Richards: My immediate family includes my parents, John and Linda Richards, and my younger brother, Ethan. My parents are still living in Des Moines, and we stay in close contact. They've always been a big part of my life, even though they've had their own challenges over the years. My dad retired from the factory a few years ago, and he's been helping out around the house, fixing things and gardening. My mom still volunteers at the community center, which is something she's always loved doing. She's a very giving person, and I think that's one of the reasons I grew up valuing service and community so much. Ethan is 28 now and works in sales for a company in Chicago. We don't see each other as often as we'd like, but we keep in touch through calls and visits. He's always been the more adventurous one in the family, and I admire how he's carved out his own path. I think our family dynamic has always been one of support and love, even when things got tough. I'm grateful for them, and I know they're proud of the life I've built with Mark and Lily.\n\n",

Are there people outside of your family who are important to you?\n\nAmy Richards: Outside of my family, there are a few friends who have been important to me over the years. One of them is Sarah, who I met in college. We were in the same business program, and we've been close ever since. She's the kind of person who always knows how to make me laugh, even on my toughest days. After college, she moved to Minneapolis for a job, but we still keep in touch. She's married now with two kids, and while our lives have taken different paths, I still value our friendship. Then there's my coworker, Tom, who's been a great friend and confidant at work. He's one of the few people who can keep up with my sometimes chaotic schedule as a mom and a full-time employee. I also have a few friends from church, and they've been a big support system for me, especially since becoming a mother. I think it's important to have people in your life who you can rely on, who challenge you, and who remind you of the good things in life. Those relationships have been just as important as the ones with my family in shaping who I am today.\n\n",

It's a mix of older homes and some newer developments, and there's a real sense of community here. We have a neighborhood association that organizes events like a fall festival and a summer movie night in the park. I really appreciate how friendly the people are here\u2014everyone waves when they see you, and if you're ever in need of help, someone is always willing to lend a hand. Our street is lined with trees, and there's a small community garden where some of the neighbors grow vegetables and flowers. It's a peaceful place to raise a family, and I feel lucky to be part of it.

I've never had any issues with crime or anything like that, which is something I really appreciate, especially as a mother.

It's comforting to know that if something happens, there are people who care and will help. But like any place, there are challenges too. Sometimes the pace of life here feels a bit slow, and I can get frustrated when things don't change as quickly as I'd like. There are also moments when I feel like I'm stretched thin trying to keep up with work, parenting, and being involved in the community. But overall, I think the good outweighs the bad.

I usually make coffee, read a chapter of a book, and sometimes do a quick yoga session to get my body moving. It's a small way to start the day on my own terms.

It started after I was helping Mark move some furniture in our new home, and I overextended myself lifting a heavy box. At first, I thought it was just a minor strain, but the pain lingered for a few weeks and made it hard to get up in the morning or bend down to pick up Lily. I finally made an appointment with my doctor, and she said it was probably due to muscle strain and recommended physical therapy. I went for a few sessions, and it helped a lot. I also started being more mindful of how I lift things and made sure to take breaks when I'm doing chores around the house. It was a reminder that even small things can take a toll on your body, especially when you're juggling so much. I'm glad I addressed it early, and now I feel much better.

On the positive side, I've really come to appreciate the little moments more. Being with Lily every day, watching her learn and grow, has been incredibly rewarding. I've also found more balance in my own life, whether it's through my morning yoga practice or setting aside time to read. That said, there have been moments of stress and overwhelm, especially with work and parenting responsibilities. I think the pandemic really changed the way I see things, even though we've been back to a more normal routine now.

That said, I've been more aware of my mental health lately.

I think it's important to recognize when you're feeling off and to take steps to address it before it builds up. I've also been more open with Mark about how I'm feeling, and that's helped a lot.

I was raised Protestant, just like my parents, and I still find comfort in my faith. It's not something I think about every day, but during tough times or moments of reflection, I turn to prayer or scripture for guidance. I believe in the values my faith teaches\u2014like kindness, forgiveness, and community\u2014and I try to live by them in my daily life.

I follow a few pages related to parenting and community events in Des Moines, but I don't spend a lot of time scrolling through feeds or comparing my life to others. I think it's easy to get caught up in that, and I've seen how it can affect people's moods and self-esteem. For me, I prefer keeping things more personal and grounded.

My salary covers most of our expenses, and Mark's income helps with the rest. Our biggest expenses last month were rent, which is about $1,200, and groceries, which usually run around $600 to $700 depending on what Lily needs for school and activities. We also have car payments, insurance, and a few other bills like utilities and internet. One of the things I've had to be careful with is saving for Lily's future\u2014like her college fund or extracurricular activities. We also set aside a small amount each month for emergencies, just in case. It's not always easy, especially with the cost of living here in Des Moines, but we've learned to be pretty frugal. I try to plan our meals ahead of time, use coupons when I can, and avoid unnecessary expenses. It's a balancing act, but I feel like we're doing okay.

The majority of that goes toward rent, groceries, and utilities, which are the basics we can't really cut back on. We also have car payments and insurance, which add up, and then there's the cost of Lily's preschool and after-school activities.

Renting was the practical choice for us when we first started our family\u2014it gave us flexibility, especially since we weren't sure how long we'd be in Des Moines or how our careers would develop.

In the winter, our heating bill went up quite a bit, which was a surprise since we're used to the colder months here in Iowa. We also had to budget more for Lily's winter clothes and supplies for her preschool, which added a few extra dollars to our monthly expenses. Then, come spring, we started spending more on outdoor activities\u2014like buying a new bike for her and signing her up for a spring soccer league. Summer brought its own set of costs, like buying sunscreen, swim gear, and a few weekend trips to the lake with friends. And of course, the holidays were always a bit more expensive\u2014decorations, gift exchanges with family, and a nice dinner for Christmas Eve. I've learned to plan a little extra each month to cover these seasonal changes, and it's helped us stay on track.

It's more of a habit than a huge amount, but I think it's important to have that safety net, especially with the unpredictability of life.

That includes my full-time salary and Mark's income from his software engineering job. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our expenses and still set aside some money for savings and emergencies. I've always believed that financial stability is about more than just making money\u2014it's about managing it wisely and being prepared for the unexpected. I'm proud of how we've been able to balance our budget, especially with Lily's needs and our long-term goals in mind. It's not always easy, but I feel like we're on the right track, and I'm grateful for the work we both do to support our family.\n\n",

The benefits package is pretty standard for a company this size\u2014health insurance, dental, vision, and a 401(k) plan. We also get paid time off, which is something I really appreciate, especially with Lily in preschool. I get about 15 days of vacation a year, and I try to use some of that time for family trips or just a few days to recharge. We also have sick days, which has been helpful, especially when Lily is under the weather or when I need to take care of her. The company also offers some wellness programs, like discounted gym memberships and mental health resources, which I've started taking advantage of. I think having these benefits has made a big difference in my ability to balance work and family life, and I'm grateful for the support my employer provides.\n\n",

She's been with the company for over a decade, and she's always been supportive of me, even when I was still finding my footing in the role. She's not one of those managers who micromanages\u2014she trusts her team to do the work and gives us the freedom to problem-solve on our own. That kind of trust has made a big difference in how I approach my job. As for my coworkers, I've built some really strong relationships over the years. We have a good dynamic in our department\u2014everyone is friendly, collaborative, and willing to help each other out when needed. I especially enjoy working with Tom, who I mentioned earlier. He's been a great confidant and a reliable teammate. I think having a positive work environment is just as important as the work itself, and I'm lucky to be in a place where I feel valued and respected.\n\n",

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nAmy Richards: My work schedule is pretty predictable, which is something I really appreciate, especially with the demands of being a mom. I work Monday through Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and while there are occasional late nights when deadlines are tight, it's mostly consistent. My manager is pretty flexible if I need to adjust my hours for family reasons, which has been a huge help. For example, if Lily is sick or if I need to pick her up early from preschool, I can usually talk to my manager and rearrange my schedule a bit. That kind of flexibility makes a big difference in being able to balance work and family life. I also appreciate that my job doesn't require me to be on call outside of regular hours, which gives me a clear boundary between work and home. It's not always perfect, but I feel like I have a good balance, and that predictability helps me plan better for my family and my own well-being.\n\n",

I know we're not wealthy, but I also know that we're not struggling, and that gives me a sense of security.

She was the first person you saw when you walked into the building in the morning, and she was always ready with a smile or a kind word. She also organized events like parent-teacher conferences, open houses, and even the annual school carnival. I remember her staying late after school to help teachers with paperwork or to make sure everything was set up for the next day.

My dad worked at a local factory, and his most important duties involved operating machinery and ensuring that production lines ran efficiently.
