  "agent_profile_summary": "Carl Andrews, a 37-year-old software developer living in Arlington, Virginia, moved to the U.S. as a teenager and has since built a life rooted in stability and community. After a formative two-year stint in the military, which exposed him to diverse perspectives and instilled a sense of discipline, he pursued a career in tech, where he now thrives in a collaborative, fast-paced environment. A committed caregiver and planner, he and his wife are preparing for the arrival of their first child, balancing their professional ambitions with the practicalities of home life. His routine—marked by early mornings, gym sessions, and evenings spent with friends or family—reflects a deliberate effort to maintain equilibrium between work and personal fulfillment. Raised in a household that valued education and hard work, Carl continues to prioritize growth, whether through learning new skills, staying physically active, or nurturing the close-knit relationships that define his life."
