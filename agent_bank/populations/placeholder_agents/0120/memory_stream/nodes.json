    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAshley Mitchell: I was born and raised in the United States, specifically in the East North Central region, and I've always felt a strong connection to my roots. Growing up in a family where my father had a graduate degree and my mother worked full-time, I was exposed to both education and the value of hard work from an early age. We lived in a comfortable home, and while my family wasn't extremely wealthy, we were definitely far above average in terms of income. I remember my parents always emphasizing the importance of faith, and we were devout Catholics, attending church every Sunday and participating in religious activities throughout the year. I moved to Chicago when I was 16, which was a big change for me, but I was able to stay in the same state, which made the transition a bit easier. I went on to earn my bachelor's degree, and I'm currently working full-time in a stable job that I enjoy. I've never been married, and I don't see myself getting married anytime soon. I speak a bit of Spanish from growing up in a community with a lot of bilingual families, and I'm proud of my Scottish heritage, even though I've never been to Scotland myself. Life has been pretty straightforward for me, but I've always tried to stay true to my values and work hard to build a good future.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAshley Mitchell: Yes, there was definitely a crossroads moment for me. It happened right after I graduated from college. I had two job offers: one was a stable position in a corporate setting in Chicago, and the other was an opportunity to work in a smaller town in the same state, but with a nonprofit organization focused on community development. I was torn because the corporate job offered a clear path for advancement and a higher salary, which aligned with my family's emphasis on financial stability. But the nonprofit job felt more in line with my values\u2014helping others, making a difference, and staying connected to my community. I remember talking it over with my parents, and while they encouraged me to take the corporate job for security, I felt a deep sense of purpose with the nonprofit. I chose the nonprofit path, and while it hasn't been as financially lucrative, I've grown so much personally and have been able to give back in ways that matter to me. That decision really shaped who I am today\u2014more compassionate, more grounded, and more committed to living by my values even when it's not the easiest choice.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nAshley Mitchell: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made lightly. I spent a lot of time reflecting on what I truly wanted out of life, and I realized that money and status weren't the only things that mattered. I wanted to feel like my work had meaning, and I wanted to be part of something bigger than myself. I remember sitting in my apartment in Chicago, staring out the window, and just knowing that if I took the corporate job, I might look back one day and wonder if I had missed my purpose. I didn't want to live a life of 'what ifs.' So I made the decision with my heart, even though it meant taking a step back in terms of financial security. I believe that when you make choices based on your values, even if they're harder, they end up being the ones that define you the most.\n\n",

My mother, in particular, was someone I leaned on. She had her own experiences growing up in a working-class family and had always emphasized the importance of doing what felt right, even if it wasn't the easiest path. I remember one evening, after I had been struggling with the decision for weeks, she sat down with me and shared a story about her own life\u2014how she had turned down a job that would have given her financial security in favor of pursuing something that made her happy. Her words really resonated with me. I also reached out to a mentor I had from college, someone who had worked in the nonprofit sector. He gave me some practical advice about what to expect and helped me see that the nonprofit path wasn't as unstable as I feared. In the end, I think having those people in my life helped me make a decision that was both thoughtful and true to who I am.\n\n",

My focus has been on building a stable career and giving back to my community through my work with the nonprofit. My family is still very important to me, though. My parents live in the same state, and we stay in touch regularly. My father is a professor at a local university, and my mother works part-time in administrative support, but she's always been a strong influence in my life. I also have a younger sister who's in college, and we're very close. While I've never been one for big family gatherings, I do value the support and love my family has always given me. I think it's important to have a strong foundation of family, even if your life takes you in different directions. I'm grateful for the family I have and the values they've instilled in me.\n\n",

I'm grateful for the support of my family, especially my mother and my mentor, who helped me see that living by my values is more important than following the easiest route.

My grandmother is a big part of our family dynamic\u2014she's in her late 70s now, but she's still very spry and has a sharp wit that keeps us all laughing. She moved in with us a few years ago after my grandfather passed away, and while it was a difficult transition for everyone, I'm grateful we made the choice to care for her. She's been a source of wisdom and comfort for me, especially during tough times. I remember growing up, she would tell me stories about her own youth in Scotland, even though she never actually visited the country herself. Those stories sparked my curiosity about my heritage, and I've always felt a connection to my Scottish roots through her.

One of them, Sarah, I met in college\u2014we were in the same nonprofit club, and we've been best friends ever since. She's the one who encouraged me to take the nonprofit job after graduation, and she's been my biggest supporter ever since. We don't see each other as often as I'd like because she moved to another state for work, but we stay in touch through regular calls and messages. There's also my mentor, Mark, who I mentioned earlier. He's more of a father figure to me in many ways. He's been guiding me through my career and has always been there with advice, whether I needed it or not. I also have a small group of friends from my church community\u2014some of them are coworkers, others are just people I've connected with through shared faith.

There are some historic apartments, a few small businesses, and a couple of community centers that host events throughout the year.

Mondays are usually my busiest day because that's when we have our team meetings and plan out the week's initiatives. I often start the day early, around 7 a.m., with a quick breakfast and a walk around the neighborhood to get my thoughts in order. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are more about execution\u2014whether it's organizing a community event, meeting with local partners, or helping out with outreach programs. I love the hands-on work, even if it can be exhausting at times. Thursdays are a bit more flexible; I might spend the morning in meetings or on administrative tasks, and then in the afternoon, I like to take a break and catch up with friends or attend a church event. Fridays are usually lighter, but I still have a lot to wrap up before the weekend.

I usually do a short meditation or read a chapter from a book\u2014something that helps me disconnect from the noise of the city and reconnect with myself. I also make it a point to cook at home as much as possible, even if it's just a simple meal. I've always believed in the value of good food, and I think it's one of the few things I can control in a world that can feel pretty unpredictable.

I started doing this a few months ago after realizing how much I was relying on others for emotional support and guidance. I wanted to find a way to connect more deeply with myself and process the challenges I face in my work and personal life. Now, I set aside about 15 minutes each morning before I start my day to write down my thoughts, intentions, and any gratitude I feel. It's been a small but meaningful shift\u2014it helps me stay grounded and reminds me of why I'm doing the work I'm doing.

On the easy side, I live in a city where there are so many options for fresh food, parks, and fitness classes. I love that I can walk or bike to most places, and I enjoy the variety of healthy eating choices, whether it's a smoothie at the local caf\u00e9 or a farmer's market nearby. My routines, like morning meditation and regular exercise, also help me stay on track. But there are definitely challenges too. The fast-paced lifestyle of Chicago can make it tempting to skip a workout or grab a quick, less healthy meal when I'm busy. I also struggle with consistency, especially when I'm overwhelmed with work or personal responsibilities. There are days when I feel like I'm not doing enough, and that can lead to burnout.

About a year ago, I started experiencing some persistent lower back pain, which I initially dismissed as just stress or poor posture from sitting at my desk for long hours. But after a few months of it getting worse, I finally made an appointment with a physical therapist. It turned out that I had developed a minor herniated disc, likely from a combination of my work habits and some old injuries from when I was in college. The physical therapy was tough at first\u2014it required me to do a lot of stretching and strengthening exercises that I wasn't used to\u2014but over time, it got better. I also had to make some changes to my workspace, like adjusting my chair and taking more frequent breaks to stand and move around. It was a humbling experience, but it reminded me how important it is to listen to my body and take care of myself, even when life gets busy. Now, I'm much more mindful of my posture and have incorporated more movement into my daily routine, which has made a real difference in how I feel overall.\n\n",

How about you?\n\nAshley Mitchell: While the back pain did make some days more challenging, especially when I had long meetings or was on my feet for extended periods, it never really got to the point where it affected my ability to work or care for others. I had to learn how to pace myself and take breaks when needed, which actually helped me become more efficient in my job. I also made sure to communicate with my team when I needed to adjust my schedule or take a few extra minutes to stretch. It wasn't easy at first, but over time, I found a rhythm that allowed me to manage both my health and my responsibilities. I think the experience taught me the importance of self-compassion and the value of small, consistent changes. I'm grateful that I was able to address the issue before it became something more serious, and now I'm more aware of how my body is telling me when it needs rest or care.\n\n",

There have been moments of deep fulfillment, especially when I see the impact of our work at the nonprofit\u2014whether it's a student who's found confidence through our mentorship programs or a neighbor who's become more involved in community initiatives. Those moments remind me why I chose this path, and they keep me motivated even on the hardest days.

I've had to learn how to lean into my support system more\u2014whether it's my family, my friends, or my faith.

How about for you?\n\nAshley Mitchell: I think I've been fortunate in that I haven't struggled with depression or anxiety in the way some people do, but I've definitely had moments where I felt overwhelmed or uncertain about my path. There were times, especially during the early days of my nonprofit work, when the weight of responsibility felt heavy\u2014like I was trying to do too much with too little. I remember one particular period where I was juggling multiple projects, and I started feeling like I wasn't making enough of a difference. It was during that time that I realized I needed to take a step back and reconnect with the reasons I had chosen this work in the first place. I started leaning more on my faith, my family, and the small but meaningful routines I had developed, like journaling and meditation. Those practices helped me regain my sense of purpose and reminded me that it's okay to feel vulnerable sometimes. I think the key for me has been learning to ask for help when I need it and to be gentle with myself when things don't go as planned.

They've never been ones to question my choices, but I can tell they've had their own moments of worry, especially when I was juggling so much at once. My mother, in particular, has been my biggest cheerleader\u2014she always reminds me that I'm doing something meaningful, even when it's hard. My father, on the other hand, has been more focused on the practical side, but he's started to see the value in what I'm doing, especially after I shared some stories about the kids we've helped.

My family attended church every Sunday, and we participated in religious activities throughout the year, like Lenten services or community outreach events. Even now, my faith continues to be a source of strength and guidance. I find comfort in prayer, especially during difficult times, and I believe that living with integrity and compassion is a reflection of my beliefs. I also appreciate the sense of community that comes with being part of a faith group\u2014whether it's through my church or the nonprofit work I do, I feel like I'm part of something bigger than myself. That said, I don't see my faith as something rigid or unchanging. I've always believed that spirituality is a personal journey, and I'm open to learning and growing in my understanding of it.

For me, my support has always come from the people I know in real life\u2014my family, my friends, and my faith community. That said, I do think social media can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can connect you with people who share your values or are going through similar experiences, which can be comforting. On the other hand, it can also be overwhelming or even discouraging if you're not careful about what you consume. I've seen posts from friends who are going through hard times, and while it's good to know they're not alone, I also try to remember that online support isn't a substitute for real, face-to-face connection. For me, the real support has always been in person, whether it's a phone call from my mother, a conversation with Sarah, or a prayer with my church community. I think it's important to use these platforms mindfully and not let them replace the relationships that truly matter.\n\n",

The majority of that goes to rent, which is around $1,200, and utilities, which are about $200.

I used to push through without really checking in with myself, but now I make a conscious effort to pause, breathe, and reflect each day. My faith has become even more important to me during these times, offering a sense of peace and clarity when things feel overwhelming. I've also learned the value of setting boundaries between work and personal life, which has helped me feel more in control and less drained. Financially, I've come to accept that my income isn't huge, but I've learned to live within my means and prioritize what truly matters\u2014my community, my family, and my health. I'm grateful for the small but meaningful changes I've made, and I feel more grounded and equipped to handle life's challenges now than I ever have before.",

That's pretty consistent with what I usually earn, give or take a few hundred dollars depending on any extra hours I might have worked or grants we received through the nonprofit. My salary as a Program Coordinator at 'Community Roots' is around $32,000 a year, which covers my rent, utilities, groceries, and other essential expenses. I also receive a small stipend from the nonprofit for travel and event coordination, which helps with transportation and miscellaneous costs. While it's not a huge income, I've learned to live within my means and prioritize what truly matters\u2014like supporting my community, staying healthy, and maintaining strong relationships with my family and friends. I don't have any other sources of income, but I'm grateful for the stability I have and the work I'm doing to make a difference in the lives of others.\n\n",

The organization has a strong mission, and I feel fortunate to be part of a team that's genuinely committed to making a difference. In terms of benefits, we have health insurance coverage, which is something I really appreciate, especially after dealing with my back pain. We also get a certain number of paid days off each year\u2014about 10 vacation days and 10 sick days, which gives me the flexibility to take time when I need it, whether it's for personal reasons or to recharge. The workplace culture is pretty collaborative, and while we don't have the same kind of perks as a corporate job, there's a real sense of purpose and community here. I also get a small stipend for travel and event coordination, which helps with some of the costs associated with my work.

She's been with the organization for a while and has a lot of experience in community development. She's supportive of my work and always encourages me to think creatively about how we can better serve the community. I admire her dedication and the way she leads with both compassion and strength. As for my coworkers, we have a strong sense of teamwork. We all share a common goal of making a difference, and that bond helps us get through the challenges we face. There are a few people I work closely with on a daily basis\u2014like my colleague, James, who handles a lot of the administrative work for our programs. We've been through a lot together, from late nights preparing for events to the highs of seeing our programs make an impact.

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nAshley Mitchell: My work schedule is pretty predictable, but there's also a fair amount of flexibility depending on what's going on with our programs. Most days, I start around 8:30 a.m. and finish by 5:00 p.m., but there are times when I need to stay late, especially if we're preparing for an event or meeting with a partner organization. On the flip side, there are days when I can leave a little early if things are wrapped up and there's no immediate need for me to stay. I also have the option to work from home a few days a week, which is a nice perk, especially when I need to focus on a project or take care of personal matters. That said, I do have to be flexible with my hours because the needs of the community come first. If a student needs extra support or a neighborhood initiative requires more attention, I'm willing to adjust my schedule to make sure we're there for them. It's not always the easiest balance, but I think the flexibility is worth it because it allows me to be present in the work I do and the people I serve.\n\n",

My father was a professor at a local university, and he worked full-time throughout my childhood and into my teenage years. He was always very dedicated to his work, but he also made sure to be present for family events and to support my education.

I think their work ethic and the balance they found between career and family had a big influence on me.

He taught courses in sociology, and his most important activities involved not only lecturing and grading papers but also mentoring students and conducting research on social inequality. He was always passionate about his work, and I remember him staying up late into the night writing articles or preparing for classes. What I admired most about him was how he balanced his demanding career with being a present father. He made time for family dinners, helped with homework, and even took us on weekend trips to museums or historical sites. My mother, on the other hand, worked part-time in administrative support for a local nonprofit, which gave her a sense of purpose beyond just a paycheck. Her most important duties involved managing schedules, coordinating events, and ensuring that the organization ran smoothly. Even though her job wasn't as high-profile as my father's, she brought the same level of dedication and compassion to her work. She was always the one to remind me that every job, no matter how small, can make a difference in someone's life. Their work ethic and values have had a lasting influence on me, and I think that's why I chose a career in community development\u2014because I want to make a meaningful impact, just like they did in their own ways.\n\n",

He often brought his students into the neighborhood for field studies, which gave me a chance to see how academic work could directly impact people's lives. My mother worked for a small nonprofit organization that focused on supporting low-income families with administrative tasks like scheduling services, managing donations, and organizing community events. While her job wasn't as high-profile as my father's, she took pride in the work she did, and I remember her often saying that even small acts of service could make a big difference. Both of them made sacrifices to ensure that my sister and I had the opportunities they didn't, and I think that's why I've always believed in the value of education and community service.

I also hope to maintain the balance I've worked so hard to build between my career, my health, and my relationships.
