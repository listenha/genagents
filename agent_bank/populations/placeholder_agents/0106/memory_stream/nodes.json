    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nBrian Mcqueeney: Well, I was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and I've always had a deep connection to the Lowcountry. Growing up on Magnolia Lane, I remember the smell of the saltwater air and the sound of the gulls in the distance. My parents were both hardworking\u2014my dad was a teacher with a bachelor's degree, and my mom worked as a nurse and went on to earn her graduate degree. We lived in a modest home, but it was always filled with love and laughter. I was the oldest of two kids, and I had a younger sister who's a few years behind me. We grew up in a tight-knit community, and I always felt supported by my family and friends. I went to a local public school, and while I wasn't the most academic student, I did well enough to get into a state university. I studied business, which I thought would be a good path for stability. After college, I landed a job in sales, and I've been working full time ever since. I married my wife, Sarah, a few years ago, and we've built a life together here in Charleston. We have a small home, two dogs, and we enjoy the slower pace of life compared to the hustle of the city. I'm a conservative guy, and I think that's shaped a lot of my views on family, work, and the importance of community. Life hasn't been without its challenges, but I've always tried to stay grounded and grateful for what I have.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nBrian Mcqueeney: Yeah, there was definitely a crossroads. I was about to graduate from college, and I had two offers on the table\u2014one was a stable job with a local company here in Charleston, and the other was an opportunity to move to Charlotte and work for a bigger firm with more potential for advancement. I was torn because I loved Charleston, my family, and the life I had built here. But I also knew that if I stayed, I might be stuck in the same role for years. I talked it over with my parents, and my mom, being the practical one, reminded me that sometimes you have to take a risk to grow. I ended up taking the job in Charlotte. It was tough at first\u2014leaving my sister, my friends, and the familiar surroundings. But that experience taught me a lot about resilience and adaptability. A few years later, I realized I missed the slower pace and the community feel of Charleston. I came back, and I'm glad I did. That decision shaped who I am today\u2014someone who values both growth and the importance of home.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nBrian Mcqueeney: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made lightly. I weighed the pros and cons for weeks, talked to people I trusted, and even went on a few interviews in Charlotte just to get a better sense of what I was getting into. I didn't want to make a decision based on fear or uncertainty. I wanted to make sure I was choosing the path that would challenge me but still align with my values. In the end, I felt like I had the strength to take that step, and I did. I believe in making deliberate choices, even when they're hard. Life is too short to just let things happen without thinking about what you really want.\n\n",

My mom was a big influence in that moment\u2014she had been through her own crossroads in her career, and she gave me a lot of perspective. I also reached out to a few mentors from college who had made similar moves. They shared their experiences, both the good and the hard parts, which helped me see the bigger picture. I don't think I would have made the decision as confidently without that support. It's important to lean on people when you're at a crossroads, even if you think you can handle it alone. Sometimes, the right advice can help you see a path you didn't realize was there.\n\n",

We got married right after I moved back to Charleston from Charlotte, and we've built a life here that feels like home. We have two kids, a son and a daughter, both in elementary school. Our son, Ethan, is into sports\u2014he plays soccer and baseball, and he's got that competitive fire that I think he got from me. Our daughter, Lily, is more of a bookworm; she loves reading and drawing. We have two dogs, Max and Bella, who are like part of the family. Sarah and I both work full time, but we make it a priority to have dinner together most nights and to be there for our kids. Family is everything to me, and I think that's something I learned growing up watching my parents. They always put their family first, and I want to pass that down to my kids.\n\n",

My dad, John, is still living in Charleston\u2014he retired from teaching a few years back and now spends his time gardening and volunteering at the local community center. He's always been a big part of my life, even after I moved away. My mom, Margaret, still works part-time as a nurse, though she's slowing down a bit. She's the one who always keeps our family connected, whether it's through holiday dinners or just checking in on us. My sister, Claire, is a few years younger than me, and she's a teacher now, just like Dad. We're close, even though we don't see each other as often as we'd like. She's married with a daughter of her own, and I love being an uncle to her kid. As for Sarah's family, her parents live just outside of Charleston too. They've been a big support to us, especially when we first started our family. Her dad, Mark, is a retired firefighter, and her mom, Linda, is a school administrator. They've always welcomed us into their lives, and I feel lucky to have them as part of our family circle.\n\n",

One of them is my college roommate, Jake. We were pretty close back then, and even though we went different paths after graduation\u2014he ended up in tech in Atlanta, while I went into sales\u2014our friendship has stayed strong. We still keep in touch, and I make it a point to visit him whenever I can. He's always been the more adventurous one, and I think he helped me see the value in taking risks, even if I didn't realize it at the time. Then there's my pastor, Pastor David, who's been a spiritual guide for me and Sarah. He's helped us navigate some tough times, especially when we were first starting our family. I also have a few coworkers who have become good friends over the years\u2014people I can count on for advice or just a laugh.

It's a mix of older homes and newer developments, but there's a real sense of community here. Most of the neighbors know each other, and it's not uncommon to see people walking their dogs or chatting in the front yards. The streets are lined with oak trees, and there's a peaceful, Southern charm to the place. I live in a two-story house with a small backyard where the kids play, and we have a nice little porch where we sit in the evenings. It's not too far from the beach, which is a big plus\u2014Sarah and I love taking the kids down there on weekends. The local schools are good, and the community events, like the annual festival in the fall, bring everyone together.

I've noticed that some of my friends who moved here from bigger cities have a hard time adjusting to the lack of certain amenities or the more laid-back attitude.

I start my week early\u2014usually around 6:30 a.m.\u2014with a quick workout at the local gym. I've been trying to stay active, and the gym has a good community feel, which helps keep me motivated.

I've started waking up earlier to get the kids ready and make sure we're all out the door on time. I've also been more intentional about meal planning, since we're eating at home more often now.

About a year ago, I started experiencing some back pain after a long day at work, which I initially dismissed as just being tired. But it got worse over a few weeks, and I finally made an appointment with my doctor. Turns out, I had a minor herniated disc in my lower back. It wasn't anything too serious, but it did require some physical therapy and a few weeks of adjusting my routine to avoid aggravating it. I had to take a short break from lifting heavy things at work and focus more on stretching and strengthening exercises. It was a bit of a setback, but it also reminded me how important it is to listen to my body. Since then, I've been more mindful of my posture and have started doing some yoga to keep my back strong. I'm feeling much better now, and I'm grateful that it wasn't something more severe. It was a wake-up call, and I've made it a priority to stay on top of my health moving forward.\n\n",

I had to slow down and take time to recover, which wasn't easy when I had a lot on my plate with work and family. But in the end, it forced me to be more intentional about how I take care of myself, and that's been a good thing. I still have moments where I feel the strain, especially after a long day, but I've learned to manage it with stretches, yoga, and just taking breaks when I need to. It reminded me that health isn't just about being strong\u2014it's about being smart about how you use your body and taking the time to care for it, even when life gets busy.\n\n",

Growing up in a Protestant household, I was raised with strong values\u2014things like honesty, hard work, and the importance of family. My mom was the one who really emphasized faith in our home, and even though my dad was more laid-back about it, he always respected that part of our lives. I remember sitting in church on Sunday mornings, listening to the pastor speak about love and forgiveness, and thinking about how those lessons applied to the world around me. As I got older, I started to see faith not just as something I did on Sunday, but as a way of living\u2014guiding my choices, helping me stay grounded during tough times, and reminding me that I'm not alone in this life. Being part of a church community has also been a huge part of my sense of belonging, especially here in Charleston. We have a strong group of people who support each other, and that sense of connection is something I really value. I don't claim to have all the answers, but I do believe that faith helps me stay focused on what truly matters\u2014my family, my community, and the life I'm trying to build for my kids.\n\n",

I've always been more of a person who prefers face-to-face interactions or even a good phone call. I do have a Facebook account, mostly to keep in touch with family and old friends, but I don't spend a lot of time scrolling through posts or getting caught up in the news cycles.

Last month, our biggest expenses were related to the kids' school supplies, extracurricular activities, and groceries. Ethan's soccer fees and Lily's art classes added up, and we also had to replace some of the furniture in the living room after our dog, Max, knocked over a lamp.

The majority of that goes to housing\u2014our mortgage, property taxes, and home insurance. That's the biggest chunk, and it's something we've always had to be careful with, especially since we're in a growing area where property values are rising.

We were tired of renting and wanted a place where we could put down roots, especially with the kids coming along.

In the winter months, our heating bill went up a bit, which was expected, but we managed by keeping the thermostat a little lower and layering up with blankets. Then, when spring came, we had to pay for the kids' school supplies and uniforms, which added a few hundred dollars to our monthly expenses. Summer brought the soccer and art fees, and we also had to replace the front porch swing that our kids wore out. We also had a few unexpected costs, like a new air filter for the AC and a few minor car repairs. On the flip side, some of our bills were lower than usual\u2014like the electricity bill in the fall when we started using the space heater less.

Talking about my stress levels and coping strategies reminded me of how important it is to take time for myself, whether it's through mindfulness, journaling, or simply talking things through with Sarah or my pastor. It's not always easy to slow down and breathe, but I've come to see it as a necessary part of living a balanced life. At the same time, discussing our household budget and expenses brought me back to the reality of managing a family on a regular income. It's not about having more\u2014it's about being intentional with what we have, making sure we're not living beyond our means, and always keeping our family's needs at the forefront. I've learned that financial security and emotional well-being go hand in hand, and I'm grateful for the systems we've put in place to support both. These conversations have helped me reflect on how far I've come and how much I still have to learn about building a life that's both stable and meaningful.",

Both Sarah and I work full time\u2014she's a nurse at a local hospital, and I'm in sales for the industrial equipment company. Our combined income helps us cover the mortgage, the kids' expenses, and our everyday needs. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to live comfortably here in Charleston, especially since we don't have a lot of the high costs that come with bigger cities. We also try to be smart about our money, setting aside a portion each month for savings and unexpected expenses. I think the key for us is that we're not chasing more\u2014we're focused on what we have and making sure it's enough for the life we want to build for our family.\n\n",

The company offers a solid health insurance plan that covers both Sarah and me, which is a huge relief, especially with two kids. We also get a standard amount of paid time off\u2014about two weeks of vacation, a week of personal days, and sick leave when needed. I think the best part of the benefits package is the retirement plan they offer. It's not a huge match, but it's something that helps us plan for the future. The company also has a pretty good culture\u2014there's a sense of camaraderie among the team, and we all work hard to support each other. I've learned a lot from my coworkers, and I feel like I'm part of something bigger than just my individual performance. It's not a perfect job, but it's one that allows me to support my family and still have time for the things that matter most.\n\n",

He's given me a lot of autonomy in my role, which I really appreciate, and he's been a great mentor over the years. As for my coworkers, we get along well\u2014there's a real sense of teamwork, especially during busy periods. We're all in this together, pushing to meet goals and support each other when things get tough.

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nBrian Mcqueeney: My work schedule is pretty predictable, though there are some fluctuations depending on the time of year and how many deals we're pushing through. I usually start around 8:00 a.m. and finish by 5:00 p.m., but I often stay a bit later on days when I'm finalizing a contract or preparing for a big presentation. The company does offer some flexibility, especially if I need to adjust my hours for family commitments. For example, if Sarah has a late shift at the hospital, I can sometimes leave a little earlier or come in a bit later the next day. That kind of flexibility is really important to me\u2014it helps me balance work with being there for the kids and for Sarah. I also have the option to work from home a few days a week, which is a nice perk.

With both Sarah and I working full time, we're able to cover our bills, save a little each month, and still have some flexibility for things like family trips or unexpected expenses. I think the key for us has always been living within our means and being intentional about what we spend our money on.
