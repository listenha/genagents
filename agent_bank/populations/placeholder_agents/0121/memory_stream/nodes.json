    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nBrian Jackson: Well, I was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and I've been here most of my life, though I did move around a bit as a kid. My parents were both working-class folks who didn't go to college, but they always pushed me to do better. I grew up in a small, tight-knit neighborhood where everyone knew each other, and I remember spending a lot of time playing outside with friends, riding bikes, and exploring the woods behind my house. I was pretty quiet as a kid, more of an observer than a talker, but I had a real passion for reading and learning. I guess that's where my love for education came from. I went to a public high school, and even though it wasn't the best, I managed to get into a state university on scholarship. I studied political science, which was a bit of a surprise to my parents, but I always had a strong interest in how things work in society. After college, I landed a job in public policy, which has kept me busy ever since. I've never married, and I don't see myself rushing into that anytime soon. I enjoy my independence, and I like to keep things simple. I speak a bit of Spanish from growing up around a lot of immigrants in my community, and I've always been interested in learning more about different cultures. Life hasn't been without its challenges, but I've always tried to stay positive and make the most of what I have.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nBrian Jackson: Yeah, there was definitely a crossroads. I was in my second year of college, studying political science, and I had the chance to either stay on the path I was on or take a different route. I had been offered a job at a local nonprofit that worked with immigrant communities, helping them navigate public services. It was a pretty low-paying gig, but it was meaningful work, and I felt like it aligned with my values. At the same time, I had a chance to intern with a state senator's office, which would have given me more political experience and possibly a clearer path to a career in government. I was torn because I didn't want to ignore the needs of the people in my own community, but I also knew that if I wanted to make real change, I needed to be in a position of influence. In the end, I chose the nonprofit job. It was tough financially, and I had to take on extra work to make ends meet, but it taught me so much about the real-world challenges people face. That experience really shaped my perspective and solidified my belief in grassroots activism over traditional politics. I still work in public policy, but I approach it with a lot more empathy and a deeper understanding of the people I'm trying to serve.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nBrian Jackson: I think it was a conscious choice, but not in the way people usually mean. I didn't sit down and make a dramatic decision with a list of pros and cons. It was more like, over time, I started to see the patterns in my own values and the kind of work that truly mattered to me. I realized that I didn't want to be part of a system that felt distant from the people I grew up around. I wanted to be in the thick of it, helping people navigate the same system that had always been a bit of a mystery to me. That choice wasn't just about the job\u2014it was about who I wanted to be and what kind of impact I wanted to have. I think that's why it stuck with me so much. It wasn't just a decision; it was a reflection of who I was becoming.\n\n",

My high school teacher, Mrs. Delaney, was one of them. She was the one who encouraged me to apply for that scholarship to college, even though I wasn't sure I could afford it. She believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. And then there was my friend Marcus, who worked at the nonprofit I eventually joined. He was the one who really showed me what it meant to be grounded in the community. Without people like them, I don't know if I would have had the courage to take that path. I think it's important to recognize that we don't always do it alone, and that the people around us can shape our choices in ways we don't even realize at the time.\n\n",

I've always valued my independence, and I like the freedom that comes with living on my own terms. That said, family is still really important to me. My parents are both in their 60s now, and we stay in touch regularly. They've always been supportive, even if they don't always understand the path I've taken. My mom still works part-time at a local store, and my dad retired a few years ago after working construction. They live in a small town a couple hours away, and I visit them whenever I can. I also have a few cousins who I keep in touch with, and we often get together for holidays or big events. I think family is about more than just blood relations\u2014it's about the people who have been there for you through thick and thin. I'm grateful for the ones I have, and I hope to one day be someone others can count on in the same way.\n\n",

She's a few years younger than me, and we've always had a pretty close relationship, even though we've taken different paths in life. She moved to New York after college to work in fashion, and while I admire her drive and creativity, I think we've always had a bit of a disconnect because of the different lifestyles we've chosen. She's more of a free spirit, always chasing new experiences, while I've always preferred a more grounded, stable life. That said, we still keep in touch, and I think she looks up to me in her own way. I know she's always been proud of me for making my own way, even if our lives don't look anything alike. I respect her for taking risks, and I think she respects me for finding my own path without compromising who I am.

Marcus, the guy I mentioned earlier, is still one of my closest friends. We met in college, and even though we've taken different career paths, we still get together for coffee or go on long walks where we talk about everything and nothing. He's the kind of person who always knows when I need to be reminded of what's truly important. Then there's Lena, a colleague from the nonprofit I worked at. We started off as coworkers, but over time, we became good friends. She's someone who challenges me to think differently and keeps me grounded in the work we do. I also have a few other friends from college who I stay in touch with, though we don't see each other as often as I'd like. They're all people who have helped me grow in different ways, and I'm grateful for their presence in my life.

It's still a tight-knit community, though it's changed a bit over the years. There are more young families now, and some of the old storefronts have been replaced by new businesses, but the sense of community remains strong. I live in a small apartment above a local bookstore, which is run by an old friend of mine, Sam. He's a retired teacher who always had a passion for books, and it's been great to support him in this second chapter of his life. The neighborhood has a real mix of people\u2014longtime residents, college students, and even some artists who have set up studios in the old warehouses nearby. I enjoy the diversity here, and it's always interesting to see how people from different backgrounds come together. It's not perfect, of course\u2014there are always challenges with gentrification and rising costs\u2014but I feel like I'm part of something that's still rooted in the values I grew up with.

Of course, like anywhere, there are moments when things feel tense\u2014maybe a loud argument late at night or a break-in nearby\u2014but overall, I think the community looks out for one another. I've never had any real issues, and I've always felt like I could walk the streets without worry. That sense of safety is important to me, especially since I've never been one for big cities or high-crime areas.

Tell me about what it\u2019s been like for you living here.\n\nBrian Jackson: Living here has had its ups and downs, just like anywhere else. On the upside, I love the sense of community and the way people still take the time to know each other. It's not the kind of place where you just pass by strangers\u2014you wave, you say hello, you might even stop for a chat. That kind of connection is something I really value. Plus, being close to where I grew up means I can still see the changes over time, and it's interesting to watch how the neighborhood has evolved while still keeping its soul. On the downside, the cost of living has gone up, and it's gotten harder to afford things like groceries and rent. I've had to be careful with my budget, especially since I don't have a partner or family to share expenses with. There are also times when I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle\u2014working the same kind of job, living in the same kind of place, and not sure if I'm moving forward or just staying in place.

From what I've seen, many children in our community start their day early, often helping out at home before heading off to school.

I don't need a strict workout plan or a gym membership; I just need to move, even if it's just a few blocks around the neighborhood. What makes it harder is the stress that comes with the work I do.

I used to think I could push through anything, but now I realize that if I don't take the time to rest and recover, I won't be able to keep doing the work I care about. It's funny, because I've always been the one helping others manage their challenges, but now I'm learning that I need to be just as careful with my own health. I've started setting aside time each evening to do the exercises the physical therapist showed me, and I've even begun taking short breaks during the day to stretch or walk around the office. It's not always easy to slow down, especially when there's so much to do, but I've come to see it as part of the job\u2014not just for the people I serve, but for myself too.\n\n",

I think the pandemic really made me realize how much I value the little things: the quiet mornings, the conversations with friends, the sense of community here. I've been trying to be more present, more intentional with how I spend my time. There were definitely moments of stress, especially with the work I do, but I've also found a lot of peace in the routines I've built. I've been gardening more, which has been a real comfort. It's a way to slow down and connect with something tangible, something that doesn't rely on the chaos of the world.

But I do believe in something bigger than myself\u2014maybe the idea that we're all connected, or that there's a kind of quiet strength in the world that helps people through tough times.

My biggest expenses are rent and groceries, which take up a good chunk of my income. I live in a small apartment above the bookstore, and while the rent is reasonable for this area, it's still a significant part of my budget. Groceries can be tight, especially with the rising costs, but I've learned to be pretty careful with my spending\u2014planning meals, buying in bulk when I can, and trying to support local farmers' markets when I have the extra cash. Utilities and internet are also regular expenses, and I've had to cut back on some discretionary spending, like dining out or entertainment, to make sure I can cover the essentials. I also set aside a small amount each month for savings, just in case something unexpected comes up.

I also spend roughly $150 on utilities and internet, and another $100 or so on transportation and miscellaneous expenses like books or supplies for work.

I used to think of stress as something I had to push through, but now I see it as a signal that I need to slow down and take better care of myself. This shift in mindset has helped me find more balance in my life, whether it's through journaling, taking walks, or simply being present in the small moments. At the same time, reflecting on my monthly budget and how I manage my finances has reminded me of the importance of living within my means while still making space for what truly matters\u2014like the people I care about and the work I do in the community. I've always believed in the value of stability, and it's comforting to know that I've built a life that supports both my well-being and my purpose. Even though I don't have a partner or children, I feel deeply connected to my family and the neighborhood I've always called home, and that sense of belonging gives me strength. I'm still learning, but I'm grateful for the small steps I've taken to create a life that feels meaningful and grounded.",

That comes from my full-time job at Community Roots, which pays a modest but steady salary, and the occasional freelance writing gigs I take on. I've always believed in living within my means, and while it's not a huge income, it's enough to cover my expenses and give me a little extra to save or spend on things that matter. I've never been one for luxury, and I think that's why I've managed to stay financially stable over the years. It's not about having more\u2014it's about having enough to live a meaningful life, and I feel like I've found that balance.\n\n",

The benefits of the job are pretty standard for a nonprofit\u2014health insurance is the biggest one, though it's not the most comprehensive plan. We get a few weeks of paid vacation each year, and sick time is something we can use when needed. I also get a small stipend for professional development, which I've used to attend workshops on community engagement and policy advocacy. It's not the kind of job that offers a lot in terms of financial perks, but I've always valued the intangible benefits\u2014the sense of making a difference, the relationships I've built with the people we serve, and the knowledge that my work is contributing to something bigger than myself. I think that's why I've stayed here all these years. It's not just a job; it's a way of life that aligns with who I am and what I believe in.\n\n",

I've been lucky to work with a team of people who are just as passionate about the work as I am. My manager, Lisa, is someone I really respect. She's been with the organization for over a decade, and she has this way of balancing leadership with empathy. She doesn't just assign tasks; she listens, she asks questions, and she makes sure we're all aligned with the bigger picture. I think that's why I've stayed here for so long. As for my coworkers, we've developed a real camaraderie over the years. We're not just colleagues\u2014we're friends who support each other through the ups and downs of this work.

I usually start around 8:30 a.m. and finish at 5 p.m., but I often stay a little later when we're preparing for a big meeting or finalizing a report. The flexibility comes in the sense that I can sometimes adjust my hours if I need to attend a community event or meet with someone in the neighborhood. That said, I do have to be pretty consistent with my time because we're often working on tight deadlines or coordinating with local officials. I think the predictability is what keeps me grounded\u2014it gives me a sense of structure, which is important for someone like me who values stability.

I don't have the kind of debt that so many people my age do, and I've managed to save a little each month, which gives me peace of mind.
