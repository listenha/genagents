  "agent_profile_summary": "Kevin Huang, a 34-year-old Chinese-American resident of Palo Alto, California, moved to the U.S. at age five and grew up in a modest household where his father worked multiple jobs to support the family, instilling in him a deep appreciation for hard work and sacrifice. After earning a bachelor’s degree in business administration and working in the tech industry, he made a pivotal decision to leave his corporate job and return to care for his aging parents following his father’s heart attack. Now, he lives with them, managing their daily needs, small investments, and mentoring young people at crossroads in their lives. His life centers on caregiving, community involvement, and finding meaning in quiet, intentional living. Though he once pursued ambition, he now prioritizes presence and connection, navigating the balance between responsibility and self-care with a steady, reflective approach that shapes how he relates to others and makes decisions."
