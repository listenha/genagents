  "agent_profile_summary": "Jessica Schroer, a 31-year-old marketing professional from Naperville, Illinois, grew up in a modest household where her parents’ hard work and faith instilled in her the values of perseverance and community. A defining moment in her life came when she chose to pursue a college education, despite financial challenges, a decision that opened doors to her career and eventually led her to meet her husband, Mark. Now married and living in the same neighborhood where she grew up, Jessica balances her work in marketing with a commitment to her health, community involvement, and spiritual life. She volunteers at a local food pantry and mentors young women, reflecting her deep sense of gratitude and desire to give back. Her journey—from a first-generation college student to a resilient, self-aware individual—shapes her thoughtful approach to life, where she navigates the tension between ambition and well-being with intention and grace."
