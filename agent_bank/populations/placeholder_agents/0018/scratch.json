Now married with two children, he balances his demanding full-time job with family life, prioritizing routines that include attending church, spending time with his kids, and maintaining a strong sense of community through neighborhood activities and friendships. His career and family responsibilities often create tension, but he remains grounded in his Catholic faith and values, which guide his decisions and interactions. Carlos is deeply committed to providing stability for his family, and his reflective nature shows in how he approaches challenges, often seeking support from both his loved ones and community resources."
