Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nCarlos Martinez: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Mexico City, but my family moved to the United States when I was just a toddler. My parents were both working hard to give us a better life, so we eventually settled in Houston, Texas, where my father got a job at a local factory. Growing up, I always felt a bit of a cultural divide, as my parents were more traditional and wanted to maintain our Mexican heritage, while I was drawn to American pop culture and music. Despite that, we celebrated both Christmas and D\u00eda de los Muertos, which made me appreciate the richness of our dual identity.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nCarlos Martinez: One such moment came when I was around 18 years old. I had just graduated from high school and was deciding what to do next. My parents were pushing me to go to community college and get an associate degree, which would allow me to work and support myself. But I had dreams of going to university and studying something that truly interested me \u2014 economics. It was a tough decision, as it meant taking out loans and potentially delaying starting work. However, I knew that pursuing my passion could lead to a fulfilling career and a better future for my family. So, I took the leap and enrolled in the University of Houston. That choice has shaped my life ever since, and I'm glad I followed my heart.\n\n",

They were hesitant at first, but after I explained my reasoning and showed them my application to the university, they agreed to support me. It was a turning point, and I felt a sense of responsibility to make the most of that opportunity.\n\n",

Additionally, the university itself had various financial aid options and mentorship programs that could have provided extra support.

They both have lunch at school and nap in the afternoon before returning home. Afternoons are when we sign them up for various activities. Sofia loves dance classes, which help her develop her coordination and creativity. Miguel, on the other hand, enjoys soccer practice, which he says is fun because he gets to run around and play with his friends.

Balancing their needs with my professional commitments can be quite challenging. To cope, I've started practicing yoga a couple of times a week, which has been surprisingly effective. It helps me clear my mind and stay focused. I've also found that setting clear boundaries between work and home time has improved our family dynamics. We've established specific times when everyone knows not to disturb me unless it's urgent, which has really helped me manage my workload better.\n\n",

Last month, our biggest expenses included mortgage payments, groceries, and utilities. We also set aside money for Sofia and Miguel's school supplies and extracurricular activities. It's a tightrope, but we manage to keep things together with careful planning and occasional help from Maria's part-time income.\n\n",

Winter heating costs were a bit higher, and we had to replace the air filter in our furnace, which added to the expenses. Summer utility bills went up due to air conditioning use, and we also had to pay for a new pool cover when our neighbor's dog jumped in and damaged the old one.

The support of my family, especially my wife Maria, and the community around us have been instrumental in navigating these challenges. Our shared values and experiences have strengthened our bond, and together we have built a loving family. The interview also highlighted the importance of seeking support from various organizations and programs, which could have provided additional assistance during my transition into adulthood. Reflecting on these experiences, I realize that while there have been ups and downs, the support and love from those around me have made all the difference. This interview has not only documented my life but has also reaffirmed my commitment to balance, support, and the joy that comes from being part of a vibrant community.",
