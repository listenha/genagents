She has acknowledged that she has had to learn how to manage stress through therapy, mindfulness, and support systems. While she has made progress, she has also admitted that stress and emotional weight are part of her daily life.

She has acknowledged the emotional weight of her work and has had to learn new coping strategies, such as mindfulness, therapy, and leaning on her support system.

She also described having panic attacks in the past and has taken steps to manage her anxiety through therapy, mindfulness, and support systems. While she has made progress, she still acknowledges that anxiety is a part of her life that she actively works to manage. This suggests she would not rate herself as a 1 (completely calm), but she also does not seem to experience overwhelming or constant nervousness, so a 5 is unlikely.",

            "REI_1": "Leah has described herself as a social worker who is deeply engaged with her clients and community, showing empathy, dedication, and a strong sense of purpose. She has also reflected on her career path, her challenges with chronic back pain, and her emotional resilience. While she has faced complex challenges in her work, she has consistently shown a capacity to navigate difficulties with support from her faith, family, and community. She also mentions her commitment to learning and growth, which suggests she believes in her ability to handle challenges, even if they are not always easy.",
            "REI_2": "Leah Robinson's interview highlights her strong emotional intelligence, empathy, and commitment to community service, which align more with intuitive and relational problem-solving. While she is clearly capable and thoughtful, she does not emphasize logical or analytical reasoning as a core part of her identity or work. Her focus on compassion, faith, and direct service suggests she may not see herself as particularly strong in logical analysis.",
            "REI_3": "Leah Robinson describes herself as a social worker who focuses on direct client interaction, community outreach, and emotional support. She emphasizes compassion, connection, and lived experience in her work. While she does engage in problem-solving, her approach seems more intuitive and values-based rather than strictly analytical or data-driven. She reflects on her decisions through the lens of faith, relationships, and community impact, which suggests she may not identify strongly as an analytical thinker.",
            "REI_4": "Leah Robinson demonstrates a thoughtful, reflective, and intentional approach to her life and work. She often discusses how she carefully considers her decisions, reflects on her values, and plans her routines. She also shows a deep understanding of her own emotional and physical health, which suggests she engages in careful reasoning. This makes it unlikely she would rate herself low on this scale.",
            "REI_5": "Leah describes her work as emotionally demanding and often involving crisis situations, which would require her to reason under pressure. She also mentions mindfulness practices and self-care, indicating she is aware of stress and manages it. However, she does not express any difficulty in reasoning under pressure, and her job as a social worker likely requires her to handle pressure effectively.",
            "REI_6": "Leah Robinson describes herself as someone deeply connected to her community, guided by values, faith, and compassion. She emphasizes emotional intelligence, mindfulness, and relational support in her work and life. While she is thoughtful and reflective, she does not present herself as someone who primarily relies on logical reasoning. Instead, she often speaks about faith, intuition, and the importance of relationships in guiding her decisions.",
            "REI_7": "Leah describes herself as someone who values compassion, connection, and community. She often speaks about her faith, relationships, and the emotional impact of her work as a social worker. While she does show some analytical thinking (e.g., in budgeting, planning, and reflecting on her career choices), her narrative is more centered on emotional intelligence, intuition, and empathy rather than a strong emphasis on logical reasoning. This suggests she is more likely to identify with the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_8": "Leah Robinson demonstrates a thoughtful and reflective nature throughout the interview. She carefully considers her career choices, values self-care, and reflects deeply on her life experiences and decisions. She also shows a strong inclination to think through her actions and their impact, as seen in her decision-making process and her emphasis on mindfulness and intentionality.",
            "REI_9": "Leah Robinson emphasizes her faith, emotional connections, and community support as central to her life. She describes making decisions based on values, purpose, and spiritual guidance, such as when she chose to work directly with people in need rather than pursue a graduate degree. While she is thoughtful and reflective, her decision-making seems more aligned with intuition, empathy, and faith rather than strict logic.",
            "REI_10": "Leah frequently reflects on her decisions, especially major life choices like her career path and personal values. She often explains her decisions in detail, such as when she chose to work directly with people in need over pursuing a graduate degree in public policy. She emphasizes the importance of aligning her actions with her values and has a clear sense of purpose. This suggests she has clear, explainable reasons for her decisions."
