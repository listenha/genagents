  "agent_profile_summary": "Leah Robinson, a 30-year-old social worker in Dallas, was raised in a small town in the West South Central region, where her parents' careers in academia and healthcare instilled in her a deep appreciation for education and service. After graduating, she chose to work directly with at-risk youth and families in crisis rather than pursue a graduate degree in public policy, a decision shaped by her desire to make immediate, tangible impacts in her community. Now living in Oak Lawn, she balances her demanding job with a commitment to her faith, family, and self-care, often incorporating mindfulness and walking to work into her routine. Her life is guided by a strong sense of purpose and connection, evident in her dedication to her clients, her active role in her church, and her efforts to address community challenges like gentrification and housing insecurity. Leah's journey reflects a continuous balance between her professional responsibilities and her personal values, driven by a belief in compassion, growth, and the power of community."
