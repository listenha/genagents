While I enjoy the genre and find it thrilling when done well, I also recognize that not all horror movies are equally scary or engaging. Based on my experiences, a horror movie is more likely to fall closer to the 'scared to death' end of the spectrum, as it is designed to provoke fear. However, I also know that some horror movies can be predictable or unoriginal, which might push them toward the 'bored to death' side. Overall, I would place it around the middle to slightly higher end of the spectrum, as it's more likely to be scary than boring."

While it implies a setting that is not home, the mention of 'candle light' often evokes warmth, comfort, and a sense of familiarity. This makes me think it leans more toward homesickness, as it hints at a longing for comfort or a sense of belonging, even in a new place. However, it doesn't strongly suggest a desire to explore or wander, so it's not fully on the wanderlust side. It feels like a subtle mix, but closer to homesickness."

Given that I have a bachelor's degree in business administration and have used math in my marketing career, I see it as a subject that is neither entirely simplistic nor entirely complex, but somewhere in between.

My values around family, community, and personal connection make me lean toward seeing a hand-written note as a warm and fuzzy gesture."
