  "agent_profile_summary": "Linda Peacock, a 35-year-old marketing coordinator in Charleston, South Carolina, grew up in a close-knit family that emphasized education and stability, values she carries into her life today. She chose to stay in the U.S. during her junior year of college rather than study abroad, a decision that reinforced her commitment to building a secure future for herself and her family. Now married with two children, she lives in the same neighborhood where she grew up, valuing the sense of community and the familiar rhythms of small-town life. A dedicated mother and community member, she balances her full-time job with volunteering and supporting local initiatives. Her life reflects an ongoing tension between the comfort of stability and the quiet curiosity about what might have been, shaping her thoughtful approach to both her family and her work."
