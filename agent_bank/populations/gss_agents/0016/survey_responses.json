            "BFI-10_1": "Based on Shane's responses, he seems to be someone who values personal growth and meaningful work, but also acknowledges the challenges of his current situation. His tendency to focus on personal development, mindfulness, and self-care suggests a reflective and introspective personality. While he does engage in social media and has some interactions, the overall tone of his responses indicates a preference for quieter, more thoughtful activities. This aligns more with a reserved personality.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Shane seems to be someone who values relationships and meaningful connections, even though he currently struggles with forming them. His desire to reconnect with family and friends and his openness to meeting new people suggest he has a trusting nature. Additionally, he mentions trying to practice mindfulness and meditation, which can foster a sense of openness and trust. While he does express some frustration and anxiety, his overall outlook and values point towards a more trusting personality.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Shane's interview, he describes himself as someone who is currently struggling to find a stable career and is focused on job applications and personal development. His frustration and the constant uncertainty suggest that he may feel somewhat passive and resistant to taking on new tasks, which could indicate a tendency towards laziness. However, Shane also shows a strong drive to overcome his current situation and find a meaningful career, which suggests he is not entirely lazy. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems most fitting.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on Shane's interview, he has expressed feelings of frustration, anxiety, and depression, especially during the past year. He has also mentioned that his stress levels have been high and that he finds it challenging to manage stress. This indicates that he would more closely align with the lower end of the range.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Shane does not mention having any artistic interests. He talks about his academic pursuits and career aspirations, which are more focused on social work and personal development rather than art. His lifestyle in Old Town and his current job search do not indicate involvement in artistic activities. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that he would lean towards agreeing with the statement that he has few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Shane describes himself as someone who has struggled to maintain close relationships and focuses more on personal growth and career exploration rather than socializing. He mentions drifting apart from friends and not having strong social connections. This suggests he might lean towards being more introverted or reserved in social situations.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on Shane's reflections, he describes himself as someone who is struggling with stress and uncertainty. He mentions feeling overwhelmed and sometimes anxious, which might lead to a more critical mindset towards others. However, he also emphasizes the importance of forming meaningful connections and supporting others, indicating a generally positive outlook. Given these factors, it seems more likely that Shane would slightly agree with the statement but not strongly agree.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on the interview, Shane describes himself as someone who is still searching for a stable career and facing many challenges. Despite these difficulties, he expresses a desire for personal growth and meaningful work. His pursuit of a career in social work indicates a commitment to thoroughness and detail, as well as a strong sense of responsibility. Therefore, it is more likely that Shane sees himself as someone who does a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on Shane's interview, he has expressed struggles with depression and anxiety, especially during his job search and other uncertain periods. His descriptions of feeling overwhelmed and stressed indicate that he does experience nervousness and anxiety. However, he has also mentioned that he tries to cope and manage these feelings, suggesting he is not constantly in a state of extreme nervousness. Therefore, a moderate level of nervousness seems more fitting.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on Shane's responses, he seems to value concrete actions and practical solutions over abstract ideas. He focuses more on his career search and personal development rather than engaging in imaginative pursuits. His descriptions of his day-to-day activities and his current state of mind suggest a more grounded and realistic approach to life. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that Shane would lean towards the lower end of the scale."

His struggle with forming deep relationships and his emphasis on the importance of support from family and friends suggest that he values empathy and understanding. This indicates that he would likely be able to understand his friend's happiness when they do well at something.",
            "BES-A_2": "Based on Shane's reflections, he mentions feeling isolated and having difficulty building strong connections with others. This suggests that he may not be as attuned to the emotions of his friends, which aligns more with someone who would choose 5. Additionally, Shane expresses frustration with the lack of meaningful connections and the challenge of understanding his friends' emotional states.",
            "BES-A_3": "Based on Shane's interview, he has expressed feelings of depression and anxiety during his job search. He has also mentioned turning to social media for emotional support and understanding the feelings of others who are in similar situations. This indicates that he has some level of empathy and understanding towards others who are feeling down. However, his struggles and the stress of his current situation suggest that he may find it challenging to fully empathize at all times. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that he would lean towards the higher end of the scale but not the maximum.",
            "BES-A_4": "Based on the interview, Shane has struggled with forming deep, meaningful connections with others. He mentions drifting apart from college friends and having a somewhat distant relationship with his parents and siblings. This suggests he might not be as adept at picking up on subtle emotional cues from his friends. Additionally, Shane focuses more on his own struggles and goals, indicating he may not be as attuned to the emotions of others. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume he would score lower on this scale.",
            "BES-A_5": "Based on the interview, Shane seems to value personal growth and meaningful interactions, which suggests he is likely attuned to the emotions of others. He has mentioned dealing with stress and seeking support, indicating a need for and possibly a talent for understanding others' emotions. His openness to forming deeper connections and his awareness of his own emotional state point towards a higher capacity for empathy.",
            "BES-A_6": "Based on Shane's description, he is a reflective individual who values personal growth and meaningful connections. His interest in social work and his efforts to form deeper connections suggest that he is attentive to others' emotions and values understanding people.

            "BES-A_7": "Based on the interview, Shane has expressed a deep interest in understanding people and their motivations, particularly through his choice of a career in social work. His desire to make a meaningful difference in people's lives suggests he is attuned to their emotions and needs. While he has experienced some challenges in forming close relationships, his background in sociology and his introspective nature suggest he has a good grasp on human behavior and emotional states.",
            "BES-A_8": "Based on Shane's responses, he describes himself as someone who is currently struggling with stress and anxiety due to his job search and personal life challenges. He mentions turning to social media for emotional support but notes that it's hard to form deeper connections. This suggests that while he does value support and understanding from his family and friends, he may not always be aware of their feelings, especially given his current focus on his own challenges.",
            "BES-A_9": "Based on Shane's interview, he describes himself as someone who is focused on his career and personal growth, and mentions that he hasn't maintained close friendships from college. This suggests he might struggle with interpreting his friends' emotions, especially if he hasn't been actively engaged with them recently. Therefore, it's more likely that Shane would choose a lower number on the scale."

His statements indicate a lack of confidence in his problem-solving abilities.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Shane describes himself as someone who is currently focused on job searching and personal development, which involves a lot of uncertainty and stress. He mentions that he sometimes feels overwhelmed and struggles with the constant job hunt, indicating that he might not be very good at solving problems that require careful logical analysis.

He mentions that he majored in sociology and found it meaningful, but he does not explicitly describe himself as analytical or detail-oriented. His emphasis on finding a sense of purpose and meaning suggests a more intuitive and less analytical approach to life. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that Shane would lean towards the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_4": "Based on Shane's interview, he describes himself as someone who has been struggling with the uncertainty of his job search and the constant need to push forward without a clear path. His statements indicate a tendency to feel overwhelmed and sometimes act impulsively rather than carefully reason through situations. For example, he mentions feeling frustrated and overwhelmed, suggesting he might make decisions based on immediate emotions rather than careful reasoning.",
            "REI_5": "Based on Shane's interview, he has experienced significant stress and uncertainty, particularly with his job search. He mentions feeling overwhelmed and frustrated, which suggests he might find it challenging to reason well under pressure. Additionally, his tendency to feel anxious and stressed is evident, indicating that he likely falls towards the higher end of the scale.",
            "REI_6": "Based on Shane's interview, he has a background in sociology and has shown an interest in understanding societal interactions and patterns. However, his current focus is on job searching and personal development, indicating he may not have recent experience with logical reasoning tasks. He also mentioned that he is currently unemployed and struggling to find his footing, which suggests he might not be as confident in his logical abilities compared to most people. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that Shane would choose a lower score on this scale.",
            "REI_7": "Shane O'Donnell appears to be introspective and values personal growth and meaningful work over purely logical pursuits. His focus on social work and his desire to make a difference suggest that he is more driven by empathy and social impact rather than strict logical analysis. While he does value hard work and education, which involve some logical thinking, his primary motivations seem to be more aligned with helping others and personal development.",
            "REI_8": "Based on Shane's comments throughout the interview, he seems to value thoughtful and considered actions. He mentions making decisions after shadowing professionals and reflecting on his values and aspirations, which suggests he puts effort into thinking things through carefully. Additionally, his desire for a stable and fulfilling career in social work indicates a commitment to thorough consideration and planning.",
            "REI_9": "Shane has a background in sociology and a passion for making a difference in people's lives. His analytical skills from his academic pursuits suggest that he is capable of logical thinking. However, the uncertainty and stress of his current job search might cause him to feel less confident in his problem-solving abilities.

            "REI_10": "Based on Shane's description, he seems to value personal growth and meaningful work, which suggests he is thoughtful and reflective. However, he also mentions that sometimes he feels overwhelmed and struggles with making progress, indicating that his decision-making might not always be as clear-cut or planned out. Given his emphasis on the importance of reflection and his current struggles, it is reasonable to assume that while he generally tries to be deliberate, he might sometimes lack clear, explainable reasons for his decisions, especially during challenging times like his job search."

His struggle with forming deeper, more meaningful connections suggests he might be more reserved than outgoing. Additionally, his focus on self-care and mindfulness indicates a preference for introspective and solitary activities. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Shane would identify more with being reserved rather than not reserved.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Shane O'Donnell appears to have had a relatively stable upbringing with parents who were both working and pursuing education, which could foster a sense of trust and stability. Additionally, he seems to value personal connections and meaningful work, indicating a generally positive outlook towards others. While he has faced challenges in his job search and may have some insecurities, his desire to build stronger connections and his reflection on the importance of trust suggest a tendency towards trust rather than extreme skepticism.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on the interview, Shane describes himself as someone who is actively job searching and trying to find a stable career path. He mentions that he is trying to stay positive, keep pushing forward, and make progress. This indicates that he is not someone who sees himself as lazy, but rather as someone who is working hard and making efforts towards his goals. While he does express some frustration and difficulty in maintaining a stable routine, his actions suggest a strong drive to overcome these challenges. Therefore, it is unlikely that Shane would see himself as someone who is lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on Shane's description, he has experienced significant stress and anxiety due to his job search and general uncertainty in life. He mentions feeling overwhelmed and dealing with depression and anxiety, which suggests he does not handle stress well. Furthermore, his daily routine is inconsistent and filled with job searching, which adds to his stress levels. Therefore, it is more likely that Shane would identify himself as someone who struggles to handle stress well.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on Shane's description, he seems to have focused more on academic and professional pursuits rather than artistic interests. He mentions that he majored in sociology and was initially unsure about his future until he found his passion in social work. His current focus appears to be on job searching and personal development, which suggests he may not have many artistic interests. However, since he does not explicitly deny having any artistic interests, we cannot assume he has none. Given the context, it seems more plausible that he has fewer artistic interests than a typical person, but not necessarily zero.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Shane describes himself as someone who has been focusing on his career and personal development, and he mentions not having many close friends or relationships. He also states that he hasn't maintained close connections with his family or friends. This suggests that Shane is more introverted and prefers to focus on his own goals rather than social interactions, which aligns more with choosing a lower number on the scale.",

He describes himself as feeling uncertain and stressed, which suggests he may not be as thorough in his work as he would like to be. He also mentions that he's been applying for jobs and networking, which can be time-consuming and may lead to rushing. However, given his educational background and interest in making a difference, he likely values thoroughness and quality in his work, even if he's not always achieving it in practice.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Shane O'Donnell describes himself as struggling with feelings of depression and anxiety, especially during job searches. He mentions using mindfulness and meditation to cope with stress, indicating he does experience nervousness and anxiety. However, he also describes himself as trying to stay positive and motivated, suggesting he is not completely overwhelmed by these emotions. Therefore, it seems likely that he falls somewhere in the middle of the range, but leaning towards the higher end due to his experiences with anxiety.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on Shane's interview, he appears to be someone who values practicality and often focuses on the here and now. His emphasis on his job search and the need for a stable routine suggests he values realism and pragmatism.

            "BES-A_3": "Based on Shane's comments, he has experienced significant emotional challenges, including depression and anxiety. His reflection on the interview indicates a struggle with mental health and a recognition of the impact of stress and uncertainty. Given his acknowledgment of the emotional toll and the importance of seeking support, it suggests he has a level of empathy and emotional awareness, even if it's not perfect. This inclination towards understanding others' feelings, albeit with some difficulty, leans him more towards the higher end of the scale.",

Additionally, his reflections on his relationships and interactions with others indicate a more practical, goal-oriented mindset rather than an empathetic one. However, Shane does mention that he has tried to form connections and seek support from others, which shows a modicum of emotional awareness, albeit not necessarily at the highest level.",
            "BES-A_6": "Based on Shane's interview, he described himself as someone who is introspective and prefers to think for himself. He mentioned that he forms his own opinions and tends to be independent, which suggests he might be more focused on his own emotions rather than those of others.

            "BES-A_8": "Based on Shane's responses, he mentions feeling a bit isolated and lacking strong social connections. He also discusses the challenges of maintaining friendships and feeling somewhat disconnected from his family and friends.

However, there's no explicit mention of his proficiency in logical reasoning. Given his focus on social work and his current struggle with job applications, it suggests he might not be overly confident in his logical reasoning skills. Nonetheless, he's shown a willingness to engage in structured activities like job applications and networking, which require some level of logical thinking. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that he would lean towards the middle of the scale.",
            "REI_7": "Based on Shane's description, he seems to value personal growth and meaningful work, which suggests he might be reflective and analytical. However, the interview does not provide explicit evidence of him being highly logical or analytical. Given that he is currently job searching in a field that requires critical thinking (social work), it's reasonable to assume he values logic to some extent, but not necessarily to the highest degree.",
            "REI_8": "Based on Shane's description, he mentions that his days are filled with uncertainty and the constant search for a stable routine. This suggests that he often deals with stressful and chaotic situations, which might lead him to feel more rushed and less careful in his thinking. Additionally, his struggles with job searching and maintaining a routine indicate that he might not be in the habit of carefully thinking through complex decisions. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that Shane would lean towards the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_9": "Shane describes himself as someone who has been thinking about his future for a long time and has had to make significant decisions, such as choosing a career path. His experiences suggest he values and relies on logical reasoning to navigate life's complexities. Given his reflective and analytical nature, it is reasonable to assume that he would rate his ability to use logic highly.",
            "REI_10": "Based on Shane's reflection in the interview, he mentions that the decision to pursue a career in social work was a blend of contemplation and sudden insight. This suggests that while he values thoughtful consideration, he also acknowledges moments of clarity and inspiration that led to key decisions. This balance leans towards a preference for both logical and intuitive processes, but not necessarily to the extremes of either end of the spectrum."

His tendency to think for himself and form his own opinions suggests a preference for solitude or at least a moderate level of comfort with being reserved. Additionally, his current situation, with a focus on job searching and self-care, implies a level of introspection and perhaps a desire for quiet reflection, which aligns more with being reserved.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Shane seems to value personal growth and meaningful work, and he expresses a desire for strong relationships. However, he also mentions feeling isolated and facing challenges with his job search, which might lead to some skepticism. Still, his overall openness to connecting with people and his commitment to finding a fulfilling career suggest he leans towards trusting others, albeit with some reservations.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Shane's interview, he appears to be someone who is actively job searching and trying to find his path in life, which suggests he is quite motivated and proactive. He mentions that he tries to stay positive and keep pushing forward, even though he finds it challenging. This indicates that he is not someone who views himself as lazy or easily giving up on his goals.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Shane has expressed significant stress and anxiety related to his job search and overall life situation. He mentions struggling with depression and anxiety, and finding it hard to stay motivated and maintain a stable routine. These factors suggest that he would likely rate himself lower on the scale, indicating that he does not see himself as someone who handles stress well.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Shane O'Donnell describes himself as someone who is focused on his career and personal development, and mentions that he hasn't really had many close friends or social connections outside of work-related activities. He also indicates that he has been focusing on job searching and personal growth, suggesting that he doesn't have a lot of time or interest in pursuing artistic hobbies. Given his current situation and priorities, it seems more likely that he would identify with having few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Shane seems to struggle with maintaining close relationships and has a somewhat isolated lifestyle. He mentions drifting apart from friends and not having many close connections, which suggests a more introverted personality. While he values personal growth and relationships, his current situation and focus on job searching indicate a preference for introspection and self-care over frequent social engagements. However, his desire to reconnect with family and friends and join a group to meet new people shows some level of sociability.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview transcript, Shane describes himself as someone who is liberal and focuses on personal growth and meaningful work. His statements suggest he values understanding and personal development, rather than being critical or judgmental. He also mentions wanting to form closer connections and be supportive, which indicates a tendency towards positivity rather than finding fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on the interview, Shane has a history of feeling uncertain and overwhelmed, which might lead to rushing through tasks or missing details. However, his passion for social work and desire to make a meaningful impact suggests that he cares about doing his work well. While he hasn't had a steady job in a while, his commitment to finding the right fit and his interest in social work indicate that he values thoroughness and quality in his work.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview transcript, Shane O'Donnell has expressed feelings of frustration, anxiety, and depression in response to the challenges he faces in his job search and overall life circumstances. These emotions suggest that he does experience nervousness and anxiety, particularly during stressful times. However, it's not clear from the transcript if these feelings are pervasive or if they are more situational. Given his experience with job searching and the stress it brings, it seems likely that he would rate himself higher than 1 but not necessarily at the highest point of 5.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on Shane's background and current situation, it seems unlikely that he would rate himself as extremely imaginative (5). His focus on job searching and personal development suggests that he values practical, structured approaches to achieving his goals. While he does mention that he enjoys learning about society and has found his passion in social work, there's no indication of him being particularly imaginative or creative in his daily life. However, he does express a desire for meaningful work and personal growth, which could hint at a more nuanced view of his imagination. Given his current struggles and the practical nature of his pursuits, a rating of 3 might be more fitting, but leaning towards the lower end of the scale, a 2 seems more appropriate."

He mentions that he has not had many close friends outside of college and that he has been focusing on his career and personal development. This suggests that he might find it harder to understand his friends' emotions, especially if they are more complex or subtle. Given this, it seems more likely that Shane would choose a higher number on the scale, indicating that he finds it harder to know when his friends are frightened.",

He has also mentioned the importance of forming deeper connections and understanding others' experiences through social media.

Additionally, he has been relying on social media to find emotional support, which indicates he can recognize emotional states in others, even if not explicitly stated.

He has expressed feelings of isolation and has mentioned turning to social media for emotional support rather than building deep, meaningful connections in person.

            "BES-A_8": "Based on Shane's interview, he mentions that he hasn't maintained close friendships recently and is focused on his career and personal growth. This suggests that he might not be as attuned to his friends' feelings as someone who prioritizes social connections. Shane also describes feeling isolated and lacking strong social connections, which further supports the idea that he is not usually aware of his friends' feelings.",
            "BES-A_9": "Based on Shane's reflections, he mentions feeling isolated and lacking strong social connections. He also notes difficulty in maintaining close friendships and struggling with the current state of his social network.

He also mentions that he majored in sociology and loved learning about society and how people interact, suggesting an interest in analyzing human behavior. Given this, it's likely that Shane leans towards valuing analytical thinking rather than relying solely on intuition.",

He mentions trying to cope with stress through mindfulness and meditation, but also notes that he sometimes feels like there's too much to handle. This suggests he might lean towards making decisions quickly rather than taking the time to reason things out carefully, as he often feels rushed or unsure. Therefore, it's more likely that Shane would choose 1.",

Given his focus on personal growth and his sociological background, it's possible he might have some interest in arts, even if it's not a primary focus in his life.

Given his current struggles and the complexity of his situation, it's reasonable to assume he would lean towards the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Shane describes himself as extremely liberal and someone who has been struggling with job searches and personal growth. His current situation involves a lot of uncertainty and stress, which suggests he might not be in the best mental state to engage in detailed logical analysis. Additionally, his reflections indicate that he is currently focusing on personal development and finding his path, rather than excelling in analytical tasks. This aligns more with the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Shane describes himself as someone who is focused on personal growth and meaningful work, rather than engaging in analytical thinking. He mentions that he prefers to think for himself and form his own opinions, which suggests a more intuitive approach to problem-solving. Furthermore, his emphasis on social work and helping others indicates a preference for emotional and interpersonal interactions over analytical processes.",
            "REI_4": "Based on the interview, Shane O'Donnell describes himself as someone who is focused on personal growth and meaningful work, often reflecting on his search for purpose. He mentions feeling isolated and uncertain, which suggests he might not be someone who takes a lot of time to reason things out carefully. Instead, he seems to trust his instincts and desires to find his path, even if it involves some uncertainty. This aligns more with someone who would choose 1.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Shane has experienced significant stress and uncertainty, particularly with his job search and personal life. He has expressed feelings of frustration, anxiety, and depression, which suggest that he may struggle to reason well under pressure. The interview highlights his current struggles and the emotional toll of his situation, indicating that he is likely to identify with the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_6": "Based on Shane's description and the interview, he does not seem to be someone who excels in logical reasoning. He has been focusing on social work and personal development rather than fields that require extensive logical analysis. Additionally, Shane mentions that he is still job searching and trying to find his footing, indicating that he is not in a profession that heavily relies on logical reasoning. Therefore, it is more likely that Shane would choose a lower number on this scale.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Shane seems to be a reflective and thoughtful individual who values personal growth and meaningful work. While he doesn't explicitly mention having a logical mind, his focus on career choices and his willingness to engage in self-reflection suggests he is capable of logical thinking. However, he also emphasizes the importance of empathy and personal connections, which might indicate a more holistic approach rather than a purely logical one.",
            "REI_8": "Based on the interview, Shane appears to value careful thought and reflection, especially in his career pursuits. He describes himself as someone who has been contemplating his future and making decisions based on thoughtful considerations, such as shadowing professionals and choosing a career path. This suggests he values and engages in careful thinking, which aligns more with the higher end of the scale.",
            "REI_9": "Based on the interview, Shane seems to value logical thinking and has a background in sociology, suggesting he appreciates analytical approaches to understanding and solving problems. However, he also mentions feeling stressed and uncertain, which might temporarily impact his ability to use logic effectively. Given his intellectual leanings and the structured nature of his academic and professional pursuits, it is reasonable to assume that he finds logic useful, even if he currently faces some challenges.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Shane often reflects on his decisions and explains his motivations, such as choosing a career in social work after shadowing professionals. This suggests he values clear explanations and is capable of articulating his reasons. However, Shane also mentions feeling lost and uncertain at times, which indicates he may not always have clear reasons for his decisions, especially during his current job search. Given these factors, Shane is more likely to lean towards a moderate score, acknowledging his ability to provide clear reasons while recognizing occasional uncertainty."

He mentions that he hasn't maintained close friendships from college and hasn't been able to establish new ones since moving to Portland. He also mentions feeling like he is 'treading water' and not fully integrated into his community. These details suggest that Shane is not very outgoing or socially engaged, which aligns with being more reserved.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Shane's interview highlights a sense of isolation, difficulty forming close relationships, and a lack of strong social connections. He mentions feeling disconnected from family and friends, and while he values personal growth and meaningful work, he does not express a strong sense of trust in others. His struggles with job searching and lack of support networks suggest a more guarded or skeptical outlook.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Shane has described his current situation as one of uncertainty, job searching, and personal growth. While he acknowledges challenges and feelings of isolation, he also consistently expresses a desire to improve, find meaningful work, and stay positive. He is actively trying to network, apply for jobs, and reflect on his life goals, which suggests he does not see himself as lazy. His self-described determination and efforts to move forward indicate a higher self-perception of motivation.",

They have mentioned struggling with depression, anxiety, and difficulty maintaining a stable routine.

His focus has been on social work, personal growth, and job searching, with no mention of hobbies or interests related to art. He appears to be more oriented toward practical and social goals rather than creative or artistic pursuits.",
            "BFI-10_6": "The participant has described feeling isolated and struggling to build close relationships, both in his personal life and within his community. He mentions not having close friends, drifting apart from college friends, and not being very involved with his family. While he is open to reconnecting and building new connections, he has not yet done so, and his current environment (Old Town Portland) has not led to meaningful social integration. This suggests a lower level of self-perceived sociability.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Shane O'Donnell describes himself as someone who is reflective, values personal growth, and is driven by a desire to make a difference in people's lives. He also mentions feeling isolated and struggling with self-doubt, but he does not express a tendency to criticize or find fault with others. In fact, his focus on social work and helping others suggests a more empathetic and understanding disposition.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Shane has described his current situation as one of uncertainty, with a lack of consistent routine and a focus on job searching. He has mentioned struggling with motivation and feeling like he is 'treading water.' While he values meaningful work and has a clear career path in mind, he has not yet found a stable job or demonstrated consistent follow-through in his job search. This suggests he may not yet see himself as someone who consistently does a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Throughout the interview, Shane expressed feelings of frustration, anxiety, and uncertainty about his job search, financial stability, and social connections. He mentioned struggling with depression and anxiety, particularly when job applications didn’t yield results. These emotional struggles suggest that he does experience nervousness and stress in uncertain situations, which aligns more with the lower end of the range.",
            "BFI-10_10": "The participant describes himself as someone who values personal growth, meaningful work, and has a clear sense of purpose, but there is no explicit mention of creativity, imagination, or engagement with abstract or artistic ideas.

He does not emphasize logical or systematic thinking in his narrative, instead focusing on personal experiences and emotional struggles. This suggests he may not identify as a very analytical thinker.",
            "REI_4": "Shane has shown throughout the interview that he reflects on his life, decisions, and challenges, often weighing different paths and considering their impacts. He has described moments of contemplation, such as during his sophomore year when he considered various career paths, and he has also reflected on his mental health and the need for better coping strategies. This suggests he does engage in careful reasoning, even if he sometimes feels uncertain or overwhelmed.",
            "REI_5": "Shane has described feeling overwhelmed by the uncertainty of his job search, struggling with stress, and having inconsistent routines. He has also mentioned feelings of frustration, anxiety, and difficulty maintaining motivation, which suggest that he may not reason well under pressure. These emotional and mental challenges align with a higher score on this statement.",
            "REI_6": "Shane describes himself as someone who values personal growth and meaningful work, and he reflects on his life with introspection and emotional awareness. While he is thoughtful and analytical in some ways (e.g., reflecting on his career path and mental health), he also emphasizes uncertainty, emotional struggles, and the importance of relationships.

            "REI_7": "Shane's interview highlights a focus on personal growth, emotional reflection, and a desire to make a difference in people's lives. While he shows some analytical thinking in his job search and self-reflection, there is no strong emphasis on logical reasoning as a defining trait. His narrative is more introspective and emotionally driven, suggesting he may not strongly identify with having a 'logical mind' as a core attribute.",

While he reflects on his life and decisions, he also mentions feeling isolated and struggling to maintain a stable routine.

            "REI_9": "Shane mentions feeling uncertain and struggling with job searching, often expressing frustration and a sense of being overwhelmed. He also discusses moments of self-reflection and decision-making, but these are framed more as introspective or emotional processes rather than logical ones.

He has mentioned struggling to build connections and has not described feeling particularly trusting of others.

            "BFI-10_4": "Throughout the interview, Shane expressed significant stress related to unemployment, financial instability, and a lack of social connections. He mentioned feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and struggling with depression and back pain, all of which indicate a difficulty in handling stress. While he has tried mindfulness and meditation, he also admitted it's been hard to find a stable routine or feel in control of his situation. This suggests he would not rate himself highly on stress management.",

His focus has been on social work, job searching, and personal growth, with no indication of engagement with art, music, or creative hobbies.

He mentions not having close friends from college, difficulty connecting with neighbors, and a lack of strong social networks.

He reflects on his own struggles with unemployment, mental health, and social isolation, but does not express a tendency to judge or find fault with others. In fact, he seems to be more self-critical than critical of others, and his narrative is centered around seeking support and understanding rather than pointing out the faults of others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Shane has expressed feelings of uncertainty and frustration about his job search and current lack of stable employment. He has described his routine as inconsistent and has struggled to maintain focus or structure.

While he doesn't explicitly mention imagination, his introspective nature, his desire to make a difference, and his reflections on his life journey suggest a degree of creativity and self-reflection. However, he also describes feeling isolated and struggling with routine, which may indicate a more grounded, practical mindset. This suggests a middle ground rather than a high score on imagination."

            "BES-A_4": "Shane describes feeling isolated, struggling with job searching, and experiencing anxiety and depression. He also mentions difficulty forming close relationships and a lack of strong social connections.

            "BES-A_5": "Shane describes himself as someone who values personal growth and meaningful work, and he has a strong interest in social work, which inherently requires empathy and understanding of others' feelings. However, he also mentions feeling isolated and struggling to build close relationships, which suggests he may not be as naturally attuned to others' emotions as someone who scores higher on this scale. His introspective nature and focus on self-reliance may also suggest a more reserved or less intuitive approach to reading others' emotions.",
            "BES-A_6": "Shane has described feeling isolated and struggling to build connections, which suggests he may not be highly influenced by the cheerfulness of others.

He also mentioned difficulty reconnecting with old friends and feeling like he hasn't built a strong social network. This suggests he may not have the regular, close interactions needed to become adept at reading his friends' emotions, which would support a lower score."

He also mentions being at a crossroads in his life and struggling with job searching. While he is reflective and introspective, there is no explicit mention of him being particularly strong in logical reasoning or analytical thinking. Instead, his narrative emphasizes emotional and social engagement, suggesting he may not see himself as highly logical.",
            "REI_7": "Shane describes himself as someone who values personal growth, meaningful work, and relationships. He reflects on his life with emotional depth and often discusses feelings of uncertainty, isolation, and the need for support. While he shows some analytical thinking in his job search and planning, his narrative is more introspective and emotionally driven than strictly logical. This suggests he is more likely to identify with the lower end of the range.",

These statements suggest a level of caution or hesitation in trusting others, possibly due to past experiences or current feelings of uncertainty. While he values relationships, the interview suggests he hasn't formed many meaningful ones recently, which may indicate a lower level of trust in others.",

He mentions not having many close friends, feeling disconnected from his family, and struggling to integrate into his neighborhood.
