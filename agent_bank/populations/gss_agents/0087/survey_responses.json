However, she has also mentioned strategies to manage her anxiety, such as talking to friends and colleagues, practicing deep breathing and meditation, and attending a virtual support group.

However, she has also mentioned implementing coping strategies like journaling, meditation, and attending support groups. These actions suggest that while the pressure is high, she is working to manage it.
