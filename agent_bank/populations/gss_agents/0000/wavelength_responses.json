However, it also implies a pattern of unfortunate events, which can be seen as a form of causality in the sense that there are underlying reasons for these occurrences, such as human error or environmental factors. Given that Murphy's Law is more about the unpredictability of negative outcomes rather than the absence of causality, I would place it slightly towards the randomness side but not completely there."

Many horror films, especially those that rely heavily on jump scares or cheap thrills, can still be quite scary. However, there are also horror movies that might not be as frightening but instead focus on creating a more atmospheric and psychological scare, which can still be engaging.

          "raw_response": "Considering my background and experiences, I've always had a sense of wanderlust, but I also value the comfort and familiarity of home. 'Candle Light at New City' evokes a bittersweet feeling of being in a new place while still holding onto memories of home. The candle light might symbolize the warmth and comfort of a new environment, but also the longing for the past. Given this, I would place the marker slightly towards the middle, acknowledging both the allure of the new and the pull of the old."

          "raw_response": "I would place 'Avatar 2' around the middle of the spectrum, closer to 50. The movie 'Avatar 2' is a highly anticipated sequel that many fans are eager to see. While it's a significant release, it doesn't necessarily imply a fear of missing out as much as it might for a smaller event or experience. The movie is a once-in-a-lifetime event for many, but it's not something that would cause a significant fear of missing out for me personally. I value my time and well-being, so I might choose to sit this one out if it conflicts with other important plans or if I need a break from constant excitement and anticipation."

          "raw_response": "Diet Coke is a carbonated beverage that is designed to have a distinct taste, particularly a sweet and slightly artificial flavor due to its sugar-free composition. While it may not be as zesty as some other flavored drinks, it does have a noticeable taste. Therefore, placing Diet Coke somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, I would say it leans more towards the zesty side, but not by a significant margin. It's not bland, but it's not considered particularly zesty either. Given these considerations, I would place the marker at 40, indicating that Diet Coke is perceived as having a moderate level of flavor that is neither extremely zesty nor bland."
