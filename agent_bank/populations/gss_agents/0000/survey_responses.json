However, she also mentions that she can feel overwhelmed at times, indicating that she does experience nervousness, albeit not constantly. Given her awareness and ability to manage her emotions, a score of 3 seems most appropriate, but leaning towards 2 or 1 might be slightly more accurate given her occasional stress and her ability to handle it.",

            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Gabriela Johnson has faced various challenges and pressures, such as balancing work, family, and personal commitments, and dealing with the uncertainties brought by the pandemic. However, she has shown resilience and has developed coping mechanisms, like mindfulness and seeking support from friends and family. This suggests she is capable of handling some level of pressure. Given her ability to manage these challenges and her commitment to her work, a score of 3 seems most appropriate. However, since the statement is about not reasoning well under pressure, and considering she has shown some capacity to handle stress, a 2 might be a slightly more accurate reflection of her ability to reason under pressure, albeit not well.",
            "REI_6": "Given Gabriela's background and current professional role, she seems to value community service and social justice, which suggests a more empathetic and interpersonal approach to problem-solving rather than a purely logical one. However, her education and work in social work involve analyzing and addressing social issues, which requires some level of logical reasoning. Given this balance, it's reasonable to assume she might lean slightly towards the middle of the scale, acknowledging her logical abilities but not overestimating them.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Gabriela seems to have a strong inclination towards social work and community service, which suggests she values empathy and emotional intelligence. While she does engage in logical thinking, particularly in her work and advocacy, there doesn't seem to be a strong emphasis on her viewing herself as someone who primarily relies on logical reasoning. Her focus on community and social issues indicates a more holistic and empathetic approach to problem-solving rather than a strictly logical one.",
            "REI_8": "Based on Gabriela's responses, she seems to value thoroughness and reflection, especially in her work in social justice and community service. She mentions taking steps to address stress and mental health, which suggests she is thoughtful and careful in her approach to both personal and professional challenges. This indicates she would likely choose the higher end of the scale.",
            "REI_9": "Based on Gabriela's background and the way she describes her approach to challenges, she seems to value structured and methodical ways of thinking. Her involvement in social work and her commitment to advocacy suggest a structured approach to problem-solving. Additionally, her reflections on making conscious decisions and navigating life's crossroads indicate a preference for logical and thoughtful problem-solving methods.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Gabriela Johnson appears to have a clear understanding of her motivations and values. She reflects on her life choices and explains the reasoning behind them, indicating a tendency to think through her decisions. Additionally, her involvement in social work and community service suggests a deliberate and thoughtful approach to her actions. This aligns more with someone who would choose 5."
