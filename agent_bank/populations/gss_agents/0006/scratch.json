  "agent_profile_summary": "Francisco Garcia, a 40-year-old married father of two living in Madison, Wisconsin, grew up in a modest household where his parents, both high school graduates, worked hard to provide for their family. A defining moment in his life came during his senior year of high school when he chose to apply for a full-ride scholarship, a decision that transformed his family’s future and set him on a path to graduate education and a career in tech consulting. Today, Francisco balances his role as a project manager with his commitment to family and community, volunteering at a local community center and staying actively involved in his neighborhood. His life is shaped by a deep sense of gratitude and a belief in the power of support systems, which influences how he approaches challenges, values relationships, and remains dedicated to giving back to those around him."
