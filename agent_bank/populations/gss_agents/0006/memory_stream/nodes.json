    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nFrancisco Garcia: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Guatemala but grew up in Madison, Wisconsin. My parents, both high school graduates, moved here when they were in their early twenties. They came for better job opportunities and to give us a chance at a better life. I remember my childhood as being quite modest; we lived in a small apartment on Elmwood Avenue, which is now a quiet street, but back then, it felt like the heart of our community. My parents worked hard, mostly doing manual labor jobs, which kept us just above the poverty line. Despite the challenges, they always emphasized the importance of education.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nFrancisco Garcia: One such moment came during my senior year of high school. I had the opportunity to apply for a scholarship program that offered a full ride to a university. My parents were excited for me, but they also worried about the financial strain of sending their only child to college. After much discussion, I decided to take the risk and apply. I worked extra hard on my application, emphasizing my academic achievements and my commitment to community service. It was a long shot, but I believed in myself and the support of my community. I got accepted, and that decision changed everything for our family. We were able to save enough money to cover the initial costs, and my parents were proud of the choice I made. That scholarship became the foundation of my future, allowing me to pursue higher education and eventually leading to my current career.\n\n",

I knew that my parents' sacrifices meant everything to them, and I wanted to honor that by giving us a brighter future. But it also felt like fate had brought me to that point, guiding me towards a path that I never knew existed until I took the leap. Looking back, I can see how that decision set the stage for my entire adult life.\n\n",

Additionally, community programs and scholarships from various foundations were crucial in making my college dream a reality. Their support not only eased the financial burden but also instilled in me a sense of gratitude and responsibility to give back.\n\n",

They have a variety of subjects, including math, science, language arts, and social studies. In the afternoon, they usually have a short break for lunch and then return to class. After school, they join a few after-school clubs, such as the chess club and the robotics team. These activities help them develop critical thinking and teamwork skills.

Initially, the pandemic brought a lot of uncertainty and worry, but as we've adapted to the new normal, the stress has somewhat diminished. I've started using mindfulness techniques and journaling as coping mechanisms, which have helped me manage my anxiety. I also make sure to carve out time for relaxation, whether it's reading a book, taking a short walk, or just sitting quietly with my thoughts. It's important to find those moments of peace amidst the chaos.\n\n",

Our biggest expenses are typically housing, groceries, and childcare. Rent for our home in the Eastside neighborhood is a bit steep, but we manage with the help of a roommate. Groceries are a constant, especially since we're feeding four people now. Childcare costs can be high, but we're lucky to have a good provider nearby. Other than that, we try to save for emergencies and future goals, like our children's education. It's a tightrope, but we're getting by.\n\n",

Housing, including rent and utilities, took up about half of that, followed by groceries and childcare. We try to keep entertainment and discretionary spending to a minimum, focusing instead on essentials and savings.

During the colder months, heating costs were higher, which added a significant expense. Spring and summer brought some relief, but we had to factor in the cost of air conditioning. School-related expenses, like supplies and field trips, spiked during the academic year.

    "content": "Completing this interview and recounting my life story has been both challenging and rewarding. It allowed me to reflect on the journey that has brought me to where I am today, from my modest beginnings in Madison, Wisconsin, to the pivotal decisions that shaped my path, and finally, to the present day where I am a husband, father, and professional. Each chapter of my life has been intricately woven with the support and opportunities provided by my community, family, and the organizations that have stood by me. The challenges, such as the back pain, the transition to homeschooling, and the financial strains, have tested my resilience, but they have also strengthened my resolve to continue making a positive impact in the lives of others. Through this process, I have gained a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of my life and the importance of gratitude, giving back, and maintaining strong, supportive relationships. This interview serves as a reminder that every moment, no matter how big or small, contributes to the tapestry of our lives, and it is the collective effort of those around us that makes it all possible.",
