            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Jacob seems to have a balanced view of himself. He describes himself as a software engineer, which involves a lot of logical thinking, but he also acknowledges the fast-paced and challenging nature of his work. While he doesn't explicitly state that he excels in logical thinking, his professional background suggests he is adept at it. However, he also doesn't claim to be far superior to others. Therefore, a moderate score seems most appropriate.",
            "REI_7": "Based on Jacob's background as a software engineer, he likely engages in complex problem-solving and analytical tasks on a regular basis. His work involves designing and developing software solutions, which requires strong logical thinking.
