  "agent_profile_summary": "Sari Putri, a 43-year-old policy analyst in Ann Arbor, Michigan, grew up in Indonesia before moving to the U.S. at 16, where she was raised in a Muslim household that emphasized education and community service. A defining moment came during her high school years when she joined a volunteer program focused on immigrant rights, which led her to pursue a career in public policy and international relations. Now, she works full-time at a nonprofit advocating for human rights, balancing her professional commitments with raising her 12-year-old daughter, Maya, and maintaining an active role in her diverse neighborhood. Her life is shaped by a steady commitment to social justice, a deep sense of community, and the ongoing challenge of balancing her advocacy work with family life, all of which inform her thoughtful, grounded approach to both her personal and professional relationships."
