            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Sari Putri seems to be a person who values community and actively engages in social and community service. She mentions participating in volunteer work, attending community events, and maintaining a supportive network of friends and colleagues. This suggests she is more outgoing and sociable rather than reserved.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Sari appears to be someone who values community and support. She mentions the importance of trust in her relationships, especially with her family and community. She also describes how the support from her community and colleagues helps her navigate challenges, indicating a willingness to trust others. Therefore, it is more likely that Sari would choose a higher number on the trust scale.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Sari's description, she appears to be highly motivated and proactive in her work as a policy analyst and in her community service. She emphasizes the importance of education, community service, and advocacy, indicating a strong drive to make a positive impact. Additionally, she mentions the importance of self-care and mindfulness, suggesting she values productivity and well-being. Given these details, it seems unlikely that Sari would see herself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on Sari's responses, particularly her mention of periods of anxiety and stress, especially when the workload at her job becomes overwhelming, it's clear that she experiences stress. However, she has also taken steps to manage her stress, such as mindfulness practices and communicating openly with her daughter. This suggests she is not entirely unphased by stress, but also not constantly overwhelmed. Therefore, a score closer to 3 would be more appropriate, but considering the slightly higher end of the spectrum given her ability to manage stress, a 4 seems more fitting.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Sari Putri seems to be a person who values community service and social justice, and she has a daughter who is involved in various activities. While Sari does not explicitly mention artistic interests, her involvement in community service and her daughter's activities suggest a level of openness to different forms of expression and engagement. However, there is no direct indication of her having artistic interests herself. Given the information provided, it's reasonable to assume that she might have some artistic interests, but not many, which aligns more closely with a score closer to 1 than to 5.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on Sari's description, she mentions participating in community service, working in a nonprofit organization focused on social justice, and engaging in various activities with her daughter and community.

            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the information provided in the interview, Sari Putri seems to be someone who values community service and social justice.

Her values and experiences point towards a more positive and constructive approach to interactions with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on Sari's detailed descriptions of her work as a policy analyst and her commitment to making a positive impact, it's clear that she values thoroughness and attention to detail. She mentions the importance of conducting thorough research, collaborating with legal experts, and engaging with community members to understand their needs and concerns. These behaviors indicate a strong desire to do a thorough job in her work. Additionally, her focus on balance and the importance of her daughter's upbringing suggests a conscientious and thorough approach to her responsibilities.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Sari seems to handle stress relatively well. She mentions dealing with periods of anxiety due to workloads and responsibilities, but she also describes using strategies like mindfulness and meditation to manage these feelings. Her overall tone suggests a balanced approach to stress rather than frequent or intense nervousness.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Sari Putri seems to be someone who values practical and meaningful work, such as policy analysis and community service. She has a strong sense of purpose and values the tangible impact of her work, which suggests she might not see herself as someone who engages in purely imaginative scenarios. However, given her involvement in community service and advocacy, she might still have moments of creative thinking and storytelling related to her work and activism. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems fitting, but leaning towards a slightly lower end of the scale due to her preference for practical and goal-oriented activities."
