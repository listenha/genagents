            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Sari Putri describes herself as someone who values community service and engagement, indicating a preference for social interaction and helping others. She also mentions being involved in various activities and discussions, suggesting she is not someone who prefers solitude. Therefore, she is more likely to disagree with the statement that she is reserved.",

She has a supportive network of friends, colleagues, and community members who provide her with the necessary support. Additionally, her commitment to social justice and community service indicates that she trusts others to work towards similar goals. Therefore, it is likely that she would rate herself closer to 5 on the scale.",

            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Sari described herself as dealing with periods of anxiety and stress, particularly when her workload becomes overwhelming. However, she also mentioned that she is learning to manage these feelings and has strategies like meditation to help her cope. This suggests she is not someone who constantly struggles with stress, but also is not entirely relaxed all the time. Given her commitment to self-care and her recognition of the importance of managing stress, it's likely she would rate herself closer to the middle of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the information provided in the interview, Sari Putri seems to have a strong connection with her values and community service, and she emphasizes her involvement in community service and advocacy work. While she doesn't mention having many artistic interests, the interview does not suggest that she lacks interest in art entirely.

            "BFI-10_8": "Based on the interview, Sari Putri appears to be someone who places a high value on thoroughness and quality in her work. She is described as a policy analyst at a nonprofit organization, which often requires careful research and attention to detail. Additionally, her involvement in community service and advocacy work suggests that she values making a positive impact through her thorough and thoughtful actions.

            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Sari has described experiencing periods of anxiety and stress, particularly when her workload becomes overwhelming. However, she has also taken steps to manage these feelings, such as practicing mindfulness and setting boundaries. While Sari does experience anxiety, it doesn't seem to be a constant or overwhelming presence in her life. Therefore, she is more likely to fall towards the lower end of the spectrum.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Sari Putri does not seem to be someone who would describe herself as highly imaginative. While she engages in community service, advocates for social justice, and seems to value education, there is no indication that she is particularly creative or uses her imagination extensively in her daily life. Her responses indicate a more pragmatic and focused approach to her work and family life."
