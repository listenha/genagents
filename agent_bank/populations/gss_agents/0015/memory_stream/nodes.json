Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nSari Putri: I was born in Indonesia but moved to the United States when I was 16, so I have a bit of a bicultural background. My family was Muslim, and both my parents were very supportive of my education. My father worked hard to get his bachelor's degree, while my mother earned her associate degree. They instilled in me the importance of education and community service. I grew up in a household with two parents, which was typical of my family structure at that time.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nSari Putri: One such crossroads occurred during my high school years. I had always been interested in social justice and community service, but it wasn't until I joined a volunteer program in my senior year that I realized how much impact I could have. Through this program, I got involved in advocacy work for immigrant rights, which aligned perfectly with my values and passions. It was a pivotal moment because it solidified my commitment to using my education and skills to make a positive change in society. This experience also led me to apply to colleges with strong programs in public policy and international relations, ultimately shaping my future career path.\n\n",

I didn't necessarily set out to become an activist or a policy maker, but the work I did in that program ignited a passion within me. I knew I wanted to do more, and I felt called to use my voice and my skills to address issues that mattered to me. It was a natural progression from my childhood values and the education my parents encouraged me to pursue.\n\n",

She is incredibly bright and compassionate, much like how I remember myself back in high school. We share custody, and we both play a significant role in her life.

The pivotal moment in my high school years, when I became involved in advocacy work for immigrant rights, not only solidified my commitment to making a positive change in society but also influenced my academic and professional decisions. While the path felt natural to me, I recognize now that without the support of my parents, mentors, and the volunteer program leaders, my journey might have taken a different course. Presently, my relationship with my daughter, Maya, is a significant source of inspiration and motivation. Her brightness and compassion remind me of my own values and the importance of continuing the work I started.",

I've been more intentional about practicing mindfulness and setting aside time for relaxation. I still have those moments where the weight of the world feels heavy, but I'm learning to acknowledge them and then take steps to manage them. For example, I've started meditating every morning before work, and it's made a noticeable difference in how I approach my day. I've also been more vocal about my feelings with Maya, which has helped us both. She understands that it's okay to express our emotions and that we can support each other through tough times.\n\n",

Our rent is pretty reasonable given the neighborhood, but it still takes up a significant portion of our budget. Groceries are another big one, especially since we try to buy organic and healthy options. Maya's school fees and extracurricular activities also add up, but we manage with the help of a few scholarships and community grants.

In the colder months, heating costs were higher, which added to our overall expenses. During the summer, when the weather was warmer, we spent more on air conditioning and electricity. We also had a few unexpected expenses, like a car repair that required a trip to the mechanic.

Of course, there are days when the demands feel overwhelming, but I remind myself of the impact we're making and the importance of our work.
