            "REI_10": "Based on Kira's reflection during the interview, she mentions that her path was often a series of small steps rather than grand, life-changing decisions. This suggests that she may not always have clear, explainable reasons for her decisions, as she describes them as more organic and driven by circumstances rather than a well-thought-out process.

            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Kira seems to be a person who values her community and enjoys social interactions, but also emphasizes the importance of balance and taking time to relax and recharge. She mentions activities like meditation, reading, and gardening, which suggest she appreciates quiet and introspective moments. However, she also maintains close relationships and is involved in community activities, indicating she is not completely reserved. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that she would choose a number closer to 3, reflecting a moderate level of reservedness.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Kira appears to be someone who has faced significant challenges in her life, including a complex family background and financial hardships. Despite these challenges, she has maintained a positive outlook and has been proactive in seeking support and making positive changes. Her willingness to give back to her community and her emphasis on support from friends and family suggest a generally trusting nature.

            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Kira has faced significant stress related to anxiety and work demands. She has been working on coping strategies like meditation and setting aside time for hobbies, which suggests she is actively managing her stress. However, she mentions that her stress levels can fluctuate and that recent challenges at home have caused her stress levels to rise. This indicates that while she is working on managing her stress, she still experiences it at times. Given her awareness and efforts to manage stress, but the presence of occasional fluctuations, a score of 3 seems most fitting.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on Kira's responses, she seems to value her community and personal growth, but there's no mention of her having many artistic interests. She mentions hobbies like reading and gardening, which are more about relaxation and stress relief rather than artistic engagement.

            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Kira has described facing challenges such as anxiety over the past year and having to work on managing it through therapy and mindfulness practices. This indicates that she experiences nervousness, but it is not her constant state. She has shown resilience and a proactive approach to dealing with anxiety, suggesting that while she does feel nervous, it is not a defining characteristic of her personality.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Kira seems grounded in her real-life experiences and practical approach to life. She focuses on her career, community involvement, and personal growth, which suggests a more pragmatic outlook rather than a highly imaginative one.
