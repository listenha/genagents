            "REI_10": "Based on Kira's reflection during the interview, she mentions that her path was often a series of small steps rather than grand, life-changing decisions. This suggests that she may not always have clear, explainable reasons for her decisions, as she describes them as more organic and driven by circumstances rather than a well-thought-out process.

She talks about the small steps and everyday choices that led to her current situation, indicating that she considers the reasons behind her decisions.
