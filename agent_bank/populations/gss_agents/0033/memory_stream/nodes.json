    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nKira Mason: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a Somali father and an Ethiopian mother. My parents were both refugees who met in the United States and had me when they were in their early twenties. Growing up, my family structure was quite complex due to my parents' divorce when I was six years old. They lived separately but managed to co-parent as best they could. My mom worked at a local grocery store to support us, while my dad was mostly absent but still played a role in my life through occasional visits and financial contributions. We lived in a modest apartment in the city, and our income was always on the lower side.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nKira Mason: One such moment came during my high school years. I was facing a decision about whether to continue my education or take a job to help support my family. My mom encouraged me to stay in school, saying that education was our best chance for a better future. Despite my initial hesitation, I decided to follow her advice and applied to community college. This decision proved to be a turning point; it not only helped me gain skills and knowledge but also gave me a sense of purpose and direction. I eventually transferred to a four-year university and graduated with a degree in business administration.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nKira Mason: I think it just happened, really. It wasn't a grand, life-changing decision, but more of a series of small steps that led me to where I am now. My mom's encouragement was a catalyst, but the path itself was paved with everyday choices and circumstances. I remember the day I decided to stay in school\u2014I felt a mix of fear and excitement. Fear because I didn't know how I would manage financially, and excitement because I knew education was the key to breaking the cycle of poverty my family had experienced. I worked part-time jobs, applied for scholarships, and sought out mentors who believed in me. Each step was challenging, but they all added up to this point where I'm working full-time and contributing to my community.\n\n",

There were definitely times when I needed extra support.

Their mentorship program was instrumental in helping me navigate the application process. Additionally, I received support from a community college advisor who helped me secure a part-time job that allowed me to work while studying. These resources were crucial in making my decision to stay in school a reality.\n\n",

To save money, I've started cooking more meals at home and using public transportation instead of driving.
