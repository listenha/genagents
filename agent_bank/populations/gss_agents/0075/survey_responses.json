            "BFI-10_1": "Based on Miguel's interview, he describes himself as slightly liberal and independent, which suggests he might value his personal space and comfort in certain social situations. His reflections on balancing work and family life indicate that he values privacy and quality time with his family, which aligns more closely with someone who might be reserved.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Miguel appears to be someone who values community and support from those around him. His willingness to reach out to his online community for support and encouragement suggests he is open and trusting of others. Additionally, his emphasis on the importance of relationships, especially with his family and friends, indicates a general trust in people. He does not mention any significant mistrust or caution in his interactions, which supports a more trusting nature.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Miguel's description of himself, he seems to be quite balanced and responsible. He describes himself as slightly liberal politically and independent but close to Democrats, which suggests he values hard work and dedication. His emphasis on balancing work and family, as well as his commitment to self-care and his children's education, indicates he sees himself as someone who takes initiative and responsibilities seriously. Therefore, it's unlikely he would consider himself lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Miguel appears to handle stress reasonably well. He describes his routine and coping mechanisms, such as meditation and journaling, which indicate a certain level of relaxation and stress management. Additionally, he mentions that reaching out to his community during tough times is helpful, suggesting he is not overly stressed. However, he does acknowledge some stress during busy periods, indicating he is not perfectly relaxed all the time. Therefore, a score of 4 seems most fitting, but since the options are 1-5, a 5 better captures his overall ability to handle stress compared to a 4.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview transcript, Miguel appears to value education and community, but there is no mention of him having a particular affinity for artistic pursuits. He talks about his work and family life, and while he does mention homeschooling his children, there's no indication that he himself engages in artistic activities. Given his focus on practical and professional matters, it's more likely that he sees himself as someone with few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Miguel describes himself as having a close-knit community and a supportive network of friends and family. He mentions engaging in activities like family game nights and movie nights, which suggest he values social connections. However, he also talks about using meditation and journaling to manage stress, which could indicate a need for some alone time. Given his family-oriented and community-involved nature, but also his mention of needing personal space, a middle-ground response seems fitting. However, his overall emphasis on social support and community suggests he leans more towards being sociable.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Miguel seems to be a balanced and caring person who values community and family. He has described himself as slightly liberal and independent, close to democrat, indicating a more open-minded and tolerant worldview. He also mentioned that his mother's encouragement and support played a significant role in his life, which suggests that he is open to advice and tends to be understanding. Therefore, it's unlikely that Miguel sees himself as someone who constantly finds fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on Miguel's responses, he seems to value quality and consistency in his work. He described his role as a business analyst where he collaborates with cross-functional teams to understand business needs and translate them into technical solutions. This suggests that he is detail-oriented and takes his work seriously. Additionally, he mentioned that his job involves a lot of meetings and client interactions, indicating that he is dedicated to ensuring that these interactions are productive and thorough. Given these details, it is reasonable to predict that Miguel sees himself as someone who does a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Miguel appears to be a practical and balanced individual who manages to maintain a good sense of composure, especially considering the various challenges he faces in his life, such as work, family, and health. He describes coping strategies and support systems that suggest he is able to handle stress reasonably well. However, given that he does mention experiencing some stress and challenges, it is reasonable to assume that he might be on the higher end of the scale, but not necessarily at the extreme.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview transcript, Miguel appears to be a pragmatic and detail-oriented person who focuses on practical matters like work, family, and health. He describes himself as slightly liberal politically and values education and community.

This suggests he values logical reasoning in his professional context. However, he also mentioned that his work can be fast-paced and demanding, indicating that he recognizes his limitations and the importance of teamwork.

This suggests he is involved in problem-solving tasks, which indicates he likely has some skills in dealing with complex problems. However, he also mentions that his work can be demanding and sometimes requires late nights and weekends, suggesting he might find certain aspects of problem-solving challenging. Given his background and the nature of his job, it seems more likely that he would rate himself slightly higher than 1 but not extremely high, such as 5.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview transcript, Miguel appears to be a pragmatic and community-oriented individual who values balance and connection. While he mentions that his job involves problem-solving and collaboration, he does not specifically highlight exceptional skills in logical analysis. His description of balancing work and family life suggests a focus on practical solutions rather than purely analytical ones. Therefore, it seems more likely that he would place himself somewhere in the middle of the scale, acknowledging that he is not particularly skilled in logical analysis but not completely unskilled either.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Miguel describes himself as a business analyst and someone who deals with fast-paced environments and complex projects. These roles often require analytical thinking. Additionally, he mentions that his job involves a lot of meetings, client interactions, and translating business needs into technical solutions, which suggests a level of analytical thinking. Therefore, it is unlikely that Miguel would strongly agree with the statement that he is not a very analytical thinker.",
            "REI_4": "Based on the interview, Miguel seems to value practical and strategic thinking in his work and family life, especially when it comes to balancing professional and personal responsibilities. However, he also mentions that he tries to find a balance and supports his family through thoughtful actions. This suggests he is not entirely impulsive, but the statement about reasoning things out carefully not being one of his strong points indicates he does rely more on quick decisions and intuition. Given his pragmatic nature and the need to manage both work and family, it's reasonable to assume he leans more towards quick decision-making in some contexts.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Miguel describes himself as someone who tries to maintain a balanced life and finds various strategies to manage stress and cope with challenges. He mentions using mindfulness and deep breathing exercises, which suggests he is capable of reasoning well under pressure. Additionally, he talks about the importance of support from his family and community, indicating he has a network that helps him stay grounded. Therefore, it seems unlikely that he would rate himself as someone who struggles with reasoning under pressure.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Miguel seems to be someone who values and appreciates logical thinking, as evidenced by his work as a business analyst and his commitment to problem-solving. However, he also mentions the importance of community and support, suggesting he might not consider himself overwhelmingly superior in logical reasoning compared to others. Given his balanced approach to life and work, a score of 3 seems most fitting, but since the options are limited, 4 would be a reasonable choice to indicate he is better than average but not overwhelmingly so.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Miguel is described as a business analyst who works in a fast-paced environment involving meetings, client interactions, and translating business needs into technical solutions. This suggests he has a logical and analytical mind, which aligns more closely with the higher end of the scale. Additionally, his professional success and the description of his work as 'rewarding' and 'challenging' indicate he is capable of logical thinking.",
            "REI_8": "Based on the interview, Miguel seems to be someone who values a balanced approach to life. While he appreciates the importance of thoughtful decision-making, the interview also shows that he is capable of handling stress and making quick decisions, such as moving to a new city for work. He also mentions using coping strategies like meditation and journaling to manage stress, indicating a reflective and thoughtful nature. However, his willingness to take on challenges and adapt to new situations suggests he is not overly cautious about every decision.",
            "REI_9": "Based on the interview, Miguel appears to have a practical and structured approach to life. He values the support of his family and community, and he appreciates the benefits of a structured educational environment. Given his profession as a business analyst and his emphasis on problem-solving and strategic thinking, it's reasonable to assume that he would rate his ability to use logic highly.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Miguel seems to have a balanced view of his decision-making process. He acknowledges that his decisions are often influenced by both practical considerations and the support of those around him, such as his mother's encouragement. This suggests that while he may not always have clear, explainable reasons for his decisions, he does have a tendency to think through them carefully. However, the complexity of his life, including balancing work, family, and health, indicates that his decisions are not always straightforward. Therefore, a score of 3 seems most appropriate."
