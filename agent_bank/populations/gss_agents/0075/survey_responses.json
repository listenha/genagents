            "BFI-10_1": "Based on Miguel's interview, he describes himself as slightly liberal and independent, which suggests he might value his personal space and comfort in certain social situations. His reflections on balancing work and family life indicate that he values privacy and quality time with his family, which aligns more closely with someone who might be reserved.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Miguel appears to be someone who values community and support from those around him. His willingness to reach out to his online community for support and encouragement suggests he is open and trusting of others. Additionally, his emphasis on the importance of relationships, especially with his family and friends, indicates a general trust in people. He does not mention any significant mistrust or caution in his interactions, which supports a more trusting nature.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Miguel's description of himself, he seems to be quite balanced and responsible. He describes himself as slightly liberal politically and independent but close to Democrats, which suggests he values hard work and dedication. His emphasis on balancing work and family, as well as his commitment to self-care and his children's education, indicates he sees himself as someone who takes initiative and responsibilities seriously. Therefore, it's unlikely he would consider himself lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Miguel appears to handle stress reasonably well. He describes his routine and coping mechanisms, such as meditation and journaling, which indicate a certain level of relaxation and stress management. Additionally, he mentions that reaching out to his community during tough times is helpful, suggesting he is not overly stressed. However, he does acknowledge some stress during busy periods, indicating he is not perfectly relaxed all the time. Therefore, a score of 4 seems most fitting, but since the options are 1-5, a 5 better captures his overall ability to handle stress compared to a 4.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview transcript, Miguel appears to value education and community, but there is no mention of him having a particular affinity for artistic pursuits. He talks about his work and family life, and while he does mention homeschooling his children, there's no indication that he himself engages in artistic activities. Given his focus on practical and professional matters, it's more likely that he sees himself as someone with few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Miguel describes himself as having a close-knit community and a supportive network of friends and family. He mentions engaging in activities like family game nights and movie nights, which suggest he values social connections. However, he also talks about using meditation and journaling to manage stress, which could indicate a need for some alone time. Given his family-oriented and community-involved nature, but also his mention of needing personal space, a middle-ground response seems fitting. However, his overall emphasis on social support and community suggests he leans more towards being sociable.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Miguel seems to be a balanced and caring person who values community and family. He has described himself as slightly liberal and independent, close to democrat, indicating a more open-minded and tolerant worldview. He also mentioned that his mother's encouragement and support played a significant role in his life, which suggests that he is open to advice and tends to be understanding. Therefore, it's unlikely that Miguel sees himself as someone who constantly finds fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on Miguel's responses, he seems to value quality and consistency in his work. He described his role as a business analyst where he collaborates with cross-functional teams to understand business needs and translate them into technical solutions. This suggests that he is detail-oriented and takes his work seriously. Additionally, he mentioned that his job involves a lot of meetings and client interactions, indicating that he is dedicated to ensuring that these interactions are productive and thorough. Given these details, it is reasonable to predict that Miguel sees himself as someone who does a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Miguel appears to be a practical and balanced individual who manages to maintain a good sense of composure, especially considering the various challenges he faces in his life, such as work, family, and health. He describes coping strategies and support systems that suggest he is able to handle stress reasonably well. However, given that he does mention experiencing some stress and challenges, it is reasonable to assume that he might be on the higher end of the scale, but not necessarily at the extreme.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview transcript, Miguel appears to be a pragmatic and detail-oriented person who focuses on practical matters like work, family, and health. He describes himself as slightly liberal politically and values education and community. While he does mention his family and community support, there are no indications that he engages in imaginative or creative activities. His descriptions suggest a preference for concrete and structured environments rather than abstract or imaginative ones."

He also shares that he uses social media to stay connected with the wider world and shares updates about his life. This suggests he is generally aware of his friends' emotional states.

He described himself as a business analyst who collaborates with cross-functional teams and translates business needs into technical solutions. This suggests he values logical reasoning in his professional context. However, he also mentioned that his work can be fast-paced and demanding, indicating that he recognizes his limitations and the importance of teamwork. Given his self-description and the support he receives from his family and community, it's reasonable to predict that he would rate himself somewhere in the middle rather than at the extreme end of the scale.",
            "REI_7": "Based on Miguel's responses, he seems to have a balanced and practical approach to life. He talks about making decisions based on a combination of factors, such as his mother's advice and his own desires, rather than strictly relying on logic.

He also mentioned that he values community and family, suggesting a more social and engaged personality. His willingness to move to a new city for work and his appreciation of the support from his mother and community indicate that he is not extremely reserved.

He mentions that he manages stress by practicing mindfulness, taking breaks, and talking to his family. This suggests that he would likely see himself as someone who handles stress well, rather than someone who struggles with it.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Miguel appears to have a relatively balanced life with a mix of professional and personal interests. He describes himself as a business analyst, which is a career that does not inherently require or promote artistic interests. However, he also mentions having close relationships with family, friends, and colleagues, suggesting a more social and possibly creative side. His decision to move to Charlotte for work and the emphasis on his family life suggest a preference for stability and routine, which aligns more with the lower end of the scale. However, his mention of friends and engaging in community activities points to some level of social and creative engagement, preventing him from fully identifying as having few artistic interests.",

            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview transcript, Miguel describes himself as having experienced stress and occasionally feeling overwhelmed, particularly during busy periods at work and managing the transition to homeschooling. However, he also mentions using various coping mechanisms like meditation and journaling, indicating he is aware of his feelings but manages them effectively. This suggests he is not someone who constantly feels nervous but does experience it periodically. Given his adaptive nature, 3 seems like a reasonable midpoint, but considering he is not overly stressed and has coping strategies, a 2 might better represent his tendency to handle nervousness well.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Miguel seems to value practicality and the real world, especially in his professional life as a business analyst. He focuses on problem-solving and translating business needs into technical solutions, which suggests a more grounded approach.
