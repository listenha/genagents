He mentions making conscious decisions and balancing his career and family life, which suggests he has problem-solving skills. However, he also talks about feeling stressed with work deadlines and the growing responsibilities of his children, which might indicate some difficulty in handling certain complex issues. Given his background and the challenges he faces, it seems he would recognize his limitations but still have some confidence in his abilities.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Carlos is described as a financial analyst who deals with data analysis and client meetings. While he mentions that his job can be demanding, he also states that he enjoys applying his skills in practical ways, indicating that he likely has some proficiency in logical analysis. However, he doesn't explicitly highlight exceptional skills in this area, suggesting he may not consider himself a master of logical analysis. Given his profession and the challenges he faces, it seems more plausible that he sees room for improvement in this area without completely dismissing his abilities.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Carlos described himself as a financial analyst who deals with data analysis and client meetings, indicating that he does engage in analytical thinking. However, he also mentioned that he finds ways to manage stress through mindfulness practices and maintains a balanced lifestyle, suggesting he might not be overly analytical in his personal life. Given his professional background and the fact that he tries to balance analytical work with other activities, a moderate score seems fitting.",
            "REI_4": "Based on the interview, Carlos seems to value community support and follows his heart in making decisions, as evidenced by his choice to pursue higher education despite his parents' initial reservations. He also mentions that he tries to find support from friends and community resources during tough times, indicating a preference for practical solutions over purely logical ones. Therefore, it's more likely that Carlos would fall towards the lower end of the scale.",

However, he mentions using coping mechanisms like yoga and setting boundaries, indicating that he is aware of his stress and is actively trying to manage it. While he acknowledges the pressure, he does not seem to struggle significantly with reasoning in high-pressure situations, as he has found ways to cope and maintain his composure.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Carlos describes himself as someone who has pursued a career in finance and has taken on the demanding role of a financial analyst. These roles require strong analytical and logical reasoning skills. Additionally, his reflective nature and the mention of using activities like yoga and setting clear boundaries suggest he values and applies logical thinking in his daily life. Given this context, it is reasonable to assume that Carlos would rate himself higher on logical reasoning compared to most people.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Carlos seems to have a balanced perspective. He is a financial analyst, which requires logical and analytical thinking, but he also values his faith and family, which are more intuitive and emotional aspects of life. His ability to balance work, family, and personal health indicates a mix of logical and emotional thinking. However, given his profession and the nature of his work, it is reasonable to assume that he leans towards logical thinking more often.",

His background in economics and his current job as a financial analyst suggest he values logic and analytical thinking.

He explains his choices to his parents and considers various factors before making significant life decisions. This indicates that he usually has clear, explainable reasons for his decisions."
