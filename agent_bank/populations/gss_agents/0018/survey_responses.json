            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Carlos describes himself as someone who has made conscious choices and has taken steps to pursue his passions, such as enrolling in university. This suggests he is likely to be reflective and possibly analytical, but the interview does not provide specific information indicating he excels in logical thinking compared to most people.
