  "agent_profile_summary": "Angela Hubbell, 44, grew up in Houston, Texas, in a stable household where education and hard work were deeply valued. After initially pursuing accounting, she switched to a business administration degree, a decision that opened new professional opportunities and shaped her career as a marketing manager. Married for ten years to John, a software engineer, and a mother to five-year-old Marcus, she balances her full-time job with homeschooling him, a shift that has deepened their bond and allowed her to instill early business concepts in him. A committed member of her Protestant church community, she finds strength and connection through faith and service, volunteering at a local food bank and mentoring junior marketers. Her life reflects a steady commitment to family, professional growth, and community, navigating the demands of work and parenting with resilience and a focus on stability."
