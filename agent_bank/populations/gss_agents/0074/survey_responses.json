            "BFI-10_1": "Based on Angela's description, she seems to value her family and community connections but also appreciates a sense of stability and order in her life. She mentions having a close-knit community in her neighborhood and valuing the support of her immediate family and extended network. This suggests that while she is sociable and supportive, she may not be the type to seek out large social gatherings or feel comfortable in overly crowded or extroverted situations. Her preference for homeschooling her son and focusing on family activities indicates a desire for more controlled and intimate interactions. Given these details, it's reasonable to infer that she would place herself somewhere in the middle to slightly towards the 'reserved' end of the spectrum.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on Angela's responses, she seems to value stability and trust within her family and community. She talks about the importance of support from her husband, friends, and community, which suggests a generally positive and trusting outlook. Additionally, she mentions the importance of faith and community, which further supports a trusting nature. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that she would lean towards the higher end of the trust scale.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Angela's interview, she describes herself as a hardworking individual who values education, has a stable job, and manages her household responsibilities effectively. She mentions prioritizing her health and setting aside time for family and community involvement, indicating a strong sense of responsibility and motivation. Therefore, it is unlikely that Angela sees herself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on Angela's reflections, she describes handling the challenges of the past year, including the transition to homeschooling her son, maintaining her job, and managing a flexible work schedule. While she acknowledges moments of stress and difficulty, she also mentions strategies to cope with stress, such as exercise, journaling, and prioritizing self-care. Her ability to adapt and find coping mechanisms suggests she is relatively stress-resilient, but she doesn't seem to be completely unaffected by stressors. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems fitting, but since 5 is closer to the upper end of the spectrum, I would predict she leans towards 4 or 5.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on Angela's description, she seems to have a balanced and fulfilling life centered around her family, work, and community involvement. She mentions participating in volunteer work, which often involves community activities that can be artistic or creative. Additionally, she has shown interest in Marcus's development and growth, which might extend to fostering his artistic interests. While Angela doesn't explicitly mention a strong passion for arts herself, her life appears to be enriched by various activities and interests, suggesting she is not someone who sees herself as lacking in artistic interests entirely.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on Angela's description, she seems to be someone who values her relationships and enjoys spending time with her family and friends. She mentions having a close network of friends and family, and her involvement in community activities and church suggests she is sociable. While she does mention challenges in managing work and family responsibilities, her overall description indicates a preference for social interactions.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on Angela's responses, she seems to value her family and community, and she mentions that she values the stability and love that her family brings. This suggests she is generally positive and supportive rather than critical. Additionally, she talks about finding fulfillment in nurturing her son's growth and supporting her community, which further indicates she is more inclined to see the good in others rather than focusing on faults.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on Angela's description of herself and her life, she seems like someone who values thoroughness and attention to detail. She has a background in education and business, where thoroughness and precision are often valued. Additionally, her current role as a marketing manager requires her to be meticulous in her work, developing and executing campaigns that need to be well-thought-out and detailed. Her comments on her work and her commitment to Marcus's education also suggest a strong desire to be thorough and attentive to details.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on Angela's description of her life, she seems to have a relatively stable and fulfilling life. She mentions that she has a good support system, a stable job, and a strong family life. While she does mention some challenges like managing work and family during the pandemic, she also talks about coping mechanisms and strategies to deal with stress. This suggests she is generally not overly nervous or anxious. Therefore, it is more likely that she would choose a lower number on the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the information provided in the interview, Angela Hubbell does not seem to be someone who prioritizes or engages in imaginative thinking as a core part of her life. She focuses more on practical matters like her job, family responsibilities, and community involvement. She doesn't mention having hobbies or activities that require a lot of imagination, nor does she discuss her creativity in detail. Therefore, it seems more likely that she would place herself lower on the scale, closer to 1."

She has a stable and fulfilling life, manages a team, and has navigated various challenges. However, she also mentions experiencing stress and the need for coping mechanisms, suggesting she might not be overly confident in all aspects of problem-solving. Given her experiences, a moderate score like 3 or 4 seems most fitting, but considering the phrasing of the question, she might lean slightly towards acknowledging her limitations, which could make a 1 or 2 more likely.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Angela Hubbell does not seem to have any specific indication of struggling with logical analysis. She describes herself as a marketing manager and has taken on roles that require problem-solving and strategic thinking. This suggests she likely has some capability in logical analysis. However, she also does not indicate being exceptionally good at it. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems most appropriate, but given the range, a 4 or 5 would be slightly more fitting as it indicates some confidence in her abilities without overstating them.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Angela describes herself as someone who values education and has made significant decisions based on her interests and support from advisors.

However, she also describes her daily life as a mix of work commitments and family time, which suggests a pragmatic approach to balancing responsibilities. Given her comments about adapting to new challenges and finding ways to manage her life, it seems she doesn't overly rely on impulsive decisions. However, she does mention that balancing work and family can be challenging, indicating a tendency towards practical, rather than over-analytical, decision-making. This suggests she leans slightly towards the middle of the scale.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Angela describes herself as someone who has managed to adapt and find effective coping mechanisms to deal with stress, such as starting a gratitude journal and resuming her exercise routine. These traits suggest that she is reasonably adept at handling pressure. However, the statement asks about reasoning ability specifically, which might be slightly different from overall stress management. Given that Angela mentions experiencing stress during the pandemic but has coping strategies, it suggests she does have some capacity to reason well under pressure, albeit possibly not as well as someone who strongly disagrees with the statement.",
            "REI_6": "Based on Angela's description, she seems to have a balanced and realistic view of herself. She doesn't claim to be exceptionally brilliant, nor does she seem to undervalue her abilities.

Her career as a marketing manager and her involvement in strategic planning suggest a logical and analytical mindset.

Therefore, it is unlikely that she would choose 1.",
            "REI_3": "Based on Angela's responses, she seems to value a balanced approach between intuition and logic. She has mentioned that she tries to focus on the positives and maintain a healthy lifestyle, which suggests a practical and thoughtful mindset. However, she has also expressed reliance on her faith and community support, indicating a more intuitive side. Given her description of balancing work and family responsibilities, it's likely she leans slightly towards the middle of the scale, acknowledging her capacity for analysis but also recognizing her more intuitive tendencies.",
            "REI_4": "Based on Angela's responses, she seems to value community, support systems, and balance in her life. She mentions that she tries to find effective coping mechanisms, prioritize self-care, and maintain open lines of communication. This suggests she is thoughtful about her actions and decisions, even if not always in a detailed, analytical manner. She does not seem to be someone who acts purely on impulse or without consideration, but she also doesn't appear to be overly analytical. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 or slightly lower would be a reasonable prediction.",
            "REI_5": "Based on Angela's interview responses, she seems to be someone who values stability and support in her life. She talks about her supportive family, community, and her ability to manage work and family responsibilities.

            "REI_6": "Based on Angela's description, she seems to have a balanced view of herself. While she values her professional success and the support of her community, she doesn't explicitly highlight exceptional logical reasoning skills. Her focus is more on her family, faith, and community involvement. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume she would not place herself at the highest end of the scale, but also not at the lowest end. Given her conservative political views and emphasis on stability and community, a middle ground seems most fitting.",
            "REI_7": "Based on Angela's description, she appears to have a background in business administration and marketing, which often require analytical skills and strategic thinking. Additionally, she mentions that her job involves managing a team and developing campaigns, which suggests a level of logical and strategic thinking. Furthermore, her involvement in mentoring junior marketers and contributing to community events indicates a structured and organized approach to problem-solving and planning.

            "REI_9": "Based on Angela's background and current role, it's reasonable to assume that she values and uses logic in her daily life and work. As a marketing manager, she needs to analyze data, make strategic decisions, and solve problems systematically. Additionally, her detailed planning and organizational skills suggest a strong reliance on logical thinking. Given her professional and personal life experiences, it seems more likely that she would lean towards the higher end of the scale.",
            "REI_10": "Based on Angela's responses, she seems to be someone who values reason and logic in her decision-making. Throughout the interview, she provides clear explanations for her choices, such as her decision to switch majors and her reasons for homeschooling Marcus.
