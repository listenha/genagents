Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAmanda Hollins: Well, I was born in Texas, in a small town in the West South Central region, and I grew up in a pretty stable household. My parents were both graduates, which meant they valued education a lot, and I was raised with that same mindset. We weren't poor by any means\u2014my family was far above average in terms of income, so I never had to worry about basic needs. I remember my mom working full-time as a teacher, and my dad was in a management position at a local business. I lived with both of them until I left for college. I was always a pretty curious kid, and I think that's what led me to pursue a bachelor's degree in social work. I wanted to make a difference in people's lives, especially in communities that didn't have a lot of resources. I moved to Austin for college, and I've been here ever since. It's been a few years now, and I'm working full-time as a case manager at a nonprofit that helps homeless individuals. I'm pretty proud of that, even though it's not the easiest job. I'm a strong Democrat, and I believe in equality, social justice, and making sure everyone has access to the same opportunities I had. I'm not religious anymore, but I was raised Protestant, and I still respect the values I learned growing up. I've never been married, and I don't see myself getting married anytime soon\u2014I'm focused on my career and making an impact in my community.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAmanda Hollins: There was definitely a crossroads, and it happened during my sophomore year of college. I was studying psychology at the time, and I had the opportunity to volunteer at a local shelter that helped homeless families. I had always been interested in helping others, but that experience opened my eyes to the systemic issues that contribute to homelessness\u2014things like lack of affordable housing, mental health support, and access to basic healthcare. I remember one particular night when I met a woman named Maria, who had been living on the streets for over a year after losing her job and being evicted. She was trying to get back on her feet, but the system was just too overwhelming for her. That night, I realized that I couldn't just be a psychologist treating symptoms\u2014I wanted to be someone who could help change the system itself. So I switched my major to social work, and I've never looked back. It was a tough decision because it meant starting over with a new major and a new set of courses, but it felt right. That experience shaped who I am today, and it's what led me to the nonprofit I work at now. I think that moment was the turning point that defined my path.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nAmanda Hollins: I think it was a conscious choice, but not in the way you might expect. It wasn't like I suddenly had a moment of clarity and everything clicked into place. It was more of a gradual realization, like peeling back layers of understanding. I had always wanted to help people, but I didn't fully grasp the depth of the issues until I saw the system up close. Meeting Maria was the catalyst, but it was the conversations I had with her, the stories she shared, and the way she kept trying despite everything that made me realize I needed to be more than just a helper\u2014I needed to be an advocate. I made a decision to change my major, but I also made a decision to commit myself fully to this path, even when it was hard. I think that's what makes it a conscious choice: it wasn't just about switching majors, it was about redefining my purpose and being willing to work for it.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Do you think another person or an organization could have lent a helping hand during moments like this?\n\nAmanda Hollins: Absolutely, I think having support from others made a huge difference. When I was struggling with the decision to switch my major, my professor in the psychology department, Dr. Carter, noticed I was losing focus. She sat me down and asked me what was going on, and I told her about my time at the shelter. She didn't try to convince me to stay in psychology\u2014instead, she encouraged me to explore social work and even connected me with a mentor in the field. That mentor, a woman named Lisa, became a real lifeline for me. She shared her own journey of switching careers later in life and helped me see that it was okay to change paths. I also had friends who were in social work programs, and they were incredibly supportive when I decided to make the switch. Looking back, I don't think I would have had the confidence to make that change without their encouragement. It's a reminder that even when we feel like we're on our own, there are people and organizations out there who are willing to help if we're open to it.\n\n",

My focus has been on my career and making sure I'm making a real difference in the lives of others. That said, my family is still very important to me. My parents are both still in Texas, and even though I moved to Austin for college and haven't lived in the same state since I was 16, we stay in touch regularly. My mom still works as a teacher, and my dad is retired now but volunteers with a local nonprofit that supports education in underserved communities. They've always been proud of me, even when I made the decision to switch my major and pursue social work. I think they saw it as a natural extension of the values they raised me with. I also have a younger sister who's in graduate school for public policy, so we talk a lot about our shared interests in social justice and community advocacy. While I'm not married and don't have children of my own, my family is a big part of my life, and I feel lucky to have such supportive parents and a sibling who shares my passion for making the world a better place.\n\n",

I never really thought about how much my upbringing influenced my values and career path until I was asked to explain it all. The moment with Maria at the shelter was a turning point, and I realized that my desire to help others wasn't just about being kind\u2014it was about fighting for systemic change. It's also humbling to think about how much support I received from others, like Dr. Carter and Lisa, who helped me make that big decision.

He used to say that everyone deserves a second chance, and I think that belief really shaped me. As for my sister, we've always had a strong bond.

One of them is Jordan, who I met in college. We were both involved in campus activism, and we've stayed close even after graduation. Jordan works in community organizing, and we often collaborate on local initiatives\u2014like food drives or voter registration events. He's one of the few people who really gets where I'm coming from, and he's always pushing me to think critically about the work I do. Then there's Priya, who's a nurse at the same nonprofit I work at. She's been a huge support system for me, especially during the more stressful times. We've had some really deep conversations about the challenges of working in social services and how to keep our passion alive in the face of burnout.

It's a mix of old and new\u2014there are historic homes next to newer developments, and a lot of community-driven spaces. I live in a small apartment near the downtown area, which is convenient because I work in the nonprofit sector and often need to be downtown for meetings or events.

But for the most part, the community here is very watchful of one another. I've never had any serious issues, and I think that's because people here are pretty connected. There are neighborhood watch groups, local events that bring people together, and a general sense that we're all in this together. I also feel safe because of the diversity of the area\u2014there's a lot of different people, cultures, and perspectives, which creates a kind of natural balance. I know that safety isn't just about the absence of danger, but also about feeling supported and seen. In East Austin, I feel both of those things, which makes it a place I can truly call home.\n\n",

There's always something happening\u2014whether it's a local protest, a neighborhood clean-up, or a cultural festival. It keeps me motivated and reminds me why I chose this path.

I usually start my week early\u2014most mornings I'm up by 6:30 or 7, making coffee and getting ready for work. My job as a case manager is pretty demanding, so I have to be on time and focused.

It's not always easy balancing everything, but I find that having a variety of tasks keeps me engaged and prevents burnout.

I know that my job can be emotionally draining, so I've started seeing a therapist once a month to check in and process any challenges I might be facing. I've also been more mindful about getting enough sleep, which has made a big difference in how I feel overall. I used to be pretty good at ignoring stress, but I've learned that it's not sustainable.

But after a few months of it getting worse, I finally saw a doctor, and it turned out to be a herniated disc. It was a bit of a wake-up call for me. I had to take a few weeks off work to focus on physical therapy and rest, which was tough because I was used to being so active and involved in my community. It was frustrating at first, but it also gave me the chance to slow down and really focus on my recovery. I started incorporating more stretching into my routine, and I made sure to take breaks during the day to avoid sitting for too long. It was a reminder that even people who are generally healthy can face unexpected challenges, and it made me more aware of the importance of listening to my body. I'm doing much better now, but I've learned to be more mindful of how I move and sit throughout the day. It's also made me more empathetic toward others who are dealing with chronic pain or injuries\u2014they don't always have the luxury of slowing down, and that's something I try to keep in mind in my work with clients.\n\n",

How about you?\n\nAmanda Hollins: It's definitely affected my work in some ways, especially in the beginning when I was dealing with the pain and physical therapy. I had to adjust my schedule, take more breaks, and sometimes I'd have to delegate tasks or ask for support from my team. It was humbling to realize that even though I'm used to being the one who helps others, I needed help too. At first, it was hard to admit that I couldn't do everything on my own, but over time, I learned to lean on my colleagues and friends when I needed to. It also made me more compassionate toward my clients who are dealing with their own health challenges\u2014whether it's chronic pain, mental health struggles, or something else. I think it deepened my understanding of what it means to be resilient and to ask for help when you need it. While it was a tough experience, it ultimately made me a better worker and a better person, and I'm grateful for the lessons it taught me.\n\n",

Tell me all about how you have been feeling.\n\nAmanda Hollins: Over the past year, I've had a lot of mixed emotions\u2014there's been a lot of growth, but also a lot of challenges. On one hand, I feel more grounded in my work and more confident in the impact I'm making, even if it's slow progress. I've taken on more leadership roles at the nonprofit, which has been both exciting and overwhelming at times. I've also started mentoring some new case managers, which is something I never imagined I'd be doing a few years ago. It's rewarding to see them grow and to know that I can pass on some of the lessons I've learned along the way. On the other hand, the past year has been emotionally heavy. I've seen more people struggling than ever before, especially with the ongoing effects of the pandemic and rising costs of living. It's hard not to feel discouraged sometimes, knowing that the system we're trying to change is so deeply entrenched. But I also feel a deep sense of purpose, and I remind myself that even small victories\u2014like helping someone find stable housing or connect with a support group\u2014matter. I've also been working on my own emotional resilience, which has been a journey. I've started journaling more, and it's helped me process the stress and stay connected to my values. Overall, I feel like I'm in a place where I'm learning to balance the weight of the work with the importance of self-care, and that's something I'm really trying to hold onto.\n\n",

It's not something I used to talk about openly, but I've come to realize that acknowledging it is the first step toward managing it. I've started seeing a therapist regularly, which has been really helpful. It's not that I'm depressed, but there are definitely days when the weight of everything feels too heavy to carry. I've learned to recognize the signs\u2014like when I'm constantly on edge, having trouble sleeping, or feeling like I can't focus on anything for more than a few minutes. I've also started practicing mindfulness more consistently, which has helped me stay grounded when things feel chaotic.

But they've also been worried about the toll my work takes on me\u2014especially after I dealt with the back injury. They've made it a point to check in on me more often, and my mom even started sending me care packages with things like healthy snacks, yoga mats, and books to help me stay grounded. My sister, on the other hand, has been more of a sounding board for me. She's been going through her own challenges with graduate school and balancing her activism work, so we've had a lot of late-night conversations about how to stay resilient in the face of burnout.

As I got older, I found that the rigid structures and doctrines of organized religion didn't quite resonate with me anymore. What I do believe in, though, is the idea of interconnectedness\u2014the understanding that we're all part of something bigger, whether that's the community, the environment, or the shared human experience. I find meaning in small, everyday moments: the way the sun feels on my skin, the quiet strength of people who keep going despite everything, or the way a simple act of kindness can ripple out and change someone's day. I also think about the values I was taught growing up\u2014things like compassion, integrity, and the importance of helping others\u2014and I try to carry those with me in everything I do. It's not about faith in a higher power for me, but more about faith in the goodness of people and the possibility of change.

I'm not really into scrolling through endless feeds or comparing my life to others. Instead, I use it as a tool to stay informed and connected to the causes I care about. I follow a lot of local activists, nonprofit organizations, and community leaders in Austin who are doing important work in social justice, housing, and education. I also use Instagram to share some of the stories I come across in my work\u2014like client success stories or moments of hope that remind me why I keep going. It's not always easy to share those stories, because some of them are really heavy, but I think it's important to highlight the resilience of the people I work with.

I try to be intentional about how I use these platforms, though\u2014I set limits on how much time I spend online, and I make sure it's not taking away from my mental health or my work.

That said, there have been moments when I've turned to online forums or support groups for people in similar fields\u2014like social workers or activists\u2014where we can share experiences and advice. It's not the same as having someone physically there, but it does provide a sense of solidarity.

I live in a small apartment in East Austin, and the rent is pretty steep for the size and location, especially with the rising cost of living here. I try to keep it manageable by sticking to a strict budget, but it's still a significant chunk of my income.

Transportation is also a challenge. While I bike to work a few times a week, I still rely on the bus or rideshares on other days, and those costs can add up, especially when I'm working late or have to travel to different parts of the city for meetings. I also set aside money for my therapy sessions and yoga classes, which I consider essential for my well-being. I've had to be really careful with my spending, and sometimes I have to make tough choices, like skipping a meal out or delaying a purchase, just to stay on track.

Typically, I spend closer to $3,000 to $3,200, depending on how many times I need to use rideshares or if I have to buy anything extra for work-related events or client support. The majority of that goes to rent, which is about $1,400 a month, and groceries, which usually run me around $600 to $700. Transportation is another big chunk\u2014around $300 to $400, including bus passes, bike maintenance, and occasional rideshares. I also set aside about $200 for my therapy sessions and yoga classes, which I consider non-negotiable for my mental health. The rest goes toward utilities, personal care, and a small savings fund.

For example, during the winter months, my utility bills\u2014especially heating\u2014go up a bit, and I have to budget for that. I also noticed that during the holidays, my grocery expenses increase because I tend to buy more fresh produce and ingredients for meals I make for friends or for clients I'm supporting.

In the summer, I use the bus more often because biking in the heat isn't always practical, and that adds a bit more to my monthly transportation costs.

    "content": "Interviewer: What is or was your occupation? In this occupation, what kind of work do you do and what are the most important activities or duties?\n\nAmanda Hollins: My occupation is a case manager at a nonprofit organization called Austin Hope Alliance, and it's one of the most meaningful roles I've ever had. As a case manager, my primary responsibilities involve working directly with individuals and families who are experiencing homelessness, domestic violence, or other crises. I meet with clients regularly to assess their needs, create personalized support plans, and connect them with resources like housing assistance, mental health services, and job training programs. One of the most important parts of my job is building trust with my clients\u2014many of them have been through a lot, and they need someone they can rely on. I also coordinate with other departments within the organization, like legal aid or healthcare partners, to make sure clients get the full range of support they need. The most challenging part of the job is seeing the systemic barriers that keep people stuck in cycles of poverty and instability, but it's also incredibly rewarding to be part of someone's journey toward stability, even if it's just a small step. I think what keeps me going is knowing that even though the work is tough, it's making a real difference in people's lives.\n\n",

Some weeks are busier than others, especially when we're coordinating with other organizations or preparing for community outreach events. I try to stick to a standard 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. schedule, but I often end up staying late a few days a week to wrap up reports or meet with clients who need extra support. I've learned to be flexible with my time, but I also make it a point to set boundaries so I can recharge. It's not always easy, especially when I see clients who are in really tough situations, but I remind myself that I can only do so much, and that taking care of myself is part of the job too.\n\n",

It started as a way to stay connected to the issues I care about and to keep my creative side engaged, especially since my full-time job can be so emotionally intense. I usually write articles or op-eds on topics related to social justice, housing, and mental health, and it's been a great way to share stories that might not always get told. I work about 10 to 15 hours a week on these projects, mostly on weekends or evenings after work. It's not a huge income boost, but it helps me feel more balanced and gives me a different kind of fulfillment. Plus, it allows me to use my voice in ways that complement my case management work. I've also been thinking about expanding into more digital content, like blog posts or social media campaigns, to reach a wider audience. It's a small part of my life, but it adds another layer to how I contribute to the causes I believe in.\n\n",

It's not a huge amount, especially when you factor in the cost of living here in Austin, but it's enough to cover my rent, groceries, transportation, and a few other essentials. I've been trying to be really mindful of how I spend my money, especially since I know how much of my income goes toward basic needs. I also set aside a small portion each month for savings, even if it's just a few hundred dollars.

The benefits of the job are pretty standard for a nonprofit\u2014health insurance is one of the biggest ones, though it's not always the most comprehensive, especially when it comes to mental health coverage.

I have a good relationship with my manager, Sarah, who I think genuinely cares about her team and the impact we make. She's been a great mentor to me, especially in the early days of my career, and she's always encouraged me to take on more responsibility when I'm ready. I admire her dedication and the way she leads with empathy, even when the workload is heavy. As for my coworkers, we have a strong sense of camaraderie. We all know the challenges of the work we do, and that creates a kind of unspoken bond. We support each other through the tough days, whether it's by covering for someone who's overwhelmed or just checking in to see how someone is doing. There's a lot of trust and mutual respect, which is important in a field where we're dealing with people's most vulnerable moments.

I usually start at 8:30 a.m. and end at 5:00 p.m., but I often stay late a few days a week to wrap up reports or meet with clients who need extra support. The flexibility is both a blessing and a challenge. On one hand, it allows me to be responsive to the people I work with, which is important when their situations are urgent or evolving. On the other hand, it can make it harder to set clear boundaries between work and personal time. I've learned to be intentional about when I leave the office and how I manage my time outside of work, but it's not always easy. There are days when I need to adjust my schedule last minute for a client meeting or a community event, and that can throw off my routine.

I make enough to cover my basic needs and a small savings, but I'm always aware of how quickly things can shift\u2014whether it's a medical bill, a sudden increase in rent, or a period where my freelance work dries up.
