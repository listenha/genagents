  "agent_profile_summary": "Amanda Hollins, a 23-year-old case manager in Austin, Texas, grew up in a stable, educated household in the West South Central region, where her parents’ careers as a teacher and business manager instilled in her a deep respect for service and community. A pivotal moment came during her sophomore year of college when volunteering at a homeless shelter exposed her to systemic inequities, leading her to switch from psychology to social work—a decision that reshaped her career path and reinforced her commitment to advocacy. Now working full-time at a nonprofit focused on supporting homeless individuals, she balances her demanding job with mindfulness practices, community involvement, and a small but growing savings account. Her life is guided by a tension between the urgency of her work and the need for personal well-being, and she relates to others with empathy, often drawing on her own experiences of struggle and resilience to connect with those she serves."
