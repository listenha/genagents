My own experience with math has been one of gradual complexity, where foundational concepts build up to more intricate ideas. While I appreciate the logic and structure of math, I also recognize its depth and the creativity required to solve complex problems. This makes me place it somewhere in the middle, leaning slightly toward the complex side due to the depth and abstract nature of higher-level math."

Their extinction was a random event that shaped the course of life on Earth, which aligns more with the idea that history is not always progressive or linear. While evolution can be viewed as a form of improvement, the extinction of dinosaurs was not a step forward in a predictable sense.
