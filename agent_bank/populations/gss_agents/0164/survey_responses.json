Her lifestyle and mindset suggest she is motivated and proactive.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Amanda has described experiencing anxiety and emotional strain due to the demanding nature of her work, particularly in dealing with clients facing significant challenges. While she has made efforts to manage her stress through mindfulness, therapy, and self-care, she also acknowledges that there are days when the weight of her work feels overwhelming. This suggests she does not consistently see herself as someone who handles stress exceptionally well, though she is actively working on it.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Amanda Hollins mentions that she values community, social justice, and helping others, and while she engages in activities like yoga, reading, and volunteering, there is no mention of artistic pursuits such as painting, music, or creative writing. Her focus appears to be on practical, service-oriented activities rather than artistic ones. This suggests she would likely rate herself lower on the scale of having artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Amanda describes herself as being deeply connected to her community, working with clients, and having a strong support system of friends and family. She is involved in community organizing, volunteers, and collaborates with colleagues and friends on social justice initiatives.

            "BFI-10_9": "Amanda has described experiencing anxiety, particularly in relation to the emotional weight of her work and the challenges she faces in her personal life. She has acknowledged feeling overwhelmed at times and has taken steps to manage her mental health, such as seeing a therapist and practicing mindfulness. This suggests she is not entirely free from nervousness, but she also has coping mechanisms in place. Her response would likely fall somewhere in the middle, but leaning toward the higher end of the scale due to the emotional demands of her job.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Amanda describes herself as someone who is deeply engaged in her work, particularly in social justice and helping others. She reflects on her past experiences, such as her time at the shelter and her decision to switch majors, which shows she is reflective and thoughtful. However, she does not explicitly mention creativity, imagination, or artistic pursuits. Her focus is more on practical, real-world impact rather than abstract or imaginative thinking. While she is introspective and values stories (like Maria’s), this seems more tied to empathy and understanding than to imagination in the creative sense."
