While she has made efforts to manage her stress through mindfulness, therapy, and self-care, she also acknowledges that there are days when the weight of her work feels overwhelming.

She has acknowledged feeling overwhelmed at times and has taken steps to manage her mental health, such as seeing a therapist and practicing mindfulness. This suggests she is not entirely free from nervousness, but she also has coping mechanisms in place. Her response would likely fall somewhere in the middle, but leaning toward the higher end of the scale due to the emotional demands of her job.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Amanda describes herself as someone who is deeply engaged in her work, particularly in social justice and helping others. She reflects on her past experiences, such as her time at the shelter and her decision to switch majors, which shows she is reflective and thoughtful. However, she does not explicitly mention creativity, imagination, or artistic pursuits. Her focus is more on practical, real-world impact rather than abstract or imaginative thinking.

            "BFI-10_9": "Amanda has mentioned experiencing anxiety, especially related to the emotional weight of her work with homeless individuals and systemic issues. She also described having moments where the weight of her job felt overwhelming, even though she has developed coping strategies like mindfulness and therapy.
