However, if a horror movie is poorly made or lacks creativity, it could be boring. But overall, I think horror movies are more likely to be on the 'scared to death' side of the spectrum."

For someone like me, who has focused more on practical, day-to-day life rather than academic rigor, math is a tool that is useful but not overly complicated.
