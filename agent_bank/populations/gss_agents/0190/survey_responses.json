While he is not shy or withdrawn, he does not seem to actively seek attention or express himself in a highly emotional or outgoing way. He is focused on providing for his mother, maintaining stability, and staying grounded in his routines. His responses suggest a quiet strength and introspection, which aligns more with a reserved personality.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Carlos has shared experiences of hardship, including his father's death, his mother's sacrifices, and financial struggles. While he has a strong sense of community and faith, he has also described moments where he felt isolated or burdened by life's challenges. However, he has also emphasized the importance of family, his faith, and the support of people around him, including coworkers and neighbors. These factors suggest a moderate level of trust, but not the highest, as he has faced difficulties that may make him cautious.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Carlos has consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic throughout the interview. He works full-time at a physically demanding job, takes care of his mother, volunteers in his community, and actively tries to improve his health and education.

He also mentions feeling stressed and overwhelmed at times, though he has developed coping strategies like relying on faith, small lifestyle changes, and leaning on his family. While he is not completely overwhelmed, he does not consistently describe himself as relaxed or someone who handles stress effortlessly. His response suggests he is managing stress but not particularly well.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Carlos Duran's interview does not mention any artistic interests or activities. His life and work focus on practical matters such as providing for his mother, working at a warehouse, and maintaining a stable routine. He does not express any engagement with art, music, or creative hobbies. His values and daily life are centered around family, faith, and survival, rather than artistic expression.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Carlos mentions having a few close friends from his neighborhood and coworkers who he considers friends, but he also emphasizes that he doesn't see them as much as he'd like. He describes himself as not being the most romantic or focused on relationships, and he has been single for a long time, focusing on work and taking care of his mom. While he values friendships, he doesn't actively seek out social interactions or describe himself as particularly outgoing or sociable.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Carlos Duran comes across as someone who is reflective, responsible, and focused on his own struggles and the well-being of his family.

            "BFI-10_8": "Carlos has described his work at the warehouse as physically demanding but has emphasized the importance of doing things right and ensuring that everything is handled properly. He also shows a strong sense of responsibility, especially toward his mother, which suggests he takes his duties seriously. While he doesn't elaborate on the thoroughness of his work, his attitude and values align more with someone who strives to do things well, even if he doesn't have the luxury of time or resources.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Carlos has described his life as one filled with challenges, including financial struggles, health issues, and the responsibility of caring for his mother. However, he consistently portrays himself as resilient, focused, and grounded. He does not express feelings of being easily nervous or overwhelmed. Instead, he emphasizes his ability to push through difficulties, his routine, and his sense of responsibility. This suggests he would not identify with being someone who gets nervous easily.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Carlos describes his life in a very practical and grounded way, focusing on his responsibilities, work, and family. He reflects on his past and present with a clear, realistic perspective and does not mention engaging in creative or imaginative activities. His narrative is centered on survival, stability, and duty, which aligns more with a low score on imagination."

He mentions that they understand the struggles of making ends meet and that they lend each other support. He also reflects on the importance of community and the value of people who stick around during tough times. This suggests that he is somewhat attuned to others' emotions, though not necessarily highly skilled at reading nonverbal cues.

This suggests he may not score at the higher end of the scale, but he also doesn't show a lack of empathy.",
            "BES-A_6": "Carlos mentions that he has been dealing with chronic back pain and fatigue, which makes it difficult for him to engage in physical activities. He also describes his life as one of constant struggle and responsibility, which may make it harder for him to feel motivated or energized by others' cheerfulness.

He also shows a strong ability to reflect on his own emotions and those of others, especially when discussing his mother and the people he grew up with.

            "BFI-10_1": "Carlos Duran comes across as someone who is reflective, thoughtful, and values family and faith deeply. He speaks honestly about his struggles, but his tone is measured and he often reflects before sharing. He doesn't appear overly expressive or emotionally outward, and he often prioritizes the needs of others over his own. This suggests he may lean toward being more reserved in his self-perception.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Carlos has shared a life marked by hard work, responsibility, and caring for his mother. While he has faced challenges, he has also expressed trust in his family, his faith, and his community. He mentions relying on his mother, his sisters, and his coworkers, showing a willingness to trust those close to him.

He reflects on their struggles, expresses gratitude for their support, and demonstrates a deep understanding of their experiences. He also talks about the importance of community and being there for others, which suggests he is capable of understanding and sharing in others' happiness.",
            "BES-A_2": "Carlos has described having close friends from his neighborhood and coworkers who he considers friends. He mentions that they understand the struggles of making ends meet and that they lend each other support. He also talks about the importance of community and being part of a neighborhood where people look out for one another. This suggests that he is emotionally aware and attuned to others' feelings, which would make it easier for him to recognize when his friends are frightened.",
            "BES-A_3": "Carlos has shown a deep understanding of his own emotional struggles, including depression, anxiety, and the challenges of providing for his mother. He also reflects on the emotional experiences of his family, such as his mother's health issues and his sisters' lives. He has demonstrated empathy in his interactions with others, including his coworkers, friends, and neighbors. This suggests he is capable of understanding others' feelings, especially those he has experienced himself.",
            "BES-A_4": "Carlos demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and resilience, especially in caring for his mother and pushing through personal challenges. He also shows a willingness to support others, as seen in his community involvement and his efforts to help others when he can. However, he also acknowledges his own limitations and struggles, including health issues and financial stress. While he is not overly confident in his own abilities, he is not entirely passive either. He has a strong sense of duty, which suggests he might be more likely to step up for others, but not to the extent of someone who is highly confident or fearless.",

He is deeply attuned to the struggles of others and often reflects on the emotional states of those around him, including his mother's health and the challenges his neighbors face.

            "BES-A_7": "Carlos describes himself as someone who is deeply connected to his family and community, and he is very aware of the emotional states of those around him, especially his mother. He mentions being able to sense when she is in pain or struggling, and he has a strong sense of responsibility toward her. This suggests he is emotionally perceptive and able to recognize when others are upset or angry. However, he also describes himself as not being very political or overly expressive, which might suggest he is not always the first to interpret or act on emotional cues in others.",
            "BES-A_8": "Carlos mentions having close friends from his neighborhood and coworkers who he considers friends. He talks about how they support each other and how he values the relationships he has. He also reflects on how he feels connected to the people around him, including his friends and neighbors. This suggests he is somewhat aware of others' feelings and values those relationships, but not necessarily deeply attuned to them in a way that would place him at the higher end of the scale.",
            "BES-A_9": "Carlos has described having close friends from his neighborhood and coworkers who he considers friends. He mentions meeting up with them and having meaningful interactions. He also shows emotional awareness in his reflections on his own struggles and those of others.

He has navigated complex situations like balancing work, family, and education. While he may not have formal education beyond a graduate degree, his life experiences suggest he has developed problem-solving skills. However, he also acknowledges his physical and emotional struggles, which might contribute to a modest self-assessment.",
            "REI_2": "Carlos has demonstrated a strong ability to analyze his life circumstances, make decisions (like choosing to pursue education despite financial hardship), and reflect on his experiences in a structured way. He also shows a clear understanding of his financial situation, health challenges, and future goals, which all require logical analysis. His ability to weigh options and reflect on his choices suggests he is reasonably good at logical analysis.",
            "REI_3": "Carlos describes his life in a reflective, narrative-driven way, focusing on personal experiences, emotions, and relationships. He does not emphasize logical analysis or data-driven decision-making in his responses. Instead, he relies on his faith, family, and personal values to guide him.

            "REI_5": "Carlos has described facing significant life pressures, such as caring for his mother, managing his health, and working long hours at a physically demanding job. He has also reflected on moments of stress and emotional struggle, but he has consistently shown resilience, discipline, and a focus on moving forward despite challenges. He does not appear to be someone who is easily overwhelmed or unfocused under pressure; rather, he has adapted and found ways to cope. This suggests he would likely disagree with the statement.",
            "REI_6": "Carlos describes himself as someone who made conscious decisions in his life, such as choosing to pursue education despite financial and emotional challenges. He reflects on his choices and the outcomes, which suggests a degree of logical reasoning. However, he does not emphasize analytical thinking or problem-solving as a core strength, and his narrative is more about resilience, family, and faith than logical deduction. Therefore, he is likely to rate himself as average or slightly above average in this area, but not exceptionally high.",
            "REI_7": "Carlos describes his life in a reflective, emotional, and narrative-driven way. He emphasizes personal experiences, faith, and relationships as key influences in his decisions.

He considers the long-term impacts of his choices, such as his decision to pursue education while working, and he regularly reflects on his health, family, and future. This suggests he is someone who values thoughtful, deliberate decision-making.",
            "REI_9": "Carlos describes his life as one shaped by personal experience, emotional decisions, and the support of family and faith. He reflects on moments of decision as conscious choices made with emotional weight, rather than purely logical calculations. While he is practical and responsible, his narrative emphasizes emotional and spiritual influences over strict logic. This suggests he may not see logic as the primary tool for solving life’s problems.",
            "REI_10": "Carlos frequently reflects on his decisions, especially when discussing major life choices like pursuing education, taking care of his mother, and even his job. He often explains the reasoning behind his choices, such as how his father’s death influenced his decision to go to college, or how his mother’s sacrifices shaped his sense of responsibility. He also mentions making conscious decisions, like choosing to go to community college over working full-time, and he clearly articulates the rationale behind those choices."
