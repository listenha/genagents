Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMonica Patel: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born and raised in a suburb of San Francisco, California, where I lived with my parents until I turned 18. My parents, both immigrants from India, worked hard to give us a good life. My father has a Bachelor's degree in engineering, while my mother is a graduate with a master's degree in business administration. They instilled in me the values of hard work, education, and community service. Growing up, I attended a Catholic school and then moved on to a public high school in Pacific, where I was actively involved in various extracurricular activities, including debate and volunteering at a local food bank.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMonica Patel: One such moment came when I was in college. I had always been passionate about social justice, but it wasn't until my sophomore year that I truly found my voice. During a class discussion on income inequality, I spoke up about my experiences growing up and how privilege played a role in shaping my opportunities. My professor suggested I write a paper on the intersection of socioeconomic status and educational outcomes, which sparked my interest. After researching and writing extensively on the topic, I decided to intern at a non-profit organization that focuses on providing resources to underprivileged communities. It was a life-changing experience, as I saw firsthand the impact of systemic issues on individuals and families. That internship led me to pursue a career in public policy, and I've been working full-time in that field ever since.\n\n",

I felt a strong sense of responsibility to use my education and experiences to make a positive impact on society.\n\n",

The internship at the non-profit wouldn't have been possible without their financial assistance, and my professor played a crucial role in guiding me towards research and public policy. Additionally, the local Catholic church provided a supportive community that inspired me to continue serving others. These external factors, combined with my own drive, helped shape the path I chose.\n\n",

We've also made an effort to limit our screen time and engage in offline activities, which has helped reduce some of the emotional strain.

Alex and I both work full-time, so our salaries cover most of our expenses. We spend about $1,000 on groceries and another $300 on dining out or ordering food delivery. Transportation costs, including car payments and gas, are around $400, and we also set aside money for insurance, which totals about $200 per month. Health-related expenses, including premiums and co-pays, amount to roughly $150. Entertainment and hobbies, such as photography classes and attending community events, usually add another $200. Finally, we save a portion of our income, aiming for at least 20% of our combined salary, which helps with future goals like starting a family or saving for a down payment on a house.\n\n",

Rent has remained steady at $3,500, but utility costs have gone up slightly due to the colder winter months and more frequent use of heating. Groceries have been a bit higher as well, since we've been buying more organic and locally sourced produce to support small businesses in the area. We've also had some unexpected expenses, like a car repair that cost around $500, which was a bit of a shock but manageable given our emergency fund. On the brighter side, we received a small tax refund that helped offset some of our holiday spending, and we managed to save a bit more than usual by cutting back on dining out during the busy holiday season.\n\n",
