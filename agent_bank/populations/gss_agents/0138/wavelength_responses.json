Based on my personal experiences, most horror movies fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum—enough to be unsettling or thrilling but not so extreme as to be 'scared to death.' I’ve seen some that were genuinely frightening, but they were exceptions. On the other hand, I’ve also seen horror movies that were forgettable or unengaging, but those are also rare. Overall, I think a horror movie is more likely to be on the 'scared' end of the spectrum than the 'bored' end, but not to the extreme of being 'scared to death.'"

My own experiences—like the time I had to choose between my education and helping my family—show that life is full of both predictable challenges and unexpected twists.

My own experiences with my children, for example, show how beauty can be found in simple, everyday moments that are meaningful to me but may not resonate the same way with others.

Given my own experiences of growing up in Philadelphia and maintaining a strong connection to my roots, I associate 'New City' with a subtle sense of displacement.
