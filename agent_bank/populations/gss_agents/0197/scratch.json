  "agent_profile_summary": "Hana Kim, a 30-year-old Korean-American woman living in San Francisco, grew up in the Pacific Northwest after moving from Seoul at age five. A graduate of cultural studies, she made a pivotal decision during her sophomore year to shift from literature to exploring the intersection of identity, language, and migration, a choice shaped by a semester spent in Seoul and a mentor's guidance. Now, she balances part-time work at a local bookstore with graduate studies, finding purpose in her research on diaspora narratives and teaching a small seminar on the topic. Her life is grounded in routine—cooking traditional Korean meals, meditating, and walking through her walkable neighborhood of Pacific Heights, where she feels a quiet sense of belonging. Hana navigates the tension between her Korean heritage and American upbringing, seeking to weave them into a coherent sense of self, and she values deep, meaningful connections with family, friends, and the community that supports her journey."
