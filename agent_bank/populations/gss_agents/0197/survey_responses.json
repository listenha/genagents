She also mentions that she tends to be selective in relationships and is selective about committing emotionally. These traits suggest a more reserved personality.

            "BFI-10_6": "Hana Kim describes herself as reflective, thoughtful, and more interested in reading and writing than in socializing as a child. While she has close friendships and values community, she also mentions being selective in romantic relationships and often feeling the need to be emotionally ready before committing. She also mentions that she doesn't use social media much and prefers quiet, in-person connections.

            "BFI-10_9": "Hana Kim mentioned experiencing anxiety, particularly during busy periods with work and school. She also described moments of feeling overwhelmed and having trouble sleeping. While she has learned to manage her anxiety through therapy, meditation, and self-compassion, she still acknowledges it as a part of her life. This suggests she would not rate herself as a 1, but she also does not describe her anxiety as overwhelming or constant, which would lean more toward a 5. A middle ground seems more accurate.",

She also mentions her interest in exploring the intersection of her Korean heritage and American upbringing, which suggests a strong imaginative and reflective nature.

She discusses moments of crossroads in her life, such as choosing to shift from literature to cultural studies, and she articulates the reasons behind her choices, such as her desire to explore identity and migration.

She has described feeling overwhelmed at times and has had to be intentional about managing her mental health through practices like meditation, writing, and seeking support from friends and a therapist. While she has made progress, she still identifies with moments of stress and the need to actively manage it, which suggests she would not rate herself as a 5.

However, she also emphasized learning to manage her anxiety through therapy, meditation, and self-compassion, suggesting she doesn't see herself as someone who gets nervous 'easily' in the most extreme sense. Her response seems to fall somewhere in the middle, but leaning closer to the lower end of the scale due to her acknowledgment of anxiety.",
