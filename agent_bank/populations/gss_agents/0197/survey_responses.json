She also mentions that she tends to be selective in relationships and is selective about committing emotionally. These traits suggest a more reserved personality.

            "BFI-10_6": "Hana Kim describes herself as reflective, thoughtful, and more interested in reading and writing than in socializing as a child. While she has close friendships and values community, she also mentions being selective in romantic relationships and often feeling the need to be emotionally ready before committing. She also mentions that she doesn't use social media much and prefers quiet, in-person connections.

            "BFI-10_9": "Hana Kim mentioned experiencing anxiety, particularly during busy periods with work and school. She also described moments of feeling overwhelmed and having trouble sleeping. While she has learned to manage her anxiety through therapy, meditation, and self-compassion, she still acknowledges it as a part of her life. This suggests she would not rate herself as a 1, but she also does not describe her anxiety as overwhelming or constant, which would lean more toward a 5. A middle ground seems more accurate.",

She also mentions her interest in exploring the intersection of her Korean heritage and American upbringing, which suggests a strong imaginative and reflective nature.
