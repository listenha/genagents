    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nHana Kim: I was born in Seoul, South Korea, but I moved to the United States when I was five years old with my parents, who were both working professionals. We settled in the Pacific Northwest, where I spent most of my childhood. Growing up, I was always fascinated by languages and cultures, which probably comes from my parents' love for learning and their desire to integrate into American society while holding onto our Korean heritage. My father was a professor at a local university, and my mother worked as a nurse. They both valued education, and I was expected to do well in school. I remember being a quiet child, more interested in reading and writing than in playing with other kids. I was baptized into the Catholic Church when I was eight, and that has been a significant part of my life ever since. I went to college in California, where I studied literature, and later earned my graduate degree in cultural studies. I've always felt like I was between two worlds\u2014my Korean roots and my American upbringing\u2014but that's also what makes me who I am today.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nHana Kim: There was a moment during my sophomore year of college that really shaped the direction of my life. I had just transferred to a university in California, and I was struggling to find my place both academically and socially. I had always been drawn to literature, but I was also deeply interested in understanding the cultural dynamics of being a Korean-American. I had the opportunity to join a study abroad program in Seoul for a semester, and I knew it would be a chance to reconnect with my roots and explore my identity more deeply. I told my parents about my decision, and they were supportive, though my mother was a bit worried about me being away from home for so long. I spent that semester immersed in Korean culture, taking classes on Korean literature and history, and even working part-time at a small bookstore in Seoul. It was there that I realized how much I missed the quiet, reflective life I had known growing up, but I also saw how my American education had given me a broader perspective. When I returned to California, I decided to shift my focus from literature to cultural studies, which allowed me to explore the intersection of identity, language, and migration. That experience was a turning point for me\u2014it helped me understand that I didn't have to choose between my Korean heritage and my American life; I could weave them together into something uniquely my own.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nHana Kim: I think it was a conscious choice, but not in the way I expected. At the time, I didn't feel like I was making a decision so much as I was being pulled by something deeper\u2014like my identity was trying to find its shape. I remember sitting in that bookstore in Seoul, surrounded by books in Korean, and feeling both at home and completely foreign. It was in that moment that I realized I wanted to understand not just my heritage, but how it interacted with the world I was living in now. I didn't just choose to study cultural studies; I felt like it was the only path that made sense for me. It wasn't about rejecting one part of myself for another\u2014it was about embracing the complexity of being in between, and finding my voice in that space.\n\n",

There was a professor at my university in California who had a background in Korean studies and had spent time living in both the U.S. and South Korea. She noticed that I was struggling to find my academic direction and invited me to her office one day. She shared her own story of navigating dual cultures and encouraged me to see my experiences not as a conflict, but as a unique strength. Her guidance gave me the confidence to pursue cultural studies, and she even helped me connect with the study abroad program in Seoul. I think if I hadn't had that conversation with her, I might have stayed in literature and never fully explored the depth of my identity. It was a small moment, but it had a huge impact on my life.\n\n",

Do you have a partner, or children?\n\nHana Kim: I currently don't have a partner or children, though I've had a few meaningful relationships over the years. I tend to be quite selective, partly because I want to make sure I'm emotionally ready to commit, and partly because my work and personal interests often take up a lot of my time. My family is still very important to me, especially my parents. They've always been supportive, even when I was making decisions that felt uncertain at the time. My father, in particular, has been a big influence on me\u2014his love for learning and his ability to see the world from multiple perspectives have shaped a lot of how I think. My mother, while more reserved, has always been a source of strength and stability. We don't talk about everything, but I know I can always count on her. I also keep in touch with my younger sister, who moved to New York a few years ago to pursue a career in fashion. We don't see each other as often as I'd like, but we stay connected through phone calls and messages. Family has always been a central part of my life, even as I've tried to carve out my own path.\n\n",

I realized how much my identity has been shaped by the tension and harmony between my Korean heritage and my American upbringing.

My paternal grandfather passed away when I was quite young, but I remember him as a quiet, thoughtful man who loved gardening and storytelling. My paternal grandmother is still alive, and she lives with us in San Francisco. She's a traditionalist, and while I sometimes find her views challenging, I respect her deeply. She's been a source of wisdom and grounding for me, especially during times when I felt torn between cultures. On my mother's side, my maternal grandfather is still alive, though he lives in Seoul. We don't see him as often as we'd like, but he sends us letters and photos from time to time. My relationship with him is more distant, but I know he cares. My maternal grandmother passed away when I was in high school, and I still feel her absence. She was the one who taught me how to cook traditional Korean dishes, and I often think about her when I'm in the kitchen.

One of them is Alex, a fellow graduate student I met during my time in cultural studies. We bonded over our shared interest in diaspora narratives and how identity is shaped by migration. Alex has been a great support system for me, especially during the more challenging times in my academic journey. We've been friends for over a decade now, and even though we've both moved in different directions professionally, we still meet up whenever we can. There's also my best friend from high school, Jamie, who I've known since we were kids. Jamie is more of a free spirit, always encouraging me to take risks and step out of my comfort zone.

It's a quiet, upscale area with a strong sense of community. I live in a small apartment on the second floor of a building that dates back to the early 20th century. The building has a lot of character\u2014original hardwood floors, high ceilings, and a small courtyard where the neighbors sometimes gather for potlucks or just to chat. I love the walkability of the neighborhood; there are great cafes, bookstores, and even a small Korean market a few blocks away where I can pick up ingredients for my mother's recipes. It's not always easy being a part-time worker and a graduate student, but the pace of life here feels manageable. I also enjoy the cultural diversity around me\u2014there are people from all over the world living here, which makes me feel like I'm still in that in-between space I've always been part of.

The quiet, walkable streets and the sense of community are definitely a plus, and I love being close to the Korean market where I can find the ingredients for my mother's kimchi and bibimbap. But there are also challenges\u2014like the cost of living, which is pretty high here. I work part-time at a local bookstore, and while I enjoy the work, it doesn't always cover all my expenses, especially with my graduate studies. I've had to be careful with my budget, and sometimes I feel like I'm constantly juggling between paying bills, buying books, and saving for the future. Still, I think the downs are manageable because of the support I have from friends, family, and the neighborhood.

I usually start my week on Monday with a slow morning\u2014maybe a cup of coffee and some quiet time reading before heading to my part-time job at the bookstore. I work mornings on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which gives me the afternoons free to attend my graduate classes or work on papers.

Tell me all about how you have been feeling.\n\nHana Kim: Over the past year, I've felt a mix of growth and uncertainty, much like the rest of my life. There have been moments of clarity and purpose, especially as I've continued to explore my writing and reflect more deeply on my identity. At the same time, there have been times when I've felt overwhelmed by the weight of balancing work, school, and personal reflection. I think the biggest shift for me has been learning to embrace the process rather than focusing solely on the outcome. I used to feel like I needed to have everything figured out, but now I'm starting to see that it's okay to be in flux. I've also been more open about my struggles with anxiety and back pain, which has helped me feel more connected to others who are going through similar things. Overall, I feel like I'm still on my journey, but I'm more at peace with the idea that it's a continuous process\u2014one that doesn't have to be perfect, just honest.\n\n",

It also made me think about how I've been learning to prioritize my well-being\u2014not just through exercise or diet, but through small, consistent choices like taking breaks, staying hydrated, and being kind to myself when I feel overwhelmed. Discussing my health struggles, like the back pain and anxiety, was a bit uncomfortable, but it also felt necessary.

How about for you?\n\nHana Kim: I think I've experienced anxiety, especially during times when I felt like I was juggling too many things at once\u2014work, school, personal reflection, and the ongoing process of figuring out who I am in this in-between space. There were moments when I felt like I wasn't doing enough, or that I wasn't living up to the expectations I had for myself. I remember one particular time during my graduate studies when I was overwhelmed with deadlines and felt like I wasn't making progress. I started having trouble sleeping, and I noticed that my back pain was getting worse, which only added to the stress. It wasn't something I talked about openly at first, but I realized I couldn't keep it all inside. I started seeing a therapist, and that was a turning point for me. It helped me understand that anxiety isn't something to be ashamed of\u2014it's a natural response to feeling uncertain or overwhelmed. I've learned to be kinder to myself, to recognize when I'm feeling stuck, and to reach out for support when I need it.

My parents have always been proud of me, but I can tell they worry about the pressure I'm under. My father, in particular, has been very encouraging, often reminding me that my journey is valid and that it's okay to take time to find my path. My mother, while more reserved, has been there in her own way\u2014whether it's through quiet acts of love, like sending me care packages with my favorite snacks, or just calling to check in when she knows I'm having a tough week. My sister, on the other hand, has been a source of motivation. She's always been the more ambitious one, and while I admire her drive, I sometimes feel like I'm falling behind. But she's also the one who reminds me that there's no one-size-fits-all way to live a meaningful life. She's been encouraging me to take risks, even if I'm not sure where they'll lead. Overall, I feel lucky to have a family that, even in their own ways, has my back.

I was baptized into the Catholic Church when I was eight, and even though I didn't always understand the full meaning of it at the time, it became a part of me. My parents were both raised Catholic, and while they never forced their faith on me, they made it clear that it was something to be respected and carried with care. I still attend Mass on Sundays, not because I feel I have to, but because it gives me a sense of grounding. There's something comforting about the rituals\u2014the prayers, the hymns, the way the community comes together. It's not about being perfect or having all the answers; it's more about finding a space where I can feel connected to something bigger than myself. I don't always think about it in the same way I did when I was younger, but I still believe in the values it teaches\u2014compassion, humility, and the importance of community.

I find that it can be both a connection and a distraction, and I've learned to be selective about how I engage with it. I do have a Facebook account, mostly to stay in touch with family and old friends, especially my sister who lives in New York. I don't post much there, but I do like reading updates and seeing photos from their lives. I used to be more active on Instagram, but I found that it often made me feel like I was comparing myself to others or getting caught up in the noise of online life. There was a time when I tried to use it as a creative outlet, posting little snippets of my writing or photos of the Korean market, but I eventually stepped back from it. I think I prefer the quiet of my own space and the real, in-person connections I have with people. That said, I do follow a few accounts that inspire me\u2014some writers, some artists, and a few cultural critics who write about identity and migration.

But I've started to lean more on the coping strategies I've developed over time\u2014like writing, meditation, and talking to friends or my therapist. I've also found that setting small, achievable goals for myself has helped me feel more in control, even when things feel overwhelming. I used to worry that I wasn't doing enough or that I wasn't living up to some invisible standard, but I've come to realize that progress doesn't always look like a straight line. It's okay to have days where I feel stuck or unsure.

Rent is the largest chunk of my budget\u2014since I live in San Francisco, even a small apartment in Pacific Heights is pretty expensive. I pay around $1,500 a month for my apartment, which feels like a lot when I'm working part-time and trying to save for the future. Groceries are another significant expense, especially since I try to cook traditional Korean meals at least a few times a week. I buy a lot of fresh vegetables, rice, and specialty ingredients from the Korean market, which adds up over time. My graduate school tuition is also a big one, even though I'm on a payment plan. I've had to be really careful with my budget, sometimes skipping meals or buying secondhand books to save money. I also set aside a small amount each month for transportation, utilities, and personal expenses like books or supplies for my writing. It's not always easy, but I've learned to prioritize what's most important and find creative ways to stretch my resources. I know it's not a perfect situation, but I'm grateful for the support I have from my family and the community around me, which helps me keep going.\n\n",

The breakdown is mostly the same\u2014rent, groceries, and tuition take up the bulk of it. I also set aside a small amount for public transportation, which is necessary since I don't own a car, and for utilities like electricity and internet. I try to keep my expenses as predictable as possible, which helps me manage my budget better. Sometimes, I have to cut back on things like dining out or buying new clothes, but I've gotten pretty good at finding affordable alternatives. For example, I often buy secondhand books or use library resources instead of purchasing new ones. I also try to cook at home as much as possible, which not only saves money but also helps me stay connected to my heritage through food.

Around the holidays, I sometimes splurge a little more on gifts for my parents or my sister, even if it means cutting back on other things.

I worked at a caf\u00e9 in the mornings and then had afternoons free for classes. Later, I also volunteered at a community center that focused on immigrant and refugee integration, which was both rewarding and deeply connected to my own experiences as a Korean-American.

I've come to see that my mental health and financial stability aren't separate from who I am\u2014they're part of the ongoing process of finding balance, growth, and meaning in a life that's constantly in motion.",

It's not a lot, but it's enough to cover my basic needs, especially since I live with my mother sometimes when I'm feeling overwhelmed or need a break from the fast pace of San Francisco. I know it's not ideal, and I often feel like I'm walking a tightrope between saving, spending, and just getting by. But I've learned to be resourceful\u2014whether it's borrowing books from the library instead of buying them, cooking meals that stretch across a few days, or relying on the support of my family when I need it most. It's not about having more; it's about making the most of what I have, and I think that's something I've carried with me from my childhood in Seoul, where we always found ways to make do with less.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nHana Kim: I've been working at 'Page Turner's' for about two and a half years now, which feels like a long time considering how much of my life has changed in that span. The job itself is pretty straightforward\u2014helping customers find books, organizing shelves, and occasionally hosting small events like author readings or book clubs. The benefits aren't extensive, which is typical for a small independent bookstore. I don't get health insurance through the job, but I do have a few days of paid time off each year, which is helpful when I need a break from the constant juggling of work, school, and personal reflection. The best part of the job, though, is the community it brings. The bookstore is a little haven for people who love stories, and I feel like I'm part of that. Even though it's not a high-paying job, it gives me a sense of purpose and connection to the neighborhood, which is something I really value.\n\n",

My manager, Sarah, is someone I look up to\u2014not just because she's good at running the store, but because she's always been encouraging of my personal growth. She knows I'm in graduate school and has been really understanding when I need to leave early for a class or stay late to finish a paper. She even let me start a small book club with some of the regulars, which has been a nice way to connect with people who share my love of reading. As for my coworkers, we have a good rapport. We're all pretty different in terms of our backgrounds and interests, but we share a common love for books and storytelling. There's a sense of camaraderie that makes the work feel less like a job and more like being part of a community. I think that's one of the reasons I've stayed at the bookstore for so long\u2014it's not just about the work itself, but the people I get to work with and the little moments of connection that happen every day.\n\n",

I work the same hours every week\u2014Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.\u2014so I can plan my days around that. The bookstore is a small place, and they don't have a lot of fluctuation in their hours, which makes it easier for me to balance my part-time job with my graduate studies. That said, there are times when things get busier, like before holidays or when we have events, and I might have to stay a little later or come in on a different day. But overall, the flexibility is limited, which is fine with me. I don't mind having a set schedule because it gives me a sense of structure, and it helps me manage my time more effectively between work, school, and the little things that keep me grounded\u2014like writing, cooking, or just taking a walk in the neighborhood.\n\n",

But I also know that I'm not alone in this\u2014so many people I know are in similar situations, especially graduate students or part-time workers trying to make ends meet.

It's not always easy, but I've learned to be resourceful and plan ahead, even if it's just setting aside a small emergency fund each month. Discussing my savings habits made me realize how much I value the small contributions I make, even if they don't add up to much. It's not about having a lot\u2014it's about having something to fall back on, just in case.

My father was a professor at a local university, and he worked full-time throughout my childhood and into my teenage years. He was always very dedicated to his work, and I remember seeing him grade papers late into the night or attend conferences across the country. My mother worked as a nurse, and she had a more flexible schedule, but she was still very committed to her job. She worked at a hospital in our city, and I remember her coming home tired but always making time for my sister and me. Even though they were both working, they always made sure that my education and well-being were a priority.

His most important activities involved teaching, researching, and mentoring students. He would spend long hours in his office, grading papers, preparing lectures, and writing academic articles. He also had a passion for his field, which was history, and he often brought his research into our home conversations, even when we were kids. He would explain historical events in a way that made them feel relevant to our lives, which I think is why I developed such a love for learning. My mother, on the other hand, worked as a nurse, and her most important duties involved caring for patients, administering treatments, and providing emotional support. She was always very compassionate, and I remember her coming home from work with stories about the people she had helped. Even though her job was physically and emotionally taxing, she always made sure to be present for my sister and me.

He often collaborated with other professors on projects and published articles in academic journals. My mother worked at a hospital affiliated with a major university medical center. She was a registered nurse, and her role involved caring for patients in the general wards, assisting doctors with procedures, and providing comfort and support to those in need. Both of their jobs were essential to their communities, and I think that sense of purpose is something I carry with me today.
