My own appreciation for beauty often comes from emotional or personal connections, like the way my mother's cooking makes me feel at home, or the quiet, reflective atmosphere of Pacific Heights. While there are some objective elements to beauty (like symmetry), I think the experience of beauty is deeply personal and varies depending on who is perceiving it."

While humans might see their own development as an improvement, dinosaurs existed in a world that was vastly different and ultimately led to their extinction. This aligns more with the idea that history is not a linear path of improvement but rather a series of random, often chaotic events. Dinosaurs are a reminder that not all evolutionary paths lead to the present, and many are lost to time. This makes me lean more toward the 'history is random' side of the spectrum."

While it is not inherently entertaining, it also isn’t typically considered annoying unless it is malfunctioning or overly sensitive. In my experience, smoke detectors are generally neutral—functional and necessary, but not something that would be described as either annoying or entertaining. However, if it were to be placed on the spectrum, I would lean slightly toward the annoying side because of the potential for false alarms or the loud sound it makes, which can be jarring, especially at night or in quiet environments."

It suggests a moment of quiet reflection in a new place, which could be associated with wanderlust, but the mention of 'new city' also carries a subtle undertone of displacement. My own experiences of moving between cultures and feeling caught between Seoul and the U.S. make me sensitive to the tension between exploring new places and missing the familiarity of home.
