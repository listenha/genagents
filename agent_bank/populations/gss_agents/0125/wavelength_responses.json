My own experiences with art, nature, and relationships have shown me that beauty is often tied to meaning, connection, and emotion, which are inherently subjective. However, I acknowledge that some aspects of beauty, like symmetry or harmony, can be universally recognized.

Their existence is a product of natural processes and random evolutionary events, and their extinction was also a result of unpredictable factors, such as an asteroid impact. This aligns more with the idea that history is random rather than a steady march toward improvement. While dinosaurs may have contributed to the development of ecosystems that eventually supported human life, their story itself is more about randomness and natural selection than about progress."

When it's done in moderation, with friends, and in a socially appropriate setting, it can feel cool and even enjoyable. However, when it's associated with overindulgence, peer pressure, or situations where it leads to embarrassment, it can definitely feel cringe.

While there is a sense of being in a new city, which could lean toward wanderlust, the mention of candlelight often evokes a sense of comfort, solitude, or longing. Given my own experiences of feeling both drawn to new places and at times missing the comfort of home, I believe this clue carries more of a homesick sentiment.

My own experience with math was shaped by a curriculum that gradually introduced complexity, and I've always appreciated the depth and creativity involved in higher-level mathematics.

My experiences with life's unpredictability, from health challenges to financial fluctuations, have shown me that while there is some randomness, there are also patterns and causes.

While there may be some objective elements (like symmetry or natural patterns), the feeling of beauty is deeply tied to personal emotions, memories, and cultural background.

For example, I find the natural landscapes of Boulder beautiful, but I know others may not share that view. At the same time, I recognize that there are some universally admired traits, like the symmetry in a sunset or the structure of a well-designed building, which suggests a middle ground. However, I lean more toward the subjective side because beauty is ultimately about how it makes a person feel."
