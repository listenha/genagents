Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nKenya Robinson: Well, I was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama, in a tight-knit neighborhood where everyone knew each other. My parents both worked hard, and while they didn't have a lot of money, they always made sure I had the basics and a good education. I remember walking to school every day with my younger brother, and we'd pass by the same old trees and the same folks who'd wave at us. I was a pretty quiet kid, more interested in books and art than sports or games. My mom used to say I had a way with words, and I guess that's why I ended up going into writing after college. I went to a state school, got my bachelor's in English, and then I just kind of fell into a job at a local publishing house. It's not glamorous, but it's steady, and I like the work. I've never been married, and I don't really see myself getting married anytime soon. I've got a few close friends, and I like to keep things simple. Life hasn't been too dramatic, but I've always tried to make the most of what I've got.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nKenya Robinson: Hmm, thinking back, there was one moment that really shaped my path. I was about 19, just starting my sophomore year in college. I had a choice to either stay close to home and take a job at a local community college to help my parents out financially, or I could take a risk and apply for a scholarship to study at a more prestigious university out of state. I was torn because I didn't want to leave my family, especially after my brother had just started high school. But I also knew that if I didn't push myself, I might never find out what I was truly capable of. In the end, I applied for the scholarship, got accepted, and moved to Ohio. That decision was tough, but it opened up a whole new world for me. I met people I never would have met otherwise, and I was exposed to different ideas and perspectives that really helped me grow. It also made me more confident in my own voice, which is why I ended up pursuing writing. I don't think I would be where I am today if I hadn't made that choice.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nKenya Robinson: I think, in that moment, it was a conscious choice, but it didn't feel like one at the time. I remember sitting in my parents' living room, staring at the scholarship letter, and feeling like I was standing on the edge of something I couldn't quite see. I knew I wanted more for myself, but I also felt guilty about leaving my family behind. It wasn't just about the scholarship\u2014it was about proving to myself that I could take a risk and still come out the other side. I think that's what made it a real choice, even if it felt like it just happened. I had to weigh my fears against my hopes, and in the end, I chose hope.\n\n",

My high school English teacher, Ms. Carter, was one of those people who saw potential in me before I even did. She encouraged me to apply for that scholarship and even wrote a strong letter of recommendation for me. Without her support, I don't know if I would have had the confidence to take that step. Also, the local community center had a mentorship program that I participated in, and the people there helped me think through what I really wanted out of life. It wasn't just about the scholarship\u2014it was about having people who believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. I think that's why I've always tried to pay it forward, even in small ways, like mentoring high school students who are thinking about college.\n\n",

My parents are both retired now, and they live just a few blocks away from me in Birmingham. We still see each other often, and I make it a point to visit them at least once a week. My brother is in his late twenties now, and he's working as a mechanic. He's got his own family now\u2014two kids, a daughter and a son. I love being around my niece and nephew; they keep me on my toes, but I also get to see the kind of person I might have become if I had stayed closer to home. I think about that sometimes, but I also know that the path I took has given me a different kind of strength. I'm not sure if I'll ever have a partner or children of my own, but I'm content with the life I've built so far. I've got my family, my work, and a few good friends who keep me grounded.\n\n",

We're all pretty close, even though we've all taken different paths in life. My parents are both pretty traditional, but they've always been supportive of my choices, even when they didn't fully understand them. My dad used to say that as long as I was happy and doing something that made me proud, he was proud of me too. My mom, on the other hand, has always been the one who pushed me to dream bigger. She didn't have the chance to go to college, so she always encouraged me to take every opportunity I could get. I think that's why I ended up in publishing\u2014because she always believed in the power of stories and words. As for my brother, he's more of a hands-on kind of guy, but we get along really well. He's always been my biggest supporter, even when I was the one who left home to chase my dreams. I think that's why I feel so connected to my roots, even though I've been living in Birmingham my whole life and never really left.

Are there people outside of your family who are important to you?\n\nKenya Robinson: Outside of my family, I have a few close friends who have been with me through thick and thin. One of them is Marcus, who I met in college. He's a graphic designer, and we've been friends for over 15 years now. We used to hang out all the time, working on creative projects together, and even though we're both busy with our own lives now, we still make time for each other. Then there's Tiffany, who works in marketing, and we've been best friends since high school. She's the one who always keeps me laughing and reminds me not to take life too seriously. I also have a couple of coworkers at the publishing house who I consider friends\u2014people like Jordan, who's been a mentor to me in the industry, and Lena, who's like a sister to me. We all support each other in different ways, whether it's through advice, encouragement, or just a good cup of coffee and a long conversation.

It's a pretty diverse area, with people from all walks of life, and I like that about it. There's a community garden on the corner that my neighbors and I help maintain, and it's become a little gathering spot for people to chat, share food, or just enjoy the greenery. I live in a two-bedroom apartment on the second floor of a building that's been renovated but still has that old Southern charm. My apartment is cozy, with lots of bookshelves and plants\u2014things I've collected over the years. I love that I can walk to everything: the local library, a few cafes, and even a small bookstore that's been around for decades. It's not the most upscale part of the city, but it feels like home. There's a sense of community here that I really appreciate, and I think that's why I've never felt the need to move away, even though I've had opportunities to do so.

I've never had any real issues with crime, and I think that's partly because of the community spirit. We've got block parties, neighborhood watch meetings, and even a local group that organizes clean-up days. I remember one time when a stranger left their car running in the driveway, and someone from next door came out to check on them. It's those little moments that make me feel like I'm part of something real and caring. I don't think I'd ever want to live somewhere that felt impersonal or unsafe.

The biggest upside is the community\u2014there's a real sense of belonging that I don't think I'd find in a bigger city. I love being able to walk to the library, grab coffee at the corner caf\u00e9, or just sit on my porch and watch the world go by. But it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes, the pace of life here can feel a little slow, and I've had to learn to be patient with myself when I want more excitement or new opportunities.

I also make sure to eat pretty well, mostly sticking to home-cooked meals and avoiding too much processed food. I've been dealing with some mild back pain lately, probably from sitting at a desk for so long, but I've started stretching more and using a standing desk at work to help with that.

I also find that cooking at home is easier than I used to think, especially now that I've gotten into experimenting with recipes from different cuisines. It's satisfying and keeps me from relying too much on takeout. But the hard part is consistency, especially when it comes to exercise. I know I should be more active, but sometimes the day gets busy, and I end up skipping my workouts or just doing the bare minimum. I also struggle with staying on top of my mental health when life feels overwhelming. I've learned that it's not about being perfect\u2014it's about showing up for myself, even on the days when I don't feel like it.

About a year ago, I started experiencing some persistent lower back pain, which I initially dismissed as just sitting too long at my desk. But after a few months of it getting worse, I finally made an appointment with a physical therapist. Turns out, it was a combination of poor posture and muscle strain from my work routine. The therapist helped me with some stretches and exercises, and I've been using a standing desk more often since then, which has made a big difference. I also had a minor flare-up of my seasonal allergies last spring, which made me more aware of how important it is to stay on top of my health, even with the small things. It's funny, but these little issues have actually been a wake-up call for me to be more intentional about my habits\u2014like making sure I take breaks during the day, staying hydrated, and not skipping my evening walks.

How about you?\n\nKenya Robinson: Honestly, my health issues haven't really gotten in the way of my work or daily life, but they've made me more aware of how important it is to take care of myself. The back pain did slow me down a bit at first, especially when I was sitting for long periods, but once I started making adjustments\u2014like using the standing desk and stretching more\u2014it became manageable. I didn't have to miss work or make any big changes to my routine, which I'm grateful for. I think the biggest thing is that it made me more intentional about my habits. I used to think I could just power through without taking care of myself, but now I realize that small changes can have a big impact.

There's been a sense of quiet stability in my life, which I think is something I've been working toward for a while. I've been more intentional about my time, not just with work, but with my family, my friends, and even with myself. I've started setting small goals for the year\u2014like reading more books, getting back into writing short stories, and even trying to write a personal essay about my journey. It's been challenging at times, especially when I feel like I'm not making progress fast enough, but I've learned to be kinder to myself and celebrate the small wins. I also feel more connected to my community than ever before. Volunteering at the community center has become more meaningful to me, and I've started mentoring a few high school students who are thinking about college. It's amazing how much I've learned from them, too\u2014they remind me of what it's like to be young and full of possibilities.

There were a few years when I questioned whether I was making the most of my opportunities or if I was just going through the motions. But I've learned to recognize those feelings and not let them define me. I've started talking to a therapist a few times a month, which has been really helpful.

It's been nice to see him find joy in something new, and I've been helping him with the marketing side of it. My mom has been more involved with our neighborhood's community center, especially with the literacy programs. She's always believed in the power of education, and it's heartwarming to see her giving back in a way that aligns with her values. As for my brother and his family, they've been going through their own changes too. My niece, Aisha, is starting to show more interest in writing, and she's been asking me for advice on how to get started. It's amazing how much she's grown, and I can see her becoming the kind of person I always wanted to be.

I used to post a few things back in college, mostly photos of my work or book recommendations, but over time, I started to feel like I was comparing myself to others or getting caught up in things that didn't really matter.

When I'm going through something, I tend to reach out to them directly, have a real conversation, and get the kind of support that feels genuine. I think social media can be a double-edged sword.

I used to worry a lot about not being ambitious enough or not making the most of my opportunities, but I've come to realize that my life doesn't need to be defined by big, dramatic moments.

Rent is the biggest chunk, as I mentioned, and then groceries come in a close second. I try to keep things simple\u2014buying in bulk when I can, cooking at home, and avoiding unnecessary expenses.

It's interesting how reducing stress hasn't come from big life changes, but from small, intentional habits like journaling and spending time with loved ones. I've also come to appreciate how my financial situation, while not extravagant, gives me the freedom to live a life that feels meaningful and grounded. I used to worry about not having enough or not being ambitious enough, but now I see that contentment comes from knowing what truly matters\u2014family, health, and the simple joys of everyday life. It's a reminder that I don't need to chase perfection or dramatic moments to feel fulfilled. I'm learning to find peace in the quiet, the routine, and the people who support me every day.",

That comes from my full-time job at the publishing house, which pays a steady salary, and the freelance writing I do on the side. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover my expenses and even allow me to set aside a little for savings. I've always believed that financial stability doesn't come from having more than you need, but from knowing exactly what you need and being able to provide it. I'm grateful for the work I do and the flexibility it gives me. It's not about chasing wealth\u2014it's about finding contentment in what I have and making sure I can support the people I care about, whether that's my family, my friends, or even the community I'm part of. I think that's what makes life meaningful for me: not the numbers on a paycheck, but the ability to live with purpose and peace.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nKenya Robinson: I've been at my current job at the publishing house for about six years now, and it's been a journey. When I first started, I was just out of college, still figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I remember feeling a bit lost, like I was just going through the motions. But over time, I've grown into the role and found a real sense of purpose in it. The benefits of the job are pretty standard\u2014health insurance, paid time off, and a few holidays. I also get a few days of sick leave, which has been helpful, especially when I've had to deal with my back pain or seasonal allergies. I think the best part of the job, though, is the flexibility. I can usually work from home a couple of days a week if I need to, and the company is pretty supportive of employees who want to balance work with personal life. I've also had the chance to work on some really meaningful projects\u2014books that have touched people, stories that have made a difference. It's not always easy, but I feel lucky to be in a place where I can do work that matters, even if it's not always in the spotlight.\n\n",

I have a manager, Ms. Delgado, who's been with the company for a while and has a lot of experience. She's fair, supportive, and doesn't micromanage, which I really appreciate. I think we have a mutual respect\u2014she knows I'm reliable and I know she's someone I can trust to give me honest feedback. As for my coworkers, I've been lucky to work with a team that's both professional and friendly. There's Jordan, who I mentioned earlier, and he's been a mentor to me in the industry. He's always willing to share his knowledge and help me grow. Then there's Lena, who's like a sister to me\u2014she's the one who keeps the office light and fun, and I don't know what I'd do without her. We all have our own quirks, but we get along well and support each other through the ups and downs of the job. I think that's what makes this workplace feel like a real community, even if it's just for eight hours a day.\n\n",

I also have the option to adjust my hours a bit if I need to, as long as I'm meeting my deadlines.

I don't need a lot to be happy\u2014I have my family, my work, and the little things that make life feel full. I've learned to be grateful for what I have instead of always chasing more.

My mom, on the other hand, was a school administrator at the middle school I attended. Her days were filled with meetings, scheduling, and making sure that the school ran like a well-oiled machine.

It was a tough job\u2014long hours, hot environment, and the kind of work that required you to be on your feet all day.

My mom worked for the Birmingham Public Schools system, and she was the assistant principal at the middle school I attended. Her job involved a lot of behind-the-scenes work\u2014scheduling, budgeting, and making sure that the school stayed compliant with state regulations. But she also had to handle the more visible parts of the job, like dealing with parent-teacher conferences, student discipline, and organizing school events. I remember her telling me once that being an administrator wasn't just about managing people\u2014it was about managing the whole ecosystem of a school, and that meant being ready for anything, from a sudden budget cut to a student in crisis. Both of them worked for businesses that were rooted in the community, and I think that's why they always emphasized the importance of giving back, even when times were tough.\n\n",
