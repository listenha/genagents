Based on my experiences, most horror movies fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum—they aim to scare but not necessarily to the point of being overwhelming. I’ve seen some that were genuinely frightening, but I’ve also seen others that were more about suspense and atmosphere than outright terror. I’ve never found a horror movie so boring that it left me feeling 'bored to death,' but I also know that some people might find certain horror movies too intense. Overall, I think horror movies are more likely to fall closer to the 'scared to death' end of the spectrum, but not at the extreme."

Based on my experiences and values, I see drinking as something that can be both cool and cringe depending on the situation, but it's not inherently one or the other.

While it hints at being in a new city, the imagery of candlelight suggests warmth, intimacy, and a personal, reflective mood. This feels more aligned with a sense of comfort and emotional grounding rather than a strong desire to explore or wander. It doesn’t convey a feeling of longing for home, but rather a moment of calm and connection in a new place. My own experiences with finding comfort in familiar routines and valuing the connections I have in my current neighborhood make me lean more toward the 'homesickness' end of the spectrum, but not to the extreme.

While there are some objective elements (like light, color, or form), the perception of beauty is deeply influenced by personal values, emotions, and cultural context. My own experiences with art, relationships, and the world around me have shown me that what one person finds beautiful, another may not. For example, I find the quiet moments in life—like a Sunday afternoon with family or a walk in the neighborhood—beautiful, but these are deeply personal and not universally recognized as beautiful. However, I also acknowledge that there are some widely accepted standards of beauty, such as in nature or architecture, which lean toward the objective side. Still, the dominant factor for me is the personal, emotional connection to what is considered beautiful."
