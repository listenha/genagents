She has reflected on her ability to manage stress through routines like journaling, walking, and spending time with loved ones.

However, she also emphasizes that she has learned to manage these feelings through self-compassion, journaling, and support from her community. She does not describe herself as someone who gets nervous easily, but rather as someone who has learned to cope with occasional anxiety. This suggests she would not rate herself as a 5, but also does not seem to be entirely free of nervousness, so a middle range might be more accurate.",
