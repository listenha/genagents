She has reflected on her ability to manage stress through routines like journaling, walking, and spending time with loved ones.

However, she also emphasizes that she has learned to manage these feelings through self-compassion, journaling, and support from her community. She does not describe herself as someone who gets nervous easily, but rather as someone who has learned to cope with occasional anxiety. This suggests she would not rate herself as a 5, but also does not seem to be entirely free of nervousness, so a middle range might be more accurate.",

            "REI_1": "Kenya Robinson demonstrates a thoughtful and grounded approach to life, but she does not emphasize problem-solving as a core strength. She reflects on her life with a focus on relationships, routine, and community, rather than on overcoming complex challenges. While she has made thoughtful decisions, such as choosing to leave home for college, she does not frame these as complex problem-solving feats. Instead, she credits support from others and her own sense of purpose. This suggests a moderate to low confidence in her ability to solve complicated problems, aligning more with the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_2": "Kenya Robinson describes herself as thoughtful, grounded, and reflective, but she does not mention any specific struggles or strengths with logical analysis.

She doesn't seem to focus on logical analysis as a strength or weakness.
