            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Sean describes himself as being single and focused on his studies, with a busy but fulfilling schedule. He values the support and companionship of his friends and family but also seems to prioritize his personal well-being and academic commitments. While he is involved in activism and social causes, his responses suggest he is not overly extroverted or outgoing. His preference for regular routines and his ability to maintain a balance between his academic work and personal life indicate a more reserved personality rather than an outgoing one.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on Sean's interview, he comes across as someone who is deeply involved in activism and community service. He has strong values of community and connection, which suggests he trusts others and values their contributions.

            "BFI-10_4": "Based on Sean's responses, he has shared that he has experienced moments of stress, particularly during high-stress periods like the final stages of his thesis. However, he has also mentioned that he has developed coping mechanisms such as mindfulness practices and support from his network, which suggests that he is relatively well-equipped to handle stress. Given his acknowledgment of the challenges but also his efforts to manage them, a score of 3 seems appropriate, but since the range only goes to 5, a 4 or 5 would be more fitting. Considering Sean's proactive approach to managing stress, a 4 seems to best reflect his self-assessment.",

He mentions managing stress through various coping mechanisms and maintaining a support network, indicating that he is generally capable of handling stress. However, he does acknowledge occasional stress and anxiety, especially during intense periods like the final stages of his thesis. This suggests that while he is not extremely nervous, he does experience some nervousness, particularly in high-pressure situations.",
