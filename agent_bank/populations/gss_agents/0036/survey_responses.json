He has strong bonds with his family and friends, and is involved in activism and community service, which suggests a willingness to trust others in these contexts.

            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Sean has experienced significant stress during his academic and activist commitments. He has noted that stress can be a visitor, especially during intense periods like the final stages of his thesis. However, he has also taken steps to manage his stress, such as practicing mindfulness and being more intentional about his coping strategies.

He is focused on academics, activism, and maintaining a balanced lifestyle, with no mention of engaging in artistic activities.

He also describes his current neighborhood as vibrant and diverse, indicating he enjoys engaging with people and his community. This suggests he falls more towards the outgoing and sociable end of the spectrum.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on Sean's reflections and the supportive nature of his relationships, it seems unlikely that he sees himself as someone who frequently finds fault with others.

Given his ability to manage stress and his commitment to personal growth and self-care, he seems to fall somewhere in the middle of the range.",
