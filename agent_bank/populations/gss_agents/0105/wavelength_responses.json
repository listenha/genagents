Given that horror movies are typically meant to be scary, I would place this clue closer to the 'scared to death' end of the spectrum, but not at the extreme.

However, I also recognize that drinking can be cringe if it's done irresponsibly, in public, or in a way that causes harm.

Based on my experience, a properly functioning smoke detector is neutral—it does its job without being intrusive or engaging. It is neither annoying nor entertaining, but it is necessary.

It could imply a sense of loneliness or longing, which leans more toward homesickness. However, it could also be interpreted as a moment of appreciation for the beauty of a new city, which might lean toward wanderlust. Given my own experiences of feeling both homesick and curious about new places, I think this clue is more aligned with homesickness.

While it is not overly zesty or bold in flavor, it does have a noticeable level of carbonation and a distinct, slightly acidic taste that sets it apart from bland beverages. However, it lacks the complexity or intensity of flavor that would place it on the 'zesty' end of the spectrum.

I’ve seen how people can find beauty in the same thing for different reasons, and how it can be deeply personal. That said, there are some universally recognized forms of beauty, like a sunset or a well-crafted piece of art, which suggests a blend of both objective and subjective elements. Still, the core of what makes something beautiful is often tied to the observer’s feelings and values."
