Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nEthan Schmehl: Well, I was born in Chicago, just a few blocks away from where I live now, actually. Growing up in the East North Central region, I remember the neighborhood was pretty tight-knit, though not without its challenges. My parents were both working hard to make ends meet, and while they didn't have a lot of money, they always made sure I had the basics and a good education. My father had a graduate degree in engineering, and my mother has a bachelor's in education. She worked part-time as a teacher's aide, which I think helped her stay connected to the school system. I was raised in a Catholic household, and even though I wasn't super religious as a kid, I still found comfort in the traditions and community events we attended. I went to public school, and while my family's income was below average, both of my parents pushed me to do well in school. I ended up getting a bachelor's degree in social work, which I always felt was a way to give back to the community. I got married in my early 30s, and I've been working full-time as a case manager at a local nonprofit ever since. Life hasn't been easy, but I've always tried to stay positive and focused on helping others.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nEthan Schmehl: There was definitely a crossroads moment for me, and it came right after I graduated from college. I had been working part-time while I was in school, mostly at a community center that served low-income families. I remember one particular day, I was helping a single mother and her two kids who were struggling with food insecurity. I saw how exhausted she was, how she was trying her best but just barely keeping her head above water. That experience really hit me hard, and I realized I wanted to dedicate my career to helping people like her. I had a job offer from a corporate firm that paid well, but it was in a different field\u2014finance. I almost took it because the money was tempting, especially with my family's financial background. But I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being pulled in the wrong direction. I talked it over with my wife-to-be, who was also working in a nonprofit, and she encouraged me to follow my heart. In the end, I chose the social work path, and I've never regretted it. That decision shaped who I am today\u2014someone who values community, service, and making a difference, even if it doesn't always come with a big paycheck.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nEthan Schmehl: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made lightly. It felt like a weight on my chest for weeks, going back and forth between the security of the corporate job and the purpose I felt in social work. I remember sitting at my parents' kitchen table one night, staring at the job offer letter, and just feeling like something inside me was screaming, 'This isn't who you are.' I knew I wanted to be someone who stood up for people who couldn't stand up for themselves. It wasn't just about money\u2014it was about meaning. I didn't want to look back years from now and wonder what might have been, but I also didn't want to live a life that didn't align with my values. In the end, I chose the path that felt true to who I was, even if it meant fewer luxuries and more long hours. I think that decision was the moment I truly became the person I am today.\n\n",

My wife was definitely that person for me\u2014she didn't push me toward either choice, but she listened and reminded me of what really mattered to me. I also think a mentor in the social work field could have helped me see the long-term impact of my decision. At the time, I was pretty young and still figuring out who I wanted to be, so having someone with more experience to guide me would have given me more confidence. I remember talking to a professor from my undergrad who had worked in nonprofit organizations, and he shared some of his own struggles with choosing purpose over paycheck. That conversation stuck with me, and it reinforced the idea that I didn't have to choose the easiest path to be successful. In the end, I think it was a combination of my own values, the support from my wife, and a few key people who believed in what I wanted to do that helped me make the right choice.\n\n",

Do you have a partner, or children?\n\nEthan Schmehl: Yes, I'm married to my wife, Claire, and we have two children\u2014a daughter named Lily, who's six, and a son, Max, who's four. Claire and I met in college, actually, during a group project for a sociology class. She was studying public health, and I was in social work, so we had a lot in common in terms of our interests and values. We got married right after I graduated, and we've been through a lot together\u2014raising kids, managing the financial challenges of working in the nonprofit sector, and just trying to make sure our kids grow up in a stable, loving environment. Claire works part-time as a community health coordinator, which allows her to be more present for the kids, and I handle the full-time case manager role. It's not always easy, but we've built a life that's meaningful to both of us. Our kids are pretty active, and we try to make sure they understand the importance of helping others, even at a young age. We volunteer at a local food pantry on weekends, and I think that's something that's already shaping their worldview.\n\n",

My father, Hans, is a civil engineer, and he's always had a strong work ethic. Even though he's retired now, he still volunteers with local infrastructure projects, which I think is a great way for him to stay connected to his community. My mother, Maria, is a former teacher's aide and has always been passionate about education. She's the one who encouraged me to pursue higher education, even when we were struggling financially. Our relationship has always been close, and even though we don't see each other as often as I'd like due to my job, I know I can always count on them for advice and support. My sister, Anna, lives in Milwaukee and works as a nurse. We talk regularly, and she's been a huge source of encouragement for me, especially as a parent. She's the one who always reminds me that it's okay to ask for help, and that's something I try to pass on to my kids as well.\n\n",

One of them is Marcus, a fellow case manager at the nonprofit I work for. We've been friends for almost a decade now, and he's been through a lot with me\u2014whether it's late-night shifts, tough cases, or just trying to balance work and family life. He's one of the few people I can really be myself around, and he's always had my back. Then there's my mentor, Linda, who started out in social work just like I did. She's been a huge influence on me, not just professionally but personally. She taught me the importance of patience, empathy, and resilience. I still reach out to her when I'm struggling with a tough situation or just need someone to talk to. And of course, there are the people I work with at the food pantry on weekends\u2014some of them are volunteers, others are clients. I've formed some really meaningful connections with them, and I think those relationships have helped me stay grounded in why I do what I do.

It's a mix of old and new\u2014some of the older buildings have been around for decades, while there are also newer developments popping up. The area has a strong sense of community, and I really appreciate that. There are a lot of families here, like me, trying to make ends meet but still finding ways to support each other. The local park is a big part of our neighborhood life; it's where we have block parties, where the kids play, and where I sometimes take my kids to read or just sit and watch the world go by. There's also a community center nearby that offers free programs for kids and adults, which I think is really important for people who might not have access to other resources. I've seen a lot of changes in the area over the years\u2014some for the better, some not so much\u2014but I still feel connected to this place. It's where I started, and it's where I want my kids to grow up, even if it's not perfect. There's a lot of resilience here, and I think that's something I want my children to learn from.\n\n",

People look out for each other, and there's a kind of unspoken understanding that we're all in this together. I've seen neighbors help each other during tough times\u2014whether it's fixing a broken fence, watching out for kids while someone's at work, or just offering a friendly word when things feel heavy. That kind of support makes me feel secure, even if the area isn't without its challenges.

Tell me about what it\u2019s been like for you living here.\n\nEthan Schmehl: Living here has had its ups and downs, just like anywhere else. On the upside, there's a real sense of community that I think is rare in bigger cities. People know each other, they look out for each other, and there's a shared understanding that life isn't always easy, but we can support one another through it. I love that my kids can ride their bikes around the block without me constantly worrying about traffic or strangers. The local park is a big part of our routine, and it's amazing to see how many families use it\u2014some for sports, others just to sit and chat. But of course, there are challenges too. The cost of living here has gone up, and even with both of us working, it's tight sometimes. There are also issues with crime in certain parts of the neighborhood, which is something I try to shield my kids from as much as possible. Still, I believe in this place. It's where I grew up, where I found my purpose, and where I want my kids to grow up too. I think the key is staying involved, staying connected, and not letting the struggles define the whole experience.

My job as a case manager is pretty demanding\u2014some days I'm meeting with clients, others I'm coordinating with other agencies or attending meetings. Mondays are usually the busiest because that's when we review the week's caseload and plan out our priorities. I work from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., though I often stay late a few times a week, especially if there's something urgent that needs attention. On the weekends, I try to balance work with family time. We usually go to the park, do some errands, or have a quiet evening at home. Claire and I also volunteer at the food pantry on Saturdays, which is something we both look forward to\u2014it's a chance to give back and connect with the community in a different way.

The work can be emotionally draining at times, but it's also incredibly rewarding. I've had clients who have gone from being homeless to finding stable housing, or who have been able to get back on their feet after a difficult period. Those moments remind me why I chose this path.

They have a morning routine that includes brushing their teeth, getting dressed, and having breakfast together.

I used to be pretty active as a kid, playing soccer and basketball with friends, but as I got older and started working full-time, I found it harder to keep up with that kind of routine. I do have a few health issues I've had to manage\u2014mainly chronic lower back pain from years of sitting at a desk and lifting clients during home visits. I see a chiropractor every few months, and I've also started doing some physical therapy exercises at home to help with the stiffness. I also have high blood pressure, which I keep under control with a combination of diet, exercise, and medication. I try to eat as healthy as I can, though it's not always easy with the budget we have. We mostly stick to whole foods, cook at home, and limit processed snacks.

It gives me a sense of control and a moment to breathe before the chaos of the day starts. Also, knowing that my health directly affects my ability to be there for my family is a strong motivator.

The most notable was a flare-up of my chronic lower back pain, which got so bad that I had to take a few days off work and see a specialist.

I started seeing a physical therapist more regularly and made a point to incorporate more stretching and strengthening exercises into my routine. It's been a slow process, but I've noticed some improvement. I also had a minor surgery last year to address the disc issue, and while it was scary, it's helped me manage the pain much better. On top of that, my blood pressure has been a bit more unstable lately, probably due to the stress of work and family life. I've had to be more diligent with my medication and diet, which hasn't always been easy, but I'm trying my best. It's been a tough couple of years, but I'm learning that taking care of my health is just as important as the work I do for others.\n\n",

There were a few weeks after my surgery when I was on pain medication and couldn't keep up with the long hours or the physical demands of visiting clients. I had to rely more on Claire to help with the kids and the household, which was humbling but also a reminder of how important it is to ask for help when you need it. I remember one day when I was struggling to get out of bed, and I just sat there thinking about how I used to be so sure I could handle everything on my own. It was a hard lesson, but it taught me that taking care of myself isn't a weakness\u2014it's a responsibility, especially when I have people depending on me. I've had to adjust my work schedule a bit, like taking shorter walks or doing more desk-based tasks when I'm not feeling up to it. It's not ideal, but I've found ways to adapt, and I'm grateful that my team at work has been understanding.

I've been able to take more time to focus on my health, which has been a real blessing. I've also seen some of the clients I've worked with make real progress, which is incredibly rewarding. But there have also been moments of frustration and exhaustion. The cost of living has gone up again, and even with both of us working, it's been harder to make ends meet. I've had to make some tough choices about what we can and can't afford, which isn't easy when you're trying to raise kids and keep a roof over your head. I also feel like I'm constantly walking a tightrope between being present for my family and being there for the people I serve. Some days, I feel like I'm doing okay, and other days, I feel like I'm just barely holding it all together.

There are days when the weight of everything\u2014work, family, the financial strain\u2014it all just feels too much. I used to try to push through it, thinking that if I just kept going, it would pass. But I've learned that ignoring it doesn't make it go away. I've started seeing a therapist, which has been really helpful. It's not always easy to open up, especially with the stigma that still surrounds mental health, but I've found that talking through my feelings has made a big difference. I also try to practice self-compassion now, reminding myself that it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes.

My parents always emphasized the importance of faith, not just as a set of beliefs but as a way of living\u2014through acts of kindness, compassion, and service to others. Even though I didn't always attend church regularly as a kid, the values instilled in me through religious teachings have stayed with me. I still find comfort in the rituals, like attending Mass on Sundays or celebrating holidays with my family, and I believe that spirituality helps me stay grounded, especially during tough times. It's not about being perfect or following every rule, but more about the sense of community and the reminder that I'm part of something bigger than myself. I think that's why I'm drawn to social work\u2014it feels like a natural extension of the values I was raised with. That said, I'm not rigid about it.

It's not that I dislike it, but I've found that it can be more of a distraction than a connection for me. I used to follow some local community pages and a few social justice advocates, but over time, I realized I was spending more time scrolling than actually engaging. I think part of it is that my work and family life already keep me pretty busy, and I want to make sure the time I have is spent meaningfully. That said, I do use Facebook occasionally to stay in touch with family and old friends, especially those who live far away like my sister in Milwaukee. I also follow a few local nonprofits that do similar work to what I do, just to stay informed about what's happening in the community.

Another thing that's helped is setting small, achievable goals for myself, whether it's getting a full night's sleep or taking a walk with the kids. I've also learned to be more open with Claire about how I'm feeling, which has strengthened our connection and made it easier to support each other.

We live in a two-bedroom apartment, and while it's not the most expensive place in the neighborhood, it's still a chunk of our budget\u2014about $1,200 a month. Groceries are another big one, especially since we try to eat healthy and cook at home as much as possible. With two kids, it's not always easy to stretch the budget, but we've gotten pretty good at meal planning and buying in bulk when we can. Car payments are also a significant expense\u2014Claire and I both need our cars for work, and we're still paying off the loans. We also have some insurance costs, including health insurance for the family, which is another fixed expense. On top of that, there are the occasional unexpected costs, like fixing a broken appliance or replacing a tire. It's a tight balance, but we've learned to prioritize what's essential and cut back on things we can live without. I think the hardest part is knowing that even with both of us working, we're always just a few missed paychecks away from needing to make some tough choices.

The majority of that goes to rent, groceries, and car payments, as I mentioned earlier. We also have about $400 set aside for utilities\u2014electricity, water, and internet\u2014which can fluctuate depending on the season. Childcare is another big expense, especially since Claire works part-time and we need someone to watch the kids when we're both at work or volunteering. We've been trying to keep that cost down by using a local co-op for shared childcare, which has been a bit more affordable than traditional daycare. We also have a small amount allocated for personal expenses, like clothing, school supplies, and occasional outings. It's not a lot, but we've learned to be really careful with our money and prioritize what's most important. I think the biggest thing is that we're always looking for ways to stretch our budget without sacrificing the basics, and we're pretty good at finding community resources or discounts when we can.\n\n",

Rent is one of our biggest fixed costs, as I mentioned earlier, and it's something we've had to be really careful with. We chose to rent instead of buy because of the financial uncertainty that comes with being in the nonprofit sector\u2014there are times when my hours can be unpredictable, and I didn't want to take on the burden of a mortgage. Plus, with the way the neighborhood has been changing, I thought it might be better to stay flexible. We've been in this apartment for about three years now, and while it's not perfect, it's a place that feels like home.

For example, our utility bills tend to go up in the winter when we're using more heat, and they drop a bit in the summer. We also had a spike in our grocery costs around the holidays, especially when we were buying gifts for the kids and trying to make sure we had enough food for everyone during the busy holiday season. School-related expenses also come into play\u2014like back-to-school supplies, uniforms, and activities. We usually budget a little extra for those times, but it still catches us off guard sometimes. Another thing that affected our budget was the cost of childcare\u2014when Claire had to take on more hours at work to cover some unexpected expenses, we had to pay for additional childcare, which added a few hundred dollars a month.

We've had moments where we wanted to save for bigger things, like maybe a down payment on a home or even a vacation, but the reality of our financial situation has made those goals feel out of reach.

Most weeks, I'm in the office from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., but I often stay late a few times a week to wrap up meetings or coordinate with other agencies. There are also days when I need to make home visits or attend community events, which can add a few extra hours to my schedule. It's not always a nine-to-five job, but I've come to accept that the work requires flexibility, especially when people are in crisis and need support right away. I've learned to manage my time as best as I can, but there are definitely weeks when I feel like I'm running on empty. Still, I know that the work I do matters, and that keeps me going, even when the hours are long and the stress is high.\n\n",

That comes from my full-time salary at HopeBridge and Claire's part-time work at the community health center. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our basic needs and a little extra for the kids' activities or unexpected expenses. I think the hardest part is knowing that even with both of us working, we're still stretching every dollar. We've had to be really careful with our budget, and I've learned to appreciate the small things\u2014like a meal we can afford or a weekend where we don't have to worry about bills. It's not always easy, but I'm proud of how we've managed to stay afloat and keep our heads above water.

We have health insurance, which covers both of us and the kids, and that's been a huge relief, especially with my back issues and blood pressure. We also get a certain amount of paid time off, though it's not as generous as I'd like\u2014it's more of a basic package.

I have a good relationship with my manager, Sarah. She's been with the organization for over a decade, and she's someone who truly understands the challenges of the work we do. She's not just focused on metrics or efficiency; she genuinely cares about the people we serve and the well-being of her team. I've had moments where I've felt overwhelmed, and she's always been someone I can talk to without judgment. As for my coworkers, I'd say we're a pretty tight-knit group. We've been through a lot together\u2014late nights, tough cases, even some personal struggles. There's a real sense of camaraderie, and I think that's what keeps us going. We look out for each other, whether it's covering for someone who's sick or just offering a listening ear when things get heavy. I wouldn't say it's perfect\u2014there are disagreements and moments of frustration, like any workplace\u2014but overall, I feel lucky to be part of a team that values empathy, collaboration, and making a real difference in people's lives.\n\n",

He had a strong work ethic and was always passionate about making sure the structures he worked on were safe and functional. I remember him coming home tired but proud, especially when a project was completed successfully.

My mom, on the other hand, worked directly with teachers and students. She helped with classroom management, provided extra support to kids who needed it, and even helped organize school events.
