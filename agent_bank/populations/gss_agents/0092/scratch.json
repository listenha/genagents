  "agent_profile_summary": "Patrick Harris, a 41-year-old policy analyst from Charleston, South Carolina, grew up in a working-class family that valued education and hard work, despite limited formal schooling for his parents. A defining moment in his life came during college when he chose a political campaign internship over a more secure law firm position, a decision that set him on a path toward public service and a career in conservative policy. Now married with two children, he balances his work at a think tank with family life, prioritizing community involvement and faith. His days are structured around his job, family routines, and volunteer work, reflecting a commitment to both his professional ideals and his role as a father. Patrick’s life is shaped by a tension between his career ambitions and the demands of family, yet he remains grounded in the values instilled by his parents and the support of his close-knit community."
