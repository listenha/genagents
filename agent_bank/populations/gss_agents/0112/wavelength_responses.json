My experiences in Newark—where life is often unpredictable and challenges come from unexpected places—reinforce the idea that things can go wrong without a clear cause.

While I have a strong sense of wanderlust that brought me to Newark, I also carry a deep connection to my roots in Lisbon.

While there may be some universal elements (like symmetry), the way people perceive and value beauty varies widely.

For example, the smell of my mother’s cooking or the sound of rain on the window are beautiful to me in ways that may not be universally recognized. However, I also recognize that there are some objective elements, like the symmetry of a face or the structure of a building, that many people agree on. Still, I lean more toward the subjective side because beauty is often about meaning and feeling, not just measurable traits."
