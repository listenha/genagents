  "agent_profile_summary": "Santiago Martinez, a 31-year-old financial analyst from Lisbon, Portugal, now calls Newark, New Jersey, home, where he has built a life through determination and the support of his community. After moving to the U.S. at 16, he chose to stay in Newark rather than return to Portugal for a scholarship, a decision that led him to work multiple jobs while earning his degree. Today, he balances a demanding career with caring for his younger sister, Clara, as she pursues nursing, and supporting his wife, Maria, in her teaching career. His commitment to education and community is evident in his volunteer work and his efforts to give back, mirroring the sacrifices his parents made. Santiago’s life is shaped by a tension between his drive for financial stability and his deep value on family and faith, which guide his choices and how he connects with others."
