Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nSantiago Martinez: I was born in Lisbon, Portugal, to a family that valued education and hard work, even though we didn't have a lot of money. My father worked as a mechanic, and my mother was a nurse, though she only finished high school. When I was 16, my family decided to move to the United States in search of better opportunities, and we settled in Newark, New Jersey. It was a big change for me, and I had to learn English quickly. I remember feeling out of place at first, but I was determined to make the most of it. I worked part-time after school to help my family, but I never stopped studying. I eventually earned a graduate degree in business, which helped me land a full-time job in finance. I met my wife, Maria, while we were both working at the same company, and we got married a few years ago. Life hasn't been easy, but I've always believed that with perseverance, you can build a better future for yourself and your family.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nSantiago Martinez: Yes, there was a moment that changed everything for me. After we moved to Newark, I was working two part-time jobs to help support my family while going to night classes at a community college. I remember one evening, after a long shift at a local grocery store, I was walking home through the rain, exhausted and wondering if I was making the right choice. I had just received a letter from the university in Lisbon offering me a scholarship to study business, but I knew my parents couldn't afford to send me back. That night, I sat on the steps of our apartment building and made a decision: I would stay in the U.S., work harder, and find a way to earn my degree here. It wasn't easy, but I enrolled in a local university, took on more responsibilities, and eventually got into a graduate program. That moment of clarity was the turning point\u2014it showed me that I had the strength to create my own path, no matter how difficult the road was.\n\n",

The rain, the exhaustion, the letter in my hand\u2014it all came together to make me realize that I couldn't wait for opportunities to come to me. I had to take control. I remember telling myself, 'If I don't fight for this, who will?' That decision wasn't just about my education; it was about my family, my future, and proving to myself that I was capable of more than the circumstances I was born into. I didn't have a lot, but I had determination, and I used that to build something better.\n\n",

My mother, for instance, was the one who encouraged me to apply for that scholarship in Lisbon. She didn't know English well, but she wrote the letter herself, translating it from Portuguese to English with the help of a neighbor. That meant the world to me. And then there was Mr. Alvarez, my high school teacher, who saw something in me and helped me get into the community college. He even gave me a few books on business and finance, which I still keep on my shelf. I don't think I could have made it without those small acts of kindness. Organizations, too\u2014like the local community center, which offered free tutoring and career counseling. They helped me navigate the system here, which was completely foreign to me at the time. I've always believed that no one should have to face challenges alone, and now that I'm in a better place, I try to pay it forward whenever I can.\n\n",

My parents have always been a source of strength for me, even though they faced their own struggles. My father, despite only having a high school education, always encouraged me to pursue knowledge, and my mother, though she didn't have much formal education, taught me the value of compassion and hard work. Clara is 18 now and is studying nursing at a community college here in New Jersey. She's been my biggest supporter, and I admire her courage. She's the one who helped me navigate the complexities of the U.S. healthcare system when I was first trying to get my foot in the door in finance. As for Uncle Joaquim, he stayed in Portugal and runs a small family-owned restaurant. We don't talk as often as I'd like, but whenever I visit, it feels like coming home.

One of them is Luis, a childhood friend from Lisbon who also moved to the U.S. a few years after me. He ended up working in construction, but he's always been a source of encouragement. We used to meet up every Sunday for coffee, and he'd remind me that I was doing the right thing, even when I felt like giving up. Then there's Elena, a coworker from the finance company where I first started. She became like a sister to me\u2014someone I could talk to about everything, from work stress to family issues. She was the one who introduced me to Maria, actually. Without her, I don't know if I would have met my wife. And there's also David, a mentor at my current job.

It's a working-class area, with a lot of immigrants like myself, and it's not always easy. There are parts of the city that feel run down, with old buildings that need repairs and streets that can be a bit rough around the edges. But there's also a strong sense of community here. People look out for each other, and there are local businesses that have been around for decades. I live in a small apartment near the train station, which makes commuting to work easier. The area has its issues\u2014like high crime rates and limited access to certain services\u2014but I've learned to navigate it.

I've seen things that no one should have to see\u2014drug deals, fights, people getting hurt. But at the same time, I've also seen the kindness in people here. I've had neighbors watch out for me, warn me about dangerous areas, and even help me when I was struggling. I think it's a balance. You learn to be aware, to trust your instincts, but you also learn to rely on the people around you.

I've met people from all over the world, and that diversity is something I really appreciate. It reminds me that no matter where you come from, you can find a way to make a life for yourself here. I've also seen how the community can come together in tough times\u2014like when the local church organized a food drive for families in need, or when neighbors helped each other during the winter when the heating bills were too high.

I usually wake up around 6:30 a.m., make a quick breakfast, and head to the train station for my 7:15 a.m. commute to work. My job in finance can be demanding, so I often work late into the evening, sometimes staying until 8 or 9 p.m. When I get home, I try to spend time with Maria\u2014we have dinner together, maybe watch a movie or go for a walk if the weather is nice. On weekends, I like to help Clara with her nursing studies, or we might go to a local caf\u00e9 and catch up. I also try to set aside some time for myself, whether it's reading, listening to music, or just sitting on the balcony and thinking.

I work Monday through Friday, typically from 7:15 a.m. to 8 or 9 p.m., depending on how busy the day is.

The pastor, Reverend Thompson, has been a good friend and a source of guidance for me. He's helped me through some tough times, especially when I was first starting out and feeling lost. I also try to volunteer at least once a month, usually at the community center where I got my first tutoring sessions. It's a way for me to give back, to help others the way I was helped.

If we do have children, I imagine their days would be pretty structured, especially during the school year. They'd probably wake up early, have breakfast, and then head off to school.

The running has become a real anchor for me\u2014it's not just exercise, it's a way to clear my mind and feel connected to something bigger than myself. But what makes it hard is the stress that comes with work and family responsibilities. Sometimes, when I'm swamped with deadlines or helping Clara with her studies, I forget to take care of myself.

It started after I spent a few weeks working late almost every night, trying to meet a big project deadline at work. At first, I thought it was just from sitting too long, but it got worse\u2014so bad that I couldn't sleep properly and had to take a few days off. I went to the clinic, and the doctor said it was probably from poor posture and muscle strain. He gave me some physical therapy exercises and suggested I take more breaks throughout the day. I also started using a standing desk at work, which has helped a lot. It was a wake-up call, really. It made me realize that I can't ignore my body's signals just because I'm busy. Since then, I've been more mindful about stretching, taking short walks during the day, and even using a foam roller at home.

Tell me all about how you have been feeling.\n\nSantiago Martinez: Over the past year, life has been a mix of growth, challenges, and quiet moments of reflection. Professionally, I've taken on more responsibilities at work, which has been both exciting and stressful. I've been leading a few new projects, and while it's pushed me out of my comfort zone, I've also learned a lot about leadership and resilience. On a personal level, helping Clara with her nursing studies has been incredibly rewarding. Watching her grow into such a dedicated and compassionate person has reminded me of the importance of education and the sacrifices my parents made for me. At the same time, I've been dealing with some personal doubts\u2014questioning whether I'm doing enough for my family, whether I'm making the right choices for our future. But I've also found comfort in the small things: the way Maria smiles when she's cooking, the sound of rain on the windows as I sit with a book, the quiet strength of my community. I think I've come to accept that life isn't about perfection\u2014it's about showing up, day after day, even when it's hard.\n\n",

Talking about the changes in my schedule, like helping Clara with her studies and taking up running, reminded me of how life is always evolving, and how important it is to adapt. It also made me think about the balance between work, family, and self-care. I used to believe that success meant pushing through without rest, but now I see that taking care of my body and mind is just as important as any other part of my life. The conversation about my health also brought back the memory of that back pain flare-up\u2014a moment that forced me to slow down and listen to my body. It was a humbling experience, but it taught me that I can't ignore my well-being, no matter how busy I am. And when I spoke about the support I receive from Maria and others, I realized how much I owe to the people who help me stay healthy and grounded. These reflections have made me more grateful for the small, consistent efforts I make to take care of myself, and I hope to continue that path with even more intention and care.",

There were times when I felt like I wasn't doing enough, like I was failing my parents or Clara by not being able to provide everything they deserved.

I see how tired she gets, but she never complains. She's the kind of person who puts others first, even when she's not feeling her best. Clara, on the other hand, has been amazing. She's taking her studies seriously, and I can see how much she's growing\u2014not just academically, but as a person. She's become more confident, more compassionate, and she's learning to take care of herself in ways I didn't expect. My parents, too, have been adjusting. They came here with so much hope, and while they still have their struggles, they're proud of what we've built. My father, in particular, has been trying to learn more about the U.S. healthcare system, and he's been asking me questions about insurance and doctor visits.

How about you?\n\nSantiago Martinez: For me, religion and spirituality have always been a source of strength, especially during the hardest times. Growing up in a Protestant household in Lisbon, going to church was a regular part of life. It wasn't just about the sermons or the rituals\u2014it was about the sense of community, the prayers, and the belief that there was something bigger than ourselves. When we moved to Newark, I was worried that I would lose that connection, but I was surprised to find a small Protestant congregation here that felt just as welcoming. Reverend Thompson has been a guiding light for me, not just in my faith, but in my life. He's helped me through moments of doubt, reminded me that it's okay to struggle, and taught me that faith isn't about being perfect\u2014it's about showing up, even when you're not sure of the path ahead. I still go to church every Sunday with my family, and I find comfort in the familiar hymns and the warmth of the people around me. It's not always easy to hold onto faith in a place like Newark, where life can feel so heavy at times, but I believe that spirituality helps me stay grounded, gives me a sense of purpose, and reminds me that I'm not alone in this journey.\n\n",

I've seen how it can be a double-edged sword\u2014on one hand, it connects people, but on the other, it can also create a lot of noise and distraction. I used to have a Facebook account back when I first moved here, mostly to stay in touch with family in Portugal and some old friends from Lisbon. But over time, I found myself scrolling for hours, comparing my life to others, and feeling more stressed than connected. I decided to take a break from it, and honestly, it's been a relief. I still keep in touch with my family through regular phone calls and text messages, and I use WhatsApp with some of my friends here in Newark. I think it's important to be present in real life, to talk to people face-to-face, and to build relationships that don't rely on likes or followers. I don't want my life to be filtered or reduced to a few pictures\u2014it's too rich for that.

When I was struggling with that back pain a few years ago, it was my wife who reminded me to take it seriously, and it was my pastor who encouraged me to keep faith in the process of healing.

I know some people find comfort in online communities, and I respect that, but for me, it's the face-to-face connections that matter most.

Rent for our apartment in Newark takes up a good chunk of our income\u2014around $1,200 a month. It's not the most expensive place in the city, but it's still a significant portion of our budget. Groceries come next, especially since Maria and I both cook most of our meals at home. We try to buy in bulk and stick to what we need, but with Clara starting her nursing program and needing more supplies, that part of the budget has gone up a bit. Then there's transportation\u2014my train passes, Maria's bus fare, and the occasional Uber when we need to get somewhere quickly. We also set aside money for utilities, insurance, and a small emergency fund. It's not much, but it helps us feel more secure. I've learned to track every dollar, and I make sure we don't overspend on things that aren't essential. It's a tight budget, but we've made it work, and I'm proud of how we manage it together.\n\n",

The majority of that goes to rent, groceries, and transportation, as I mentioned. But there are also other things\u2014like Maria's teaching supplies, Clara's nursing textbooks and lab fees, and the occasional medical co-pay or prescription. We also try to set aside a little money each month for savings, even if it's just $100 or so. It's not a lot, but it gives us a sense of security. I've learned that budgeting is a lot like managing a business\u2014you have to track every expense, know where your money is going, and make adjustments when needed. Sometimes, we have to cut back on things like eating out or buying new clothes, but we've found ways to make it work.

In the winter, for example, our heating bill went up quite a bit because the apartment isn't very well insulated, and we had a particularly cold spell. We had to use the space heater more often, which added to the cost. Then there was the summer, when we had to pay more for electricity because we were using the air conditioner almost nonstop. But the biggest fluctuation was around the time Clara started her nursing program. She needed to buy a lot of textbooks, lab supplies, and even a stethoscope, which was an unexpected expense. We also had to pay for her bus passes and some extra meals when she was studying late into the night. On the other hand, during the holidays, we kept our spending in check\u2014no big dinners out or expensive gifts. We focused on what really mattered: spending time together, cooking at home, and keeping our budget as tight as possible.

    "content": "Going through the recent interview topics from questions 31 to 35 made me reflect on how much my daily life, financial responsibilities, and emotional well-being have shaped my journey over the past year. Talking about my stress levels and coping strategies reminded me of how far I've come in learning to balance work, family, and self-care. I used to think that pushing through without rest was the only way to succeed, but now I see that taking time to breathe, journal, and connect with Maria and my family is just as important. It also made me think about how we manage our finances\u2014how every dollar we save, every expense we track, and every sacrifice we make is part of building a better future for Clara and our family. I've come to accept that life isn't about perfection, but about showing up every day with intention, even when it's hard. These conversations have reminded me that I'm not just surviving\u2014I'm growing, and I'm doing it with the support of the people I love.",

That includes my full-time salary as a financial analyst, Maria's income from teaching, and the occasional freelance work I take on in the evenings. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our basic needs and save a little for the future. I've learned to be careful with every dollar, especially since we're still working toward bigger goals\u2014like Clara finishing her nursing program and eventually starting her own career. It's a tight balance, but I know that every bit of income we have is a step toward building something more stable for our family.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nSantiago Martinez: I've been at my current job for about six years now, and it's been a journey of growth and learning. The benefits that come with the job are pretty standard for a mid-sized firm\u2014health insurance, dental and vision coverage, a 401(k) plan, and a decent amount of paid time off. I get about two weeks of vacation each year, plus sick days and holidays. The health benefits have been especially important for me, especially since I've had to deal with that back pain flare-up in the past. It's reassuring to know that I can see a doctor without worrying about the cost, and that my family is also covered under the plan. I also appreciate the flexibility they offer\u2014sometimes, when I need to adjust my schedule to help Clara with her studies or attend a family event, they're understanding. It's not a perfect job, but it's given me stability, and that's something I'm truly grateful for.\n\n",

When I first started, I was pretty quiet, trying to focus on learning the ropes and not making any mistakes. But as I grew more confident in my role, I started to build stronger connections with my coworkers. My manager, Sarah, has been pretty supportive\u2014she's given me opportunities to take on more responsibility and has always been open to feedback. I think she sees potential in me, and that means a lot. As for my coworkers, some of them have become good friends. We have lunch breaks together, and we often talk about everything from work challenges to our personal lives. There's a sense of camaraderie, especially during busy times when we're all working late. I've learned that trust and respect are the foundation of any good working relationship, and I try to bring that same level of integrity and kindness to my interactions. I don't think I'd ever be the kind of person who just shows up and leaves\u2014work is more than a job for me, it's part of who I am, and I want to be someone people can count on.\n\n",

I usually start at 7:15 a.m. and work until around 8 or 9 p.m., depending on how busy the day is. Mondays and Fridays tend to be a bit lighter, while midweek days are often the busiest, especially when we're preparing reports or dealing with market changes. The company does offer some flexibility, which I really appreciate. If I need to leave a little early for a family event or adjust my hours to help Clara with her studies, they're usually understanding. That said, there are times when I have to stay late, and I've learned to manage my time carefully so I can still be there for my family.

I'm proud of how Maria and I have managed our budget, especially with Clara's education being such a big expense.

My father worked as a mechanic at a local garage, and he was always the first one in and the last one out. He didn't have much formal education, but he had a natural talent for fixing things, and he took pride in his work. He worked at least 40 hours a week, sometimes more, especially when the garage was busy. My mother, on the other hand, worked as a nurse at a small clinic in Lisbon. She didn't have a college degree, but she had years of experience and a deep sense of responsibility. She worked long shifts, often 12 hours a day, and she always made sure that the patients were taken care of, even if it meant staying late. Both of them worked hard to provide for our family, and I remember watching them sacrifice so much for us. They never complained, even when times were tough. It's one of the reasons I value education and hard work so much\u2014it's something they taught me through their own lives.\n\n",

He would spend hours under the hood, diagnosing issues, replacing parts, and making sure every vehicle left the garage running smoothly. His most important duties were ensuring the safety of the drivers and maintaining the reputation of the garage. He had a way of making people feel at ease, even when their car was broken down and they were worried about getting to work. My mother, as a nurse, had a completely different kind of responsibility. Her most important activities were caring for patients, listening to their concerns, and providing comfort when they needed it most. She would stay late if someone was in pain or if a patient needed extra attention. I remember seeing her come home exhausted but always with a smile, because she believed she was making a difference. Their work wasn't glamorous, but it was meaningful, and it taught me that no job is too small if it helps someone else.\n\n",

The garage was run by my uncle, who had started it years before, and my father took over after he retired. It was a modest business, but it had a good reputation in the neighborhood. They fixed everything from cars to motorcycles, and sometimes even did some plumbing or electrical work if they had the tools. My mother worked at a small clinic that served the local community, mostly elderly patients and families who couldn't afford private healthcare. She didn't have a lot of resources, but she always made sure that her patients felt seen and heard. She would stay late if needed, and she never turned anyone away, even if it meant working for free.
