However, she has also described implementing strategies to manage her stress, such as setting boundaries, seeking support, and practicing mindfulness. While she does acknowledge dealing with stress, she also emphasizes the importance of self-care and coping mechanisms, indicating that she is more resilient and adaptive to stress than someone who would choose a lower score.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Erin describes herself as extremely liberal and involved in community service and activism. She does not mention any artistic pursuits or interests, suggesting she is more focused on social and environmental issues.

She mentions dealing with periods of anxiety and seeking support from a therapist, which suggests she is aware of her nervous tendencies but manages them. This indicates she is not someone who gets nervous easily all the time, but there are times when she does feel nervous. Therefore, a middle ground seems more appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Erin appears to be a person who engages in community service, participates in various activist roles, and is involved in planning and executing events. These activities suggest that she has a creative and imaginative side, as she likely needs to visualize and conceptualize these projects.
