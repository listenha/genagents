            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Erin is described as an environmental advocate and community organizer. While she values community and personal connections, the description does not suggest a preference for or expertise in analytical thinking. Erin's work and lifestyle seem more focused on grassroots organizing and community service, which do not necessarily require extensive analytical skills. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Erin would place herself closer to the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_4": "Based on the interview, Erin is described as a person who values grassroots organizing and community action, indicating a more intuitive and action-oriented mindset. She emphasizes the importance of taking immediate action and being involved in community projects, which suggests she is more inclined to act quickly rather than overthinking things. This aligns more with the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Erin Mcdonald describes herself as someone who has dealt with periods of anxiety, especially during high-stress times at work. However, she mentions that she has taken steps to address these feelings, such as talking to a therapist and practicing mindfulness. This suggests that while she can experience stress, she has strategies to manage it. Therefore, it is unlikely that she would choose the highest score of 5, as she has shown some resilience in handling stress. On the other hand, she does acknowledge that she can feel overwhelmed, indicating that she does struggle with reasoning under pressure at times. Given her experience and coping mechanisms, a middle score seems more fitting.",

While she values logic and problem-solving in her work, there is no explicit mention of exceptional logical abilities. Her political views and community involvement suggest a more empathetic and people-focused approach rather than a purely logical one. Therefore, it is more likely that she would rate herself slightly above average but not exceptionally high.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Erin is described as a dedicated environmental advocate and community organizer. While her work involves some analysis and strategic thinking, it is more rooted in social and environmental issues rather than pure logic and mathematics. She is also described as a 'strong democrat' and a 'liberal,' which suggests she might prioritize values and emotions over strict logical analysis. Therefore, it seems more likely that Erin would rate herself lower on this scale, indicating a moderate level of logical thinking.",

She seems to prioritize thoroughness and reflection, especially in her work and community involvement. This suggests she would lean towards the higher end of the scale.",
            "REI_9": "Based on the interview, Erin Mcdonald is described as a thoughtful and community-oriented individual who values connection and purpose. While she emphasizes her commitment to activism and community involvement, there is no indication that she struggles with analytical thinking or problem-solving. Her work in a non-profit organization and her involvement in various community projects suggest that she is adept at using logic and reason to address issues. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that she would rate her ability to use logic in problem-solving as high.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Erin seems to be a reflective and thoughtful individual. She often discusses her motivations and values, suggesting that she considers her actions carefully. For instance, she talks about her political views, community involvement, and the importance of her work, indicating that she has clear reasons for her decisions.
