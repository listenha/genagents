From my perspective, horror movies can be thrilling and engaging, but they are not universally terrifying. I find them more exciting than horrifying, and they rarely leave me bored. However, I also recognize that some horror movies might not resonate with everyone, and for some people, they could be either too scary or too unoriginal. Based on my own experiences and the general purpose of horror movies, I believe they fall more on the 'scared' end of the spectrum, but not to the extreme of being 'scared to death.'"

My experience with math in school and in my marketing career (where I used data analysis and statistics) has shown me that it's not just about numbers—it's about patterns, logic, and solving real-world problems.

This aligns more with the idea that history is random and not a linear path of improvement.

From my perspective, venture capital is not a passive endeavor—it demands active decision-making, strategic risk-taking, and a willingness to push boundaries.

It is not bland, but it also doesn't reach the level of being intensely zesty.
