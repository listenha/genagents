Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nJessica Schroer: I was born in Naperville, Illinois, and grew up in a small, tight-knit community in the East North Central region. My parents were both hardworking people\u2014my father worked as a mechanic, and my mother was a part-time nurse and full-time homemaker. We lived in a modest home, but it was always filled with love and laughter. I was the oldest of two siblings, and I remember helping my mother with chores around the house while my younger brother played outside. I always knew I wanted to go to college, so I worked hard in school, even though I didn't have a lot of resources. I received a scholarship to a local university, where I studied business administration. I graduated with a bachelor's degree and landed a job in marketing shortly after. I met my husband, Mark, during a company event, and we got married a few years later. Life has been full of ups and downs, but I've always tried to stay grounded in my faith and values. Recently, I've been taking some time off work due to a temporary illness, which has given me a chance to reflect on everything I've accomplished so far and what I still hope to achieve.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nJessica Schroer: One of the most defining moments in my life was when I decided to pursue a college education. I had always known I wanted to go to college, but the reality of it was daunting. My parents didn't have a lot of money, and I was the first in my family to consider higher education. I remember sitting at the kitchen table with my mother, who had just finished her associate's degree, and she looked at me and said, 'If you want it, you have to work for it.' That moment stuck with me. I took on part-time jobs during high school, saved every penny I could, and applied for scholarships. I was accepted to a local university on a partial scholarship, and I was determined to make the most of it. There were times when I felt overwhelmed, especially when I saw my friends from high school who had taken different paths\u2014some went straight into the workforce, others joined the military. But I knew that for me, college was the path that would give me the most opportunities. Looking back, I don't think I would have chosen any other path. It shaped who I am today, gave me the confidence to pursue my career, and ultimately led me to meet my husband. It wasn't an easy decision, but it was the right one for me.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nJessica Schroer: I think it was a conscious choice, but one that felt almost inevitable. I remember feeling a mix of fear and excitement when I got that acceptance letter. It wasn't just about the education\u2014it was about proving to myself and my family that I could do something bigger than what we had always known. I didn't just choose college; I chose to believe in a future that felt out of reach. That belief carried me through late nights in the library, through the stress of exams, and even through the moments when I doubted if I was good enough. I think, in a way, I didn't have much of a choice because I had already made up my mind. But I also know that if I hadn't made that decision, I wouldn't be the person I am today\u2014someone who values hard work, opportunity, and the power of education.\n\n",

I think a lot of people don't realize how much support is out there, especially for someone like me who was the first in my family to go to college. My high school counselor was incredibly supportive, and she helped me apply for scholarships I didn't even know existed. There was also a local community organization that offered mentorship programs for students from similar backgrounds. I remember one mentor in particular, Mrs. Thompson, who took me under her wing and encouraged me to think bigger than just my small town. She even helped me with my college essays and gave me confidence when I was struggling with self-doubt. Without people like her, I don't know if I would have had the courage to take that first step. I believe in paying it forward now, and I try to mentor young women in my community who are considering college. It's a small way to give back, but it means a lot to me.\n\n",

We got married a few years after I graduated, and we've been building a life together ever since. We don't have children yet, but we've talked about starting a family in the next few years. Mark is incredibly supportive of my goals, and we both value stability and hard work. He's the kind of person who always has a plan, which I think complements my more spontaneous side. Our relationship has had its challenges, especially with the demands of work and life, but we've always made time for each other.

It's amazing how the support I received from my mother, my high school counselor, and even a mentor like Mrs. Thompson made all the difference. I'm grateful for the people who believed in me when I wasn't sure I could believe in myself. And now, being married to Mark, who shares my values and supports my dreams, has given me a sense of stability and purpose.

One of them is Sarah, who I met in college. We were in the same marketing class, and we bonded over our shared love of strategy and our desire to make an impact in our careers. Even though we've both taken different paths\u2014she's in advertising and I'm in marketing\u2014we still keep in touch and often catch up over coffee or video calls. She's one of the few people who really understands the challenges of balancing work and personal life, especially as women in male-dominated fields. Then there's my friend Emily, who I met through a church group. She's been a great source of spiritual support and encouragement, especially during the times when I've felt uncertain about my direction in life. I also have a few close coworkers who I consider friends, though our relationships are more professional.

It's a mix of older homes and newer developments, and there's a real sense of community here. The streets are tree-lined, and there are a few parks nearby where I like to take walks, especially on the weekends. I live in a two-story house with my husband, Mark, and we've made it our own\u2014there's a small garden in the backyard where we grow some herbs and vegetables, and the living room is filled with books and photos of our family. It's not a huge house, but it feels cozy and welcoming. One of the things I love most about this neighborhood is the sense of safety and familiarity. I know my neighbors, and they know me. There's a local library just a few minutes away, and I've gotten to know some of the staff there. It's a place where I can lose myself in a good book or attend a community event.

I think it's also helped that Naperville is a city that values family and stability, which aligns with the kind of life I want to build with Mark.

I love knowing that if I need help, whether it's borrowing a cup of sugar or just someone to talk to, there's always someone nearby. That said, there are also downs. Naperville is a great place, but it can feel a bit insular at times. Sometimes I miss the energy of the city, especially when I'm working on creative projects or just feeling the need for a change of scenery. Mark and I have talked about maybe taking a trip somewhere new in the next few years, just to see what else is out there. Still, I wouldn't trade this place for anything.

On weekdays, I usually wake up around 7 a.m., make a cup of coffee, and spend a little time reading or journaling before getting ready for the day. Since I'm currently on a temporary leave due to illness, my days are a bit more relaxed than they would be if I were working full-time.

If we did have children, I imagine their routine would be similar to what many families in our neighborhood follow\u2014rising early, having a healthy breakfast, and heading off to school. After school, they'd probably participate in activities like sports or music lessons, which are popular here.

I was diagnosed with a mild case of chronic fatigue syndrome a couple of years ago, which has required me to be more intentional about rest, nutrition, and stress management. It wasn't something I was aware of at first\u2014I used to push through exhaustion, thinking it was just a busy lifestyle. But after a few months of feeling constantly drained, I finally made an appointment with my doctor. The diagnosis was a bit of a wake-up call, but it also gave me a better understanding of my body and what it needs to function at its best. Since then, I've made some lifestyle changes, like eating more whole foods, reducing my caffeine intake, and incorporating more movement into my day, even if it's just a short walk or stretching session. I've also started seeing a therapist to help me manage the stress that comes with work and life in general. It's been a journey, but I've learned that taking care of my health isn't just about avoiding illness\u2014it's about creating a foundation for the life I want to live, both for myself and for Mark.

On one hand, having a routine\u2014like waking up at the same time each day, eating regular meals, and setting aside time for exercise\u2014makes it easier to maintain my health. I've found that when I stick to these habits, I feel more energized and in control. But on the other hand, life can be unpredictable, and sometimes I struggle with consistency, especially when I'm feeling fatigued or overwhelmed. I think the hardest part is learning to listen to my body and not push through when I need rest. I used to think that being productive meant being constantly active, but I've come to realize that rest is just as important. What helps me stay on track is having support from Mark, who reminds me to take breaks and prioritize self-care. He's been my biggest advocate in this journey, and I'm grateful for that.

The most significant was when I was diagnosed with a mild case of chronic fatigue syndrome, which I mentioned earlier. It was a bit of a turning point for me, as it forced me to slow down and pay closer attention to my body's signals. Around the same time, I also experienced a flare-up of some old back pain I had from years of sitting at a desk during college and my early career. It wasn't anything serious, but it reminded me how important it is to take care of my posture and incorporate movement into my daily life. I started seeing a physical therapist, and through some targeted exercises, I've been able to manage the pain much better. I also had a minor surgery last year to remove a small cyst on my wrist, which was a bit of a shock at first, but it turned out to be nothing major.

I had to learn how to pace myself, which meant saying no to some things I would have normally said yes to. It did affect my work to some extent\u2014I had to take that temporary leave, which was difficult because I love what I do. But it also gave me the chance to reflect on what really matters. I've come to realize that being healthy isn't just about showing up for work or meeting deadlines; it's about being present for the people I care about, like Mark. I know that if I don't take care of myself, I won't be able to support him or the life we're building. It's not perfect, and there are days when I still struggle, but I'm learning to be more patient with myself and to see these challenges as part of a larger journey\u2014one that's about balance, resilience, and finding peace in the little things.\n\n",

On one hand, I'm really proud of how I've been taking my health more seriously. I've learned to listen to my body in ways I never did before, and that's given me a deeper sense of peace. I've also been spending more time with Mark, which has been incredibly grounding. We've been working on our communication and making sure we're both on the same page about our future, whether that's career goals, starting a family, or just enjoying the little moments. On the other hand, there have been days when I've felt stuck or unsure about what's next. I think part of that comes from the fact that I've been on this temporary leave for longer than I expected, and it's made me question whether I'm still as driven as I used to be. But I've also come to realize that it's okay to take time to reflect and reassess. Life isn't just about moving forward all the time\u2014it's also about pausing, learning, and growing in ways that aren't always obvious. I've been trying to focus more on gratitude, on the small joys like a good cup of coffee in the morning or a walk with Mark in the evening. I think I'm in a better place now than I was a year ago, even if it doesn't always feel like it.\n\n",

I remember feeling like I was constantly running on empty, and it was hard to keep up with everything.

My parents were deeply committed to their beliefs, and we attended church every Sunday, which was a time for both worship and community. It was in those early years that I learned the importance of prayer, gratitude, and trusting in something greater than myself. Even now, as I navigate the challenges of health and life, my faith continues to be a source of comfort and strength. I find peace in knowing that I'm not alone in this journey, and that there's a higher purpose to the struggles I face.

When I was in college and early in my career, I was more active on platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, mostly to stay connected with classmates, colleagues, and industry trends. But over time, I found that scrolling through feeds or comparing my life to others didn't really bring me peace\u2014it often left me feeling more stressed or distracted. I've tried to be more intentional with my time online, so now I only use Facebook occasionally to stay in touch with family and close friends. I also follow a few pages related to health and wellness, which have been helpful in my journey with chronic fatigue. I think it's important to have a digital presence, but I've learned that it's just as important to set boundaries. I prefer spending my time reading, journaling, or talking to people face-to-face rather than engaging with the noise of social media.

I've found that the kind of support I need comes from the people I know in real life\u2014my family, my husband, and the close friends I've built relationships with over the years. I think social media can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can connect you to communities and resources that might be helpful, but on the other hand, it can also amplify stress or make you feel isolated if you're comparing your life to others. For me, the most meaningful support has always been face-to-face or through phone calls and letters. I remember when I was going through my health challenges, it was my mother who would call me every evening just to check in, and that made all the difference. I also found comfort in my church community, where people genuinely care and are there for you when you need them. I think it's important to have a support system that feels real and personal, not just virtual. That said, I do appreciate the occasional post or article that inspires me, especially around health and wellness, but I don't see it as a substitute for the kind of connection that comes from being physically present with someone.\n\n",

There were times when I felt overwhelmed by the uncertainty of my health and the pace of life, especially with the temporary leave from work. But I've started to focus more on mindfulness and self-compassion. I've taken up journaling more seriously, which helps me process my emotions and track my progress. I also find that spending time in nature\u2014whether it's a walk in the neighborhood park or just sitting in the garden\u2014helps me reset and feel more grounded. I've also leaned more heavily on my faith, especially during moments when I feel lost or anxious.

Our mortgage payment is around $1,800, which is a significant portion of our budget, especially since we're still paying it off. Groceries come in at about $800 a month, which can add up quickly when you're trying to eat healthfully and support your family. Healthcare has also been a major expense, particularly with my ongoing treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome and the physical therapy sessions I've been attending. I also have insurance through my job, but the out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions and doctor visits can be a bit of a strain. On the positive side, we've been able to keep our other expenses relatively low\u2014things like utilities, car payments, and occasional entertainment.

We typically spend around that amount, give or take a few hundred dollars depending on the month. The majority of that goes toward our mortgage, groceries, and healthcare, as I mentioned earlier. We also have a car payment of about $350, and we try to set aside $200 for savings each month. Utilities, like electricity and internet, come in at around $250, and we occasionally spend a bit more on dining out or small personal purchases.

For example, during the winter months, our heating bill went up significantly compared to the summer, which was much more manageable. We also had a few unexpected expenses, like a new furnace filter and some repairs on the roof after a heavy rainstorm. Then there was the holiday season, which always brings a spike in expenses\u2014gifts for family, holiday decorations, and a few dinners out with friends. On the flip side, we saved a bit more during the spring and summer when we were able to cook more at home and cut back on dining out. One thing that's stayed pretty consistent is our mortgage and car payment, which are fixed costs. I think what's helped us manage the fluctuations is having a budget that we both stick to and being open to adjusting it when needed.

It's been a challenging year, but also one of growth. I've learned that health is not just about physical well-being\u2014it's about listening to my body, finding balance, and being kind to myself when things don't go as planned. I've also come to appreciate how much support I have from Mark, my family, and even my faith. It's comforting to know that I'm not alone in this, and that even in the toughest moments, there are people who care and want to help. These experiences have taught me resilience, patience, and the importance of self-compassion. I'm still learning, but I'm grateful for the lessons I've gained and the strength I've found within myself.",

Normally, I bring in around $6,000 a month before taxes, which helps cover our expenses and allows us to save a little each month. Mark's salary from his IT job is also a steady source of income, and together we've been able to manage our finances reasonably well. It's been a bit of an adjustment not having my full paycheck, but we've been relying on savings and the income from his job to keep things running smoothly. I know it's not the same as before, but it's given us a chance to slow down and focus on what really matters\u2014like our health, our relationship, and planning for the future.\n\n",

The benefits package is pretty standard for a mid-sized company\u2014health insurance, dental, vision, and a 401(k) plan with company matching. We also get a generous amount of paid time off, including vacation days, sick leave, and holidays. I really appreciated the flexibility they offered, especially in the early years when I was still figuring out how to balance work and life. One of the things I liked most was the opportunity for professional development\u2014they covered the cost of some industry certifications and even encouraged us to attend conferences. That was especially helpful when I was trying to stay current with the fast-paced world of digital marketing. Even though I'm on leave now, I still feel a sense of loyalty to the company and the people I work with.

My manager, Karen, has been a great mentor to me\u2014she's supportive, fair, and always willing to listen. I remember when I first started, I was really nervous about proving myself, but she made me feel like my voice mattered. She encouraged me to take on bigger projects and gave me the confidence to step outside my comfort zone. As for my coworkers, I've always found them to be a mix of friendly and professional. There are a few people I've worked closely with for years, and we've developed a real camaraderie. We've had our disagreements, of course, but overall, I've always felt like part of a team. I think the key to good workplace relationships is mutual respect and communication, and I've tried to embody that in everything I do.

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nJessica Schroer: My work schedule was pretty predictable for the most part, though there were always a few variables depending on the projects we were working on. I had a standard 9-to-5 schedule, and while I did have some flexibility in how I structured my day\u2014like working from home a couple of days a week or adjusting my hours when needed\u2014it wasn't as flexible as I sometimes wish it had been. Marketing is a field that often requires last-minute changes or late-night work, especially when we were launching campaigns or dealing with client deadlines. I remember there were times when I'd have to stay late to finalize a social media strategy or meet a client's request, even if it meant working past 7 or 8 p.m. I always tried to be as efficient as possible, but there were definitely weeks when the schedule felt less predictable. Now that I'm on leave, I've had time to reflect on how much I appreciated the structure of my job, even with its challenges.

My father worked as a mechanic at a local auto shop, and he was always the kind of person who put in long hours to provide for our family. He wasn't one for complaining, but I remember seeing him come home tired after long days, especially during the colder months when the shop was busier. My mother, on the other hand, worked part-time as a nurse's aide at a nearby nursing home, which gave her more flexibility to be home with us when needed. She also managed the household, which was no small task, especially with two kids and a modest income. Looking back, I realize how much they sacrificed to give me and my brother the opportunities they never had. Their hard work taught me the value of perseverance and responsibility, and I think that's why I always felt a strong drive to succeed, especially when it came to education. It wasn't just about making a better life for myself\u2014it was about honoring the sacrifices they made and proving that their efforts hadn't been in vain.\n\n",

He worked at a local auto shop, where he spent most of his days repairing cars, replacing parts, and diagnosing issues. His most important activities involved ensuring that vehicles were safe and running smoothly, which meant long hours under the hood, often in less-than-ideal conditions. I remember seeing him come home with grease on his hands and a tired look in his eyes, but he always had a smile for us. He was the kind of person who took pride in his work, even if it wasn't glamorous. My mother, on the other hand, worked as a nurse's aide at a nearby nursing home. Her duties included assisting residents with daily tasks like bathing, feeding, and medication management. She was compassionate and patient, and I think she found fulfillment in helping others, even though it was a tough job. What I remember most about both of them is how they balanced their work with family life\u2014my father would often come home and talk about the day's challenges, while my mother would share stories from the nursing home. Their work shaped who I am today, teaching me the value of hard work, responsibility, and caring for others.\n\n",

The business was run by the owner, Mr. Jenkins, who had been in the industry for decades. My father was one of his most trusted mechanics, and he often joked that he was the 'heart' of the shop. The business itself was pretty straightforward\u2014cars would come in with various issues, and my father and the other mechanics would diagnose and fix them. It wasn't the kind of place that had the latest technology or fancy tools, but it was reliable, and people trusted it. My father made a decent living, enough to support our family, though it wasn't extravagant. He always said that the satisfaction of fixing a car and seeing someone drive off happy was worth more than the paycheck. As for my mother, she worked for a local nursing home that was part of a larger healthcare organization. It was a place where she could make a real difference in people's lives, even if it was just for a few hours a day. She often told me that her job wasn't just about the tasks she did\u2014it was about the connections she made with the residents, the stories they shared, and the small moments of kindness that made her day.
