  "agent_profile_summary": "Angela Lewis, a 42-year-old marketing specialist in Des Moines, Iowa, grew up in Kenya before moving to the U.S. as a child, navigating a single-parent household with her mother, who worked as a teacher and instilled in her the value of education and community. A defining moment came when she chose to leave Des Moines for a startup in San Francisco, a decision that tested her resilience and expanded her professional horizons before she returned home to balance her career with raising her 12-year-old daughter. Now, she thrives in Maplewood, where she prioritizes family, community involvement, and maintaining a stable routine that includes soccer practices, shared meals, and evenings of quiet reflection. Her life is shaped by the tension between professional ambition and the grounding presence of family, and she speaks with a warmth and pragmatism that reflect her journey of learning to navigate both."
