    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAngela Lewis: I was born in Kenya, but my family moved to the United States when I was just a toddler. We settled in Des Moines, Iowa, which became my home city. Growing up, my parents were divorced, and my mom took on the role of raising us. She worked hard to support our family and eventually earned her graduate degree, which opened many doors for her professionally. My father, on the other hand, didn't pursue higher education after high school, but he always encouraged us to strive for more. Despite the challenges of a single-parent household, we managed to stay close and maintain a strong bond. Education was always a priority in our home, and I excelled in school, which led me to pursue a graduate degree myself. After graduation, I got married, but unfortunately, our marriage didn't last. I'm currently working full-time as a marketing specialist, and I find it rewarding to contribute to my community through my work.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAngela Lewis: There was indeed a significant moment for me. Right after college, I had the opportunity to either take a job in marketing back in Des Moines or join a startup in San Francisco. It was a tough decision because both options had their pros and cons. Staying in Des Moines meant being closer to my family and having a stable, well-paying job, while the startup in San Francisco offered potential for rapid growth and learning new skills. In the end, I chose the startup in San Francisco. Looking back, that decision really shaped who I am today. It taught me a lot about perseverance and resilience, and it also broadened my professional network. However, it wasn't all smooth sailing. The experience was challenging, and after a few years, I realized that the work-life balance wasn't what I wanted. That's when I decided to return to Des Moines and settle down here. Now, I'm grateful for that journey because it gave me the confidence and skills to pursue my current career as a marketing specialist.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nAngela Lewis: I think for me, it was a combination of both. The decision to go to the startup in San Francisco was something I considered carefully and made a conscious choice to take the risk and grow. But once I got there, things unfolded in a way that was unexpected. Sometimes, life has its own plan, and you just have to follow it. Ultimately, it was a mix of planning and serendipity that led me to where I am now. I'm glad I took that leap, even if it wasn't always easy.\n\n",

For example, when I was working at the startup, I faced a lot of challenges, and it was tough to manage everything on my own. That's when a mentor from one of my networking events stepped in and offered guidance and support. Her advice was invaluable, and she helped me navigate through some difficult situations. More recently, a colleague at my current job suggested a new project that aligned with my interests and could potentially boost my career. So, yes, having that kind of support can make a huge difference.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nAngela Lewis: During tough times, I've found that social media can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can be a source of support and encouragement, especially when I read positive stories or comments from friends and family. On the other hand, it can also trigger feelings of comparison and inadequacy, especially when scrolling through posts about vacations or achievements. I try to be selective about what I read and engage with, focusing on the supportive messages and less on the curated highlight reels.\n\n",

The minor health setbacks, such as the sprain to my ankle, have served as reminders of the importance of staying active and taking care of myself. While I've managed to maintain a routine that includes regular exercise and balanced meals, the demands of work and parenting can be overwhelming at times. The support from my family and community has been invaluable in helping me navigate these challenges. Balancing the need for self-care with the responsibilities of being a mother and professional has required intentional effort and prioritization. Despite the occasional stress and fatigue, I find comfort in the knowledge that these moments are temporary and that the connections I've built are worth the effort. The sense of stability and support I've experienced is a cornerstone of my well-being and resilience.",

    "content": "Completing this interview and reflecting on my life story has been a profound experience. From my childhood in Kenya to my current life in Des Moines, the journey has been marked by both conscious choices and unexpected twists. Each decision, whether it was choosing to take the risk of joining a startup or returning to Des Moines for a more balanced life, has shaped who I am today. The support from my family, friends, and community has been indispensable, providing emotional and practical support during both smooth sailing and rough waters. Balancing work as a marketing specialist with being a mother and navigating the challenges of daily life has required a lot of resilience and adaptability. I am grateful for the lessons learned and the connections forged, which have enriched my life immeasurably. This interview has not only helped me understand the interconnectedness of my personal and professional life but has also reaffirmed the importance of staying grounded, prioritizing self-care, and cherishing the moments with those who matter most.",
