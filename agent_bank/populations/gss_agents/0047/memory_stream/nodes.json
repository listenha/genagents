Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nStephanie Richards: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born and raised in Princeton, New Jersey, in a family that was quite comfortable but not overly wealthy. My parents, both high school graduates, worked hard to ensure we had a good life. My father worked at a local factory, while my mother was a nurse at a nearby hospital. We were a typical suburban family, living in a modest house on Elmwood Avenue. My siblings and I grew up in a Catholic household, which was a significant part of our lives until I decided to explore other beliefs later in life.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nStephanie Richards: One such moment came when I graduated from high school. I had the opportunity to attend a prestigious private university out of state, or stay local and attend a public university. Both options seemed equally appealing, but the private university offered a more robust education and a chance to broaden my horizons. However, the cost was significantly higher, and my parents were concerned about the financial burden. After much deliberation, I decided to apply to the private university on a scholarship and take out loans to cover the rest. This decision shaped my future greatly; it pushed me to work harder and take on more responsibilities, but it also opened doors to new opportunities and experiences that I wouldn't have had otherwise.\n\n",

There were clear choices to be made, and I knew I wanted to pursue higher education, but the financial aspect was a significant factor. I had to weigh my aspirations against practical considerations. It was a moment of self-reflection, where I realized that even though the path might be challenging, it was something I was willing to undertake to achieve my goals.\n\n",

Additionally, my community had several non-profits focused on aiding students from less fortunate backgrounds. While these resources existed, I felt a sense of independence in making the decision myself, which motivated me to work harder and manage my finances responsibly.\n\n",

As for children, I don't have any, but I do have a deep desire to give back to the community, especially to young people who might face similar challenges I did.

Incorporating mindfulness and gardening into my routine has been really helpful. I find that taking a few minutes each day to focus on my breath and engage in some light gardening really grounds me and reduces anxiety. I've also started using a planner to better organize my tasks and reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed. It's a small change, but it's made a big difference in my ability to manage my time and stress.\n\n",

My biggest expenses last month were my mortgage, utilities, and groceries. I try to keep my spending on entertainment and dining out to a minimum, as those can add up quickly. My mortgage is around $1,500, and utilities are about $200. Groceries are another $300 or so, depending on how much I cook versus eating out. I allocate a bit more for transportation costs, which include gas and occasional public transit when I'm running errands. Lastly, I set aside money for my volunteer work, which covers travel and any supplies I might need for the literacy program.\n\n",

That includes my mortgage, utilities, groceries, and some discretionary spending. Last month, I spent a bit more on groceries because I had a bit of a baking spree and bought some extra ingredients for a charity event I volunteered at. I try to keep a steady budget, but there are always fluctuations depending on special occasions or unexpected expenses.\n\n",

In winter, utility costs tend to be higher because of heating, which adds about $100 more to my monthly bill. Summer months are a bit cheaper, but there's an increase in grocery costs as I tend to buy more fresh produce and ice cream for the kids. Holidays and special events also bump up my spending, especially when I host gatherings or buy gifts.
