            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Stephanie describes herself as someone who values relationships and has a close bond with her family and friends, suggesting she is not completely isolated or antisocial. However, she also mentions that she sometimes feels isolated due to her single status and lack of children, indicating she might be more reserved compared to someone who is actively seeking out social engagements. Her preference for hobbies like gardening and mindfulness also suggests a more introspective and possibly reserved personality.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Stephanie appears to have a stable and supportive life with a strong sense of community and relationships. She describes her family and friends as supportive and she volunteers to help others. These traits suggest that she is likely to be trusting of others. Additionally, her current job and work environment seem to be positive and supportive, further indicating a trusting nature.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on the interview, Stephanie appears to be quite proactive and engaged in her personal and professional life. She has taken on various responsibilities, including her job as a marketing manager, regular volunteering, and personal hobbies like gardening. This level of involvement and commitment suggests that she is not someone who tends to be lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Stephanie mentions that she has experienced stress at work and has had to manage it with mindfulness and therapy. However, she also talks about incorporating hobbies and routines that help her manage stress, indicating a relatively good ability to handle stress. While she acknowledges that stress is a part of her life, she seems to be doing well in managing it. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that she would rate herself slightly above the middle of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Stephanie seems to have a balanced perspective on her interests. She mentions that she has a hobby like gardening and volunteers for a literacy program, which suggests she engages in some creative activities. However, she does not emphasize a strong artistic inclination. Given her emphasis on mindfulness and gardening, which can be considered creative but not necessarily artistic, she seems to have a few artistic interests rather than none. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems most appropriate, but since the range only goes to 5, a 4 would indicate having more than a few artistic interests, so 3 is the best prediction.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Stephanie described herself as valuing personal connections and maintaining a strong bond with her family and friends. She also mentioned having close relationships with her siblings, friends, and participating in community activities. Additionally, she volunteered at a local non-profit and engaged in hobbies like gardening, which suggest she enjoys spending time with others. These factors indicate that Stephanie is likely more sociable and outgoing.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on Stephanie's responses, she seems to be a thoughtful and balanced individual who values relationships and community support. Her focus on personal growth, community involvement, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance suggests she is more likely to be kind and empathetic towards others rather than critical and quick to find fault.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on the interview, Stephanie Richards appears to be someone who values thoroughness and attention to detail. She mentions making significant efforts to manage her stress and improve her well-being through mindfulness and planning, suggesting a level of conscientiousness and thoroughness in her approach to tasks and life in general. She also volunteers and takes on additional responsibilities, indicating a commitment to doing things properly and effectively.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Stephanie describes herself as someone who has dealt with stress and anxiety, particularly during high-stress periods at work. She mentions using mindfulness and gardening to manage her anxiety, which suggests she does experience nervousness but is also taking steps to handle it. Therefore, it seems more likely that she would fall somewhere in the middle of the range, but leaning towards the higher end as she acknowledges dealing with some level of anxiety.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Stephanie seems to value creativity and has incorporated mindfulness and gardening into her routine, which can foster a more imaginative mindset. However, the conversation did not highlight any specific examples of her being highly imaginative or creative in her daily life. She described herself as a practical person who focuses on her responsibilities and well-being, without emphasizing her imagination. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that she would place herself somewhere in the middle of the scale."

Given that she works in a demanding role as a marketing manager and engages in personal development activities like mindfulness and gardening, it suggests she has a reasonable problem-solving ability. However, she also mentions dealing with stress and anxiety, which could indicate that she doesn't always find complex problems easy to solve. Therefore, a score of 3 seems appropriate, but leaning slightly towards the lower end of the scale given her self-acknowledged challenges with stress and anxiety.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Stephanie is described as having a moderate political view and being independent, indicating a balanced perspective. While she has achieved success in her career, the interview does not suggest exceptional logical problem-solving skills or any specific struggles in this area. Therefore, it seems more plausible that she would rate herself somewhere in the middle, acknowledging her ability but not overestimating it.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Stephanie described herself as someone who values intuition and community support, and she seems to lean more towards less structured and more emotional approaches to her life. She also mentioned that she relies on her therapist and friends for emotional support, indicating a preference for less analytical methods. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that she would agree with the statement that she is not a very analytical thinker.",
            "REI_4": "Based on Stephanie's reflections, she mentions making decisions based on practical considerations and self-reflection rather than purely intuitive choices. She emphasizes the importance of financial responsibility and the impact of independent decision-making, suggesting she values careful reasoning. However, she also describes moments where she relied on support systems and external resources, indicating she doesn't always make decisions alone. Given this balance, it seems she leans more towards careful reasoning but isn't entirely dismissive of intuition.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Stephanie described herself as someone who has experienced stress and anxiety, particularly during intense work periods. She mentioned that she has had to manage her stress levels and incorporates mindfulness practices to cope. However, she did not explicitly mention that she struggles to reason well under pressure. Given her efforts to manage stress and improve her well-being, it suggests that she is making strides to handle pressure better, but there is still room for improvement. Therefore, a score of 3 seems to be a balanced estimate, acknowledging that she faces challenges but is not at the extreme end of struggling with reasoning under pressure.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview transcript, Stephanie appears to be a balanced individual who values a mix of personal and professional development. While she discusses her career and professional achievements, she does not explicitly mention being exceptionally good at logical reasoning. Given her focus on maintaining a work-life balance and her willingness to seek support for mental health, it suggests a more moderate perspective on her logical reasoning abilities.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Stephanie seems to value logic and analytical thinking. She is a marketing manager at a tech company, which requires a significant amount of logical and strategic thinking. Additionally, she mentions incorporating mindfulness and gardening into her routine, which suggests a methodical approach to managing her well-being.

            "REI_8": "Based on the interview, Stephanie appears to be a thoughtful and deliberate individual. She described making decisions after much consideration and weighing various factors. This indicates that she values careful thought and analysis, which suggests she would likely choose a higher number on this scale.",
            "REI_9": "Based on the interview, Stephanie seems to have a balanced approach to problem-solving. While she appreciates the value of logical thinking, she also mentions that she practices mindfulness and gardening, which are more intuitive and holistic approaches. Additionally, she describes herself as a moderate politically and has a mix of practical and emotional coping strategies for stress and anxiety. This suggests that while she values logic, she does not rely solely on it for problem-solving.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Stephanie reflects on her decision-making process, especially when choosing between attending a private university and a public one. She describes the decision as a mix of choices and practical considerations, indicating that while she doesn't always have clear, explainable reasons, she does reflect on her decisions.

She has a close relationship with her family and friends, volunteers at a non-profit, and participates in hobbies like gardening. However, she also mentions that she can be isolated at times due to her work and lack of a partner or kids. This suggests she is not entirely reserved, but she also isn't extremely outgoing. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 or slightly higher, but not too high, would seem fitting.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Stephanie Richards seems to be someone who values community support and meaningful relationships. She mentions the importance of her family and friends and the sense of fulfillment she gets from helping others.

            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Stephanie described herself as someone who has taken on new hobbies like gardening and mindfulness, which are somewhat artistic in nature. While she does not identify as particularly artistic, she does engage in activities that involve creativity and a sense of aesthetics. This suggests she falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, but leans slightly towards having some artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Stephanie seems to have a balanced approach to social situations. She has a close network of friends and family, volunteers in community events, and participates in hobbies like gardening and mindfulness. However, she also mentions that she can feel isolated at times due to not having a partner or children. This suggests she values social connections but may not be extremely outgoing or sociable all the time. Given this, a score of 3 seems most appropriate, but since the range only goes from 1 to 5, a 3 isn't an option. Between 1 and 5, a 3 leans closer to 5, but considering she does value social connections, a 4 seems more fitting.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Stephanie comes across as a thoughtful and balanced individual. She has shared stories about her family, her career, and her community involvement, indicating a generally positive and supportive outlook.

This suggests that while she does experience nervousness, it is not overwhelming or pervasive. Therefore, a score of 3 seems most fitting, but since we have to choose between 1 and 5, a 3 would be closer to 1 than 5.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Stephanie Richards described herself as someone who values personal growth and meaningful work, which suggests she is open to new ideas and creative problem-solving. However, she also mentioned that she tries to maintain a balance between work and personal life, which might indicate she doesn't necessarily immerse herself in an imaginative world all the time. Given her focus on practicality and structure, a score of 3 seems most fitting, but leaning slightly towards a higher score due to her creative pursuits like gardening and mindfulness. Therefore, a score of 4 is a reasonable prediction."
