From my perspective, horror movies can be thrilling and engaging, but they can also be over-the-top or cliché.

I don’t think a horror movie would ever be so boring that it would cause boredom to death, but it could be less scary than intended.

While there may be quieter aircraft or newer technologies that reduce noise, the general perception of an aircraft engine is that it is loud.

I don't personally drink, and I don't think it's something I'd ever want to be associated with in a way that feels cringe.
