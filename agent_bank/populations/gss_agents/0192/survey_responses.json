            "BFI-10_1": "Rachel describes herself as a quiet person who is more interested in books than sports, and she doesn't feel the need to use social media or share her life online. She also mentions that she and her brother are 'pretty quiet and not the most talkative people.' These traits suggest that she is reserved and introspective, aligning more with the lower end of the range.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Rachel Johnson shows a strong sense of loyalty and trust in her family and close friends, such as her brother, her mother, and her coworkers. She also mentions feeling safe in her neighborhood and having a sense of community. However, she doesn't explicitly express a high level of trust in strangers or people outside her immediate circle. She seems cautious about her future and has a realistic, grounded view of life, which suggests she may not score very high on general trust.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Rachel Johnson describes herself as someone who works hard, takes responsibility for her family, and has a consistent routine at her job. She has also been helping her brother with his college applications and is actively trying to improve her health and well-being. These behaviors suggest she sees herself as proactive and responsible, not lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Rachel has mentioned feeling stress and anxiety, particularly around responsibilities like helping her brother with college applications and supporting her family. She also described feeling overwhelmed at times and has acknowledged that she tends to put others' needs before her own, which can contribute to stress. While she has started to develop coping strategies, such as mindfulness and talking to her mom, she hasn’t fully embraced them as a consistent part of her routine. This suggests she does not yet see herself as someone who handles stress well.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Rachel mentions her love for books and reading, which is a form of artistic or creative engagement. However, she does not express any interest in other artistic pursuits such as music, painting, or creative writing. Her life seems centered around practical responsibilities, family, and routine, which aligns more with having few artistic interests beyond reading.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Rachel describes herself as a quiet person who is more interested in books than sports and doesn't use social media much. She mentions that she prefers face-to-face interactions over online ones and that she is not the most talkative person. While she has close friends and a supportive network, she doesn't actively seek out social situations or describe herself as outgoing. Her personality seems more aligned with being reserved or introverted.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Rachel Johnson comes across as a person who is reflective, kind, and focused on supporting her family and friends. She shows empathy and understanding, especially when discussing her parents, brother, and coworkers. She does not exhibit tendencies to criticize or find fault with others. Instead, she often reflects on her own choices and growth, and she values the people around her. This suggests she is more likely to score low on this question.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Rachel consistently demonstrates responsibility, care, and attention to detail in her work at the bookstore, where she manages tasks like organizing shelves, assisting customers, and even leading storytime for kids. She also shows a strong sense of duty in helping her brother with college applications and supporting her family. These behaviors suggest she values thoroughness and takes pride in doing her best, even in small ways.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Rachel describes feeling a 'constant background worry' and mentions dealing with quiet anxiety, especially when overwhelmed with responsibilities or watching her brother's future unfold. She also mentions that she has been learning to prioritize her own well-being and that she has struggled with stress and feeling like she isn't moving forward fast enough. These reflections suggest she does experience nervousness or anxiety, though it's not overwhelming or debilitating.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Rachel mentions her love for books and reading, which suggests she engages with imaginative content regularly. However, she also describes herself as someone who values stability, responsibility, and practicality. While she has a quiet appreciation for books and storytelling, she doesn’t emphasize creativity or imagination as a defining trait of her personality. Her life seems more rooted in routine and real-world responsibilities than in abstract or imaginative pursuits."

She reflects on her life in a narrative, emotional, and introspective way, focusing on personal experiences and feelings rather than logical structures or data. She doesn’t mention engaging in analytical tasks or problem-solving in a structured way, and her responses are more intuitive and reflective in nature.",
            "REI_4": "Rachel Johnson demonstrates thoughtful consideration in her decisions, such as weighing the pros and cons of attending community college, reflecting on her life choices, and carefully helping her brother with his college applications.

She reflects on her life with a focus on personal growth, family support, and emotional resilience.

She also reflects on how she used to push through everything without taking time to breathe or rest. While she has started to practice mindfulness and talk more with her mom about her feelings, she still describes her stress as a 'steady hum' in the background of her life.

However, she also reflects on her life with a sense of acceptance and does not seem overly focused on perfection or detailed execution in all areas of her life.

            "BFI-10_1": "Rachel describes herself as a quiet person who prefers books over sports and is not the most talkative. She also mentions that she and her brother are 'quiet' and that she doesn't use social media much. Her introspective nature and tendency to reflect on her life and decisions suggest she aligns more with the reserved end of the spectrum.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Rachel Johnson describes her life as one of stability and support from her family and close friends.

Instead, she emphasizes her efforts to support her family and manage her responsibilities.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Rachel mentions experiencing stress and anxiety, particularly around responsibilities like helping her brother with college applications and financial concerns. She also acknowledges that she has been learning to manage stress better, such as through mindfulness and talking with her mom. However, she still feels the weight of responsibility and often puts others first, which suggests she does not handle stress effortlessly. While she is making progress, she does not yet seem to view herself as someone who is relaxed or handles stress well.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Rachel mentions enjoying books and reading, which is a form of artistic or creative engagement. However, she does not mention any other artistic interests such as music, painting, or other creative hobbies. Her focus is more on practical responsibilities, family, and work. While reading is an artistic activity, it is not explicitly framed as a central part of her identity in the interview. This suggests she may lean toward the lower end of the scale, but not strongly.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Rachel describes herself as a quiet person who prefers books over sports and doesn't engage much with social media.

She also mentions that she helps her brother with college applications and supports her family, showing a sense of responsibility and attention to detail in her actions.

            "BFI-10_9": "Rachel describes feeling a quiet anxiety, especially when things feel uncertain or when she's overwhelmed with responsibilities. She mentions feeling pressure to provide for her family and watching her own missed opportunities, which contributes to her sense of worry. While she doesn’t describe herself as someone who gets nervous easily, her reflections suggest she does experience anxiety, albeit in a more subdued and internalized way.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Rachel Johnson describes herself as someone who values reading and often spends time with books, which suggests some level of imagination. However, she also emphasizes practicality, responsibility, and routine in her life, such as working at the bookstore, helping her brother with college applications, and managing household responsibilities.
