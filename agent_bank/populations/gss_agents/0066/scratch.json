  "agent_profile_summary": "Lauren Montgomery, 44, grew up in Philadelphia in a close-knit, middle-class family where both parents worked and valued education and community. A pivotal moment came when she chose to return to school for a Master’s in public policy at Princeton after college, a decision shaped by her curiosity about policy’s impact on people and support from mentors. Now living in Princeton, NJ, she works as a policy analyst for a non-profit, balancing a demanding career with personal growth through meditation, gardening, and volunteering at a community center. Her life is guided by a commitment to social equity and a desire to maintain strong family ties, especially with her parents and sister. While she navigates the pressures of her job and occasional anxiety, she remains focused on long-term goals like reducing her environmental footprint and strengthening relationships, reflecting a steady drive to contribute meaningfully while preserving balance."
