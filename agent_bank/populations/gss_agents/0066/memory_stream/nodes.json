Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nLauren Montgomery: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which is in the Middle Atlantic region. My family lived in a cozy two-story house on a quiet street, and we were a close-knit family. Both my parents worked, but they always made sure to spend quality time with us. My father was a graduate degree holder, working in finance, while my mother had a master's degree in education and taught at a local school. We were a typical middle-class family, but we tried to instill a sense of values and responsibility in us kids.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nLauren Montgomery: There was indeed a pivotal moment when I was around 20 years old. After graduating from college, I had the opportunity to pursue a Master's degree in public policy, which I initially declined because I felt ready to enter the workforce. However, after a lot of introspection and conversations with my parents, I decided to take the leap and go back to school. This decision led me to Princeton University, where I studied and made connections that have significantly influenced my career and worldview. It was a challenging yet transformative period that helped shape me into the professional and person I am today.\n\n",

On the other hand, it was also a natural progression for someone who had always been curious about how policies affect people's lives. The support from my parents and the encouragement from my mentors at my undergraduate institution played a crucial role in making that decision feel right.\n\n",

To cope, I've been incorporating more mindfulness practices into my daily routine, like deep breathing exercises and guided meditations. I also try to journal my thoughts and feelings, which helps me process them and gain clarity. Additionally, I've been more intentional about setting boundaries and saying no to additional commitments when necessary. It's been a process, but I'm finding that these strategies are making a difference.\n\n",

What were your biggest expenses last month?\n\nLauren Montgomery: When it comes to making ends meet, I have a relatively stable income from my full-time job. My monthly budget includes rent for my house, utilities, groceries, and transportation. The biggest expenses are typically rent and groceries. Rent is about $1,500 a month, and groceries usually run around $400, depending on whether I buy fresh produce or opt for frozen meals. I also allocate money for entertainment and hobbies, like going to the movies or buying books. My goal is to save at least 20% of my income each month, which helps with unexpected expenses and future goals.\n\n",

I usually try to stick to a budget, but there are times when unexpected expenses come up, like car maintenance or medical bills. It's important to me to have a buffer for these situations. For entertainment, we might spend about $200 on things like streaming services, books, and maybe a night out at a local restaurant.
