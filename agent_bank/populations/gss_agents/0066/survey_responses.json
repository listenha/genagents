            "BFI-10_1": "Based on Lauren's interview, she seems to value her personal and professional growth, her close relationships with family and friends, and her ability to manage a balance between work and life. Given her mention of maintaining routines, setting boundaries, and her focus on mental health, it suggests she is someone who appreciates personal space and might feel more comfortable in smaller, intimate settings.
