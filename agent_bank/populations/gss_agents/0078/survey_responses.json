She doesn't explicitly claim to be exceptionally logical, but her work at a non-profit and her volunteer activities suggest she can handle complex tasks. However, she also mentions that she finds some aspects of her job challenging, indicating she might not view herself as outstandingly logical compared to others.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Miriam Yamamoto seems to have a balanced approach to problem-solving and decision-making. She has a graduate degree in public policy and works in a field that involves research and policy analysis, which requires logical thinking. However, she also engages in creative activities like art classes and fitness classes, indicating a more holistic approach to life. This suggests she is not overly analytical but still possesses a logical mind.

She reflects on her decisions and the impact they have, indicating that she considers her actions carefully. For example, she explains her career choice to work part-time at a non-profit and her involvement in various community activities. This suggests that she has clear reasons for her decisions.
