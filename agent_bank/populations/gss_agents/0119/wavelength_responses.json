It's not just numbers and formulas—it's about understanding systems, patterns, and how they apply to real life.

On the other hand, it could also lead to unintended consequences, such as job displacement or ethical issues, which I’ve witnessed in my community. My upbringing taught me the value of resilience and support systems, and I believe AGI’s impact will depend on how society chooses to guide and regulate it.

When it's done in moderation, with friends, and in a respectful setting, it can feel cool and social. However, when it's done excessively, inappropriately, or as a way to cope with stress, it can feel cringe. My own perspective is shaped by observing both sides—seeing people use drinking as a way to bond and also seeing it lead to awkward or negative situations.

It suggests a moment of solitude or introspection in a new place, which could imply a mix of curiosity and longing. While there is an element of being in a new city (which might suggest wanderlust), the mention of 'candle light' feels intimate and possibly reflective of a longing for home or comfort.
