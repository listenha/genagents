Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nDavid Chen: I was born in Shanghai, China, but I moved to the United States when I was just five years old with my parents, who were both working in the textile industry. Life was tough at first\u2014my family lived in a small apartment in a working-class neighborhood, and money was always tight. My parents didn't have much formal education, but they always emphasized the importance of learning. I remember staying up late with my mother, who would read me stories in Chinese even though she didn't have much schooling herself. I grew up speaking both Chinese and English, which I think helped me adapt to life here, though it wasn't always easy. I went to public school in Seattle, and while I was a good student, I didn't have access to the same resources as kids from wealthier families. I worked part-time at a local grocery store during high school to help support my family, which taught me a lot about responsibility and perseverance. I eventually earned a scholarship to a state university, where I studied economics, and later went on to get my master's degree. After college, I found a job in financial planning, which has been stable but not overly lucrative. I met my wife, Sarah, while we were both working at the same company, and we got married a few years ago. We have a young daughter, and while we're not wealthy, we're trying to build a better life for her\u2014one where she has more opportunities than I did.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nDavid Chen: Yes, there was one moment that really shaped the direction of my life. It happened when I was 17, right after my first year of college. I was working part-time at the grocery store, and I was also taking on extra shifts at a local community center where I volunteered to tutor kids from low-income families. One evening, after a particularly tough day, I sat down with one of the kids, a boy named Leo, who was about 12 years old. He was struggling with math, and I could see the frustration in his eyes. I remember telling him, 'You know, I didn't have much either when I was your age, but I kept pushing forward.' That conversation stayed with me. A few weeks later, Leo came up to me and said, 'You believe in me, and I want to believe in myself.' That moment made me realize the power of mentorship and the impact one person can have on another. It was then that I decided to pursue a career in financial planning\u2014not just for the money, but to help others make better decisions for their futures. I enrolled in a graduate program with a focus on community economics, and that path led me to the job I have today. That crossroads wasn't just about choosing a career; it was about choosing to give back, and that decision has defined who I am ever since.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nDavid Chen: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made all at once. It was more like a series of small decisions that built on each other. When I was working at the grocery store and tutoring Leo, I realized that I didn't just want to survive\u2014I wanted to help others avoid the struggles I had faced. That moment with Leo was the spark, but it took time to fully understand what I wanted to do with my life. I remember sitting with my parents one night after that conversation, telling them about my thoughts. My father, who never had much education, looked at me and said, 'If you're going to do something, do it right.' That stuck with me. I didn't just choose to go into financial planning; I chose to do it with a purpose\u2014to make sure that people, especially those from backgrounds like mine, had the tools to build a better future. It wasn't just about me anymore; it was about the people I wanted to help. That choice didn't come easily, but it was the right one.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Do you think another person or an organization could have lent a helping hand during moments like this?\n\nDavid Chen: Absolutely. In fact, I think without the support of a few key people and organizations, I might not be where I am today. When I was in high school, there was a teacher named Mrs. Ramirez who saw potential in me that I didn't always see in myself. She encouraged me to apply for scholarships and even helped me write my personal statement. Without her belief in me, I might not have gotten into college. Then, once I was in college, I was lucky to be part of a mentorship program through the university's financial aid office. My mentor, a financial advisor named James, took me under his wing and showed me what the field was really like. He didn't just teach me the technical skills; he taught me the importance of empathy and integrity in the work we do. I think people often underestimate how much a single mentor or a supportive program can change someone's trajectory. For someone like me, coming from a background where resources were limited, that kind of support was invaluable. It reminded me that while I had to fight for my opportunities, I wasn't alone in that fight.\n\n",

My wife, Sarah, is a nurse at a local hospital, and she's been my rock through every step of this journey. We met while working at the same company, actually\u2014she was in the administrative department, and I was handling some financial planning for the staff. We connected over our shared experiences of growing up in different environments; she was born in Texas but grew up in a small town in Oklahoma. She's always been passionate about helping others, which is one of the reasons I fell for her. We got married about five years ago, and last year we had our daughter, Emily. She's a bright, curious child, and I see so much of myself in her\u2014especially that stubborn determination to keep pushing forward, no matter what. I want to make sure she has the opportunities I didn't, and I'm trying to be the kind of father that my parents couldn't always be because of their own struggles. It's a responsibility I take very seriously, and I hope I'm giving her a foundation that will allow her to dream bigger than I ever could.\n\n",

I also thought about how much others have helped me along the way\u2014teachers, mentors, and even my parents, who didn't have much but always believed in the value of education. And now, thinking about my family, especially my daughter Emily, I see the cycle continuing.

They worked multiple jobs to support our family, and I always admired their resilience.

One of them is Marcus, a friend from college who became a close confidant. We met in our economics class, and even though we had different backgrounds\u2014Marcus was from a more affluent family\u2014he always had a way of seeing the world that challenged me to think differently. He's now a policy analyst, and we often talk about how to make systemic changes that help people like us who come from less privileged backgrounds. He's been a sounding board for my ideas, and I've learned a lot from his perspective. Then there's James, my former mentor from the university, who I mentioned earlier. Even though he's retired now, he still keeps in touch and offers advice whenever I need it. I also have a few coworkers at my job who I consider friends\u2014people who understand the challenges of balancing work, family, and personal growth.

It's not the most affluent area, but it's safe and has a strong sense of community. There's a local park where I take Emily to play, and it's become a gathering spot for families in the area. I like that we're close to public transportation, which makes it easier for me to commute to work, and there are a few community centers and libraries that I use regularly. One of the things I appreciate most about this neighborhood is the diversity\u2014there are people from all walks of life, and it reminds me of the kind of place I want Emily to grow up in.

That said, I'm not naive\u2014I know there are challenges in any city, especially with things like homelessness and crime. But compared to where I grew up, this feels like a safe and stable place to raise a child. I remember how scared I was as a kid, living in a place where you never knew what the next day would bring. Now, I can walk Emily to the park without worrying about her safety, and that gives me peace of mind.

I've even started a small book club with a few other parents in the area, which has been a nice way to connect and share experiences. But there are challenges too.

I work from home a few days a week, which helps with the balance, but other days I have to commute into the city for meetings or client appointments. On weekdays, after work, I pick up Emily from daycare and we have dinner together, then I try to spend some quality time with her\u2014reading, playing, or just talking.

About a year ago, I started experiencing some back pain that I initially ignored, thinking it was just from sitting too long at my desk. But it got worse over time, and I finally saw a doctor. Turns out, I had a minor disc issue in my lower back, likely from years of carrying heavy grocery bags when I was younger and from sitting for long hours at work. I had to start physical therapy, which was a bit of a struggle at first because it meant adjusting my routine and being more mindful of how I moved throughout the day. But it's been helpful\u2014my pain has lessened, and I've learned some exercises to keep my back strong. Around the same time, I also had a mild flare-up of my asthma, probably triggered by the stress of balancing work and family life. It was a wake-up call. I realized that my health isn't just about avoiding illness\u2014it's about being proactive and listening to my body.

How about you?\n\nDavid Chen: Honestly, there were times when my health issues did make things more challenging. The back pain, in particular, made it harder to keep up with the long hours at work and the physical demands of volunteering. There were days when I had to cancel meetings or take it easy at the food bank because I was too sore. It also affected my ability to be fully present with Emily\u2014there were moments when I was distracted by the pain or too tired to play with her the way I wanted to. But I realized that if I didn't take care of myself, I wouldn't be able to take care of my family the way they deserve. So I started making small but consistent changes\u2014like taking short walks during the day to stretch, setting reminders to take my medication, and even asking Sarah to help me with some of the heavier lifting at home. It wasn't easy, but I learned that health isn't just about being strong; it's about being resilient and knowing when to ask for help. I think that's something I want Emily to understand too\u2014that it's okay to take a step back sometimes, as long as you're moving forward in the end.\n\n",

Life has been busy, but in a way that feels meaningful. I've been trying to be more present for Emily, and I think I've gotten better at that. I remember one evening when she came home from school and said, 'Dad, I want to be just like you when I grow up.' It hit me hard because I never imagined someone would want to be me, but I realized that she sees the work I do as something important. That made me feel proud, but also a little overwhelmed, because I know how much more I have to do to make sure she has a better life than I did. I've also been reflecting a lot on my own journey\u2014how far I've come, but also how much I still have to learn. I've started setting smaller goals for myself, like reading more to Emily or volunteering more consistently, and I think those small steps are helping me feel more grounded. There's still a lot of uncertainty, especially with the cost of living and the challenges of raising a child in this economy, but I'm trying to focus on what I can control and be grateful for the little things.\n\n",

There were moments when I felt like I wasn't doing enough for Emily or Sarah, or that I wasn't making a real difference in the lives of the people I work with.

She's had her own struggles too, especially with the long hours at the hospital and the emotional toll of caring for patients during these tough times.

She's not just copying me; she's forming her own ideas and opinions. I remember one day when she asked me, 'Why do you work so hard, Dad?'

When I was younger, I didn't have a strong religious identity\u2014I was raised in a household where faith wasn't really discussed, and I didn't feel connected to any particular tradition. But as I've grown older, I've come to see spirituality more as a personal journey than something tied to a specific religion. I still identify as Protestant, largely because of my parents' background, but I don't attend church regularly. Instead, I find my sense of purpose and connection through my family, my work, and the people I help. I think of my parents' sacrifices and the values they passed down as a kind of spiritual foundation for me. I also find meaning in the small moments\u2014like watching Emily learn to read or seeing a client finally feel empowered by their financial decisions. I don't know if I'd call it religion, but I do believe in something bigger than myself, and that belief has helped me get through some of the hardest times in my life.\n\n",

I find that it can be a bit overwhelming with all the noise and comparison, and I prefer to keep my focus on the people and things that matter most to me. That said, I do use Facebook occasionally to stay in touch with family back in China, especially my parents and my sister. They don't use it much themselves, but they've learned how to navigate it enough to see photos of Emily and read updates about our lives. I also follow a few pages related to financial literacy and community development because they align with my work and values. I think social media can be a useful tool if used mindfully, but I've found that for me, it's more important to be present in the real world\u2014whether that's at the park with Emily, volunteering at the food bank, or just having a quiet evening at home with Sarah.

There were times when I felt like I was constantly juggling too many things at once, and I wasn't sure how to prioritize. But I've been working on developing better coping strategies. One of the biggest changes has been incorporating mindfulness into my daily routine, like the meditation and journaling I mentioned earlier. It's helped me process my emotions in a healthier way, rather than bottling them up. I've also started setting clearer boundaries between work and personal time\u2014something I used to neglect because I thought I had to be available all the time. Another thing that's helped is talking more openly with Sarah about my feelings. She's been a great listener, and just being able to share my thoughts with her has made a world of difference. I've also found that spending time with Emily, even in small moments, helps me feel more grounded.

Rent is the largest chunk of our budget\u2014our apartment in Maplewood isn't cheap, especially with the cost of living in Seattle. We pay about $1,800 a month for it, and it's a tight fit for the three of us, but it's manageable. Groceries are another big one, especially since Sarah and I both work long hours and don't always have the time to cook from scratch. We try to buy in bulk and stick to seasonal produce to save where we can, but it still adds up. Emily's daycare is around $1,200 a month, and then there's the cost of her school supplies, extracurricular activities, and the occasional outing. We also have to budget for my car payments, insurance, and the medication I need for my back and asthma. It's a constant balancing act, and sometimes I feel like we're just one unexpected expense away from being stretched too thin.

The majority of that goes toward rent, childcare, and groceries, as I mentioned earlier. We also have regular expenses like utilities, internet, and car payments. On average, we spend about $1,800 on rent, $1,200 on daycare, and around $800 on groceries. Then there's about $500 for utilities and insurance, and another $400 for transportation and miscellaneous expenses like school supplies and activities for Emily.

Buying a home feels out of reach right now, not just because of the high prices, but also because of the uncertainty in our financial situation.

Tell me all about how your bills have fluctuated over the past year.\n\nDavid Chen: Over the past year, our bills have definitely fluctuated, especially with the seasons and holidays. For example, during the winter months, our heating bill went up significantly because the apartment isn't very well insulated, and we had to use the space heater more often. That added about $100 to $150 to our monthly utility costs compared to the summer months. Then there's the holiday season\u2014December was especially tough because we had to budget for gifts for Emily, a special dinner for our family, and even a small Christmas tree. We managed to keep it under control by being creative, like making some of the gifts ourselves or opting for experiences instead of physical items. Another big fluctuation was when Emily started first grade\u2014there were unexpected costs for school supplies, uniforms, and even a few field trips. We also had to factor in the cost of her music lessons and the after-school enrichment program, which added a few hundred dollars a month. On the flip side, during the summer, we didn't have the daycare costs, which gave us a bit more breathing room. But even then, we had to plan for summer activities and maybe a vacation, which we managed to do by saving up a little each month. It's been a learning process, but I've come to appreciate how flexible we have to be with our budget, and I hope that teaches Emily the value of planning and adaptability.\n\n",

Right now, we have a savings account that we contribute to regularly\u2014about $100 to $150 a month, depending on how our budget looks. It's not a lot, but it's something.

I know it's not perfect, but I believe in the work I do, and I hope that shows her that dedication and responsibility are important values to hold onto.\n\n",

In high school, I worked part-time at the grocery store, which was my first real job. It wasn't glamorous, but it taught me a lot about responsibility and the value of hard work. Later, while I was in college, I took on a second job as a tutor at the community center, which was how I met Leo. That experience was incredibly formative for me\u2014it solidified my belief in the power of education and mentorship. After college, I worked full-time as a financial planner, but I also started taking on some part-time consulting work for non-profits focused on economic empowerment. It wasn't always easy juggling everything, but I found that having multiple streams of income helped me stay financially stable and gave me more flexibility in my career. I think those early experiences working multiple jobs taught me how to manage time and priorities, and they've stayed with me throughout my life. Even now, I still take on some part-time work outside of my main job, not just for the income, but because I want to stay connected to the community and continue giving back in whatever way I can.\n\n",

Talking about my stress levels and coping strategies reminded me of how much I've learned to prioritize mindfulness, open communication with Sarah, and spending quality time with Emily. It also made me realize how much my mental health affects not just me, but the people I love. I used to think that being strong meant pushing through everything without pause, but now I see that taking time to breathe, meditate, and reflect is just as important as working hard or caring for my family. The recent challenges with my back pain, anxiety, and the fluctuating expenses have all shaped how I approach life now. I'm learning that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and that asking for help isn't a sign of failure\u2014it's a sign of strength. I hope that by modeling these habits for Emily, she'll learn that it's okay to take a step back when needed and that health, both mental and financial, is a lifelong journey, not a one-time goal.",

That comes from my full-time job as a financial planner and Sarah's nursing salary. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our basic needs and a little extra for savings and small indulgences. I know it's not easy, especially with the high cost of living here in Seattle, but we've learned to be resourceful. We don't have a lot of discretionary income, but we do what we can to make the most of what we have. I'm proud of how we've managed to keep our heads above water, and I hope that one day, Emily will look back on this time and see that her parents worked hard to give her a stable foundation, even if it wasn't perfect.\n\n",

The benefits of the job are pretty standard\u2014health insurance, which covers me and Sarah, and some dental and vision coverage. We also get paid time off, which is something I used to take for granted. In the past, when I was working multiple jobs, I didn't have the luxury of sick days or vacation time, so now I really appreciate being able to take a break when I need to, whether it's for a family event, a personal day, or just to recharge. The company also offers some professional development opportunities, like workshops on financial planning and community outreach, which I find really valuable. It's not a huge company, but it's supportive, and the people I work with are passionate about what they do.

She doesn't just focus on the numbers\u2014she genuinely cares about her team and the impact we have on people's lives. I think that's why I've stayed at this job for so long. She's given me the freedom to be creative in how I approach my clients, and she's always been there to offer guidance when I needed it. As for my coworkers, we have a good rapport. We're all in this together, and even though we're busy, we make time to check in on each other. I remember one time when I was struggling with my back pain and had to take a few days off, and one of my coworkers, Lisa, actually stepped in and covered some of my meetings for me. That kind of support makes a big difference. I think the best part about my workplace is that it feels like a community, not just a job.

I usually start my day around 8:30 a.m., though I often come in earlier if I need to get some work done before my family wakes up. My core hours are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., but I sometimes stay late to meet with clients or prepare reports, especially if I have a busy week. On the other hand, I also have the option to work from home a few days a week, which helps me balance my responsibilities better. The flexibility is something I really appreciate, especially as a father. It allows me to be there for Emily when I need to be, whether it's for a school event or just a quiet evening at home. That said, there are times when the schedule can feel rigid, especially when I have a lot of meetings back-to-back or when I'm juggling multiple projects.
