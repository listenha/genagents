            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Antonio Garcia does not seem to fit the description of someone who is outgoing and sociable. He mentions having a close-knit group of friends, but he also describes himself as someone who maintains a balance between his work and personal life, which suggests he is more reserved and prefers not to be the center of attention all the time. Additionally, his focus on personal growth and maintaining a sense of stability in his life indicates that he values privacy and may be more reserved in nature.",

His willingness to take risks and pursue higher education and a challenging career suggests he is somewhat trusting of opportunities and people. However, his conservative views and emphasis on caution in his upbringing indicate he might not be overly trusting of everyone or every situation.
