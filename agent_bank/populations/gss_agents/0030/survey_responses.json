            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen seems to value her privacy and personal space, especially when discussing her early life and the challenges of adapting to a new country. Her decision to apply for the scholarship and the subsequent transition to university suggest she was open to new experiences and challenges, which indicates a certain level of adaptability and sociability. However, she also emphasizes the importance of inner peace and maintaining personal relationships, which suggests she is not overly extroverted. Therefore, a middle ground of 3 seems appropriate, but given the range, 1 is a safer choice as it aligns more closely with her preference for introspection and maintaining personal space.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen seems to be someone who values giving back to her community and has participated in various community activities and projects. This suggests she is open to trusting others and forming meaningful connections. Additionally, she mentions being open to the possibility of starting a family someday, which indicates a willingness to trust and rely on others. These factors point towards a more trusting nature.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen appears to be a proactive and goal-oriented individual. She describes herself as someone who makes deliberate choices and takes action to improve her life and community. Her involvement in community work, professional achievements, and efforts to balance her personal and professional life suggest she is not someone who would consider themselves lazy. Furthermore, her emphasis on self-care and finding ways to manage stress indicates a level of motivation and self-discipline.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen describes herself as someone who is busy and faces significant work and community-related stress. However, she mentions that she has developed coping mechanisms like yoga, meditation, and maintaining a balanced routine, which suggests she is capable of handling stress. She also notes that she tries to find ways to manage her stress, such as participating in community activities and keeping a balanced lifestyle. While she acknowledges the challenges, her efforts to manage stress indicate a higher level of relaxation and stress handling compared to someone who would choose 1.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen has expressed an interest in reading and trying different cuisines, which are forms of artistic expression, albeit in more passive and culinary contexts. She has also mentioned participating in community health groups and trying yoga and meditation, which involve some form of artistic or expressive activity. While her involvement in these activities seems to be more about physical well-being and community service than traditional artistic pursuits, she does have some engagement with creative and expressive activities. Given this, it seems unlikely that she would strongly identify with having few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen mentioned having close friends and participating in community activities. She also talked about her relationships with colleagues and friends, indicating she enjoys social interactions.

            "BFI-10_8": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen appears to be a person who is dedicated to her work and community. She mentions engaging in various professional and community activities, which suggests she is committed and thorough in her work. Additionally, her emphasis on self-care, emotional resilience, and maintaining a balanced lifestyle indicates a level of conscientiousness and attention to detail. This aligns more with someone who values thoroughness in their work.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen seems to be a resilient individual who has faced numerous challenges and has managed to navigate them successfully. She describes herself as someone who finds ways to cope with stress and has developed strategies to deal with the pressures of her work and community involvements. This suggests she is more likely to fall into the lower end of the range, indicating she does not get nervous easily.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen does not seem to be a particularly imaginative person. She describes her life in a rather straightforward manner, focusing on practical matters such as work, community service, and family. She does not mention engaging in creative activities or having a vivid imagination. Therefore, it is more likely that she would rate herself lower on the scale of having an active imagination."

She has a strong desire to help others and gives back to her community. This suggests that she would be able to understand and share in her friends' happiness when they achieve something. Furthermore, her close relationships with her family and friends indicate a high level of emotional connection and understanding. Therefore, she is more likely to choose a higher number on the scale.",
            "BES-A_2": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen is described as having close relationships with her friends and being involved in community work. This suggests she is likely to be attuned to the emotions of others, making it less likely for her to choose 5. Furthermore, she mentions the importance of support from friends in her life, indicating she is empathetic and perceptive. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume she would find it easier to know when her friends are frightened.",
            "BES-A_3": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen seems to be a thoughtful and caring individual who has experienced her own share of challenges and emotions. She mentions practices like journaling and seeking support from friends to cope with stress, indicating a level of empathy and emotional awareness.

She mentions having close friends and a mentor, indicating she likely has good social skills and can understand and connect with others. Additionally, she talks about her work and community involvement, suggesting she engages with a variety of people. This suggests she would be more attuned to the emotions of her friends, but probably not to the extent that she would score a 5. A score of 3 seems reasonable, reflecting a moderate ability to recognize fear in friends, but without overstating her skill.",
            "BES-A_5": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen seems to have a strong sense of empathy and emotional intelligence. She mentions using social media for emotional support and regularly engaging in activities like yoga and meditation to manage her own emotions. These traits suggest she is attuned to the emotions of others and can often understand how people are feeling without them explicitly telling her. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that she would choose a higher number on this scale.",
            "BES-A_6": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen comes across as someone who is deeply engaged with her community and relationships. She mentions actively participating in community health groups and volunteering, which suggests she is attentive to the emotions and needs of others. Additionally, she talks about seeking support through social media and sharing her experiences with friends, indicating a level of empathy and understanding of others' feelings. This aligns more closely with someone who can usually work out when people are cheerful.",

She has close relationships with friends and colleagues, and actively participates in community activities. Her openness to sharing her experiences and emotions suggests she is attentive to the feelings of others.

However, she mentions that her parents were not very educated and that she faced significant challenges adapting to a new country. While she has achieved a lot, the interview does not suggest that she feels overly confident in her ability to solve complex problems. Her focus on community work and her willingness to apply for scholarships indicate a pragmatic approach rather than a confident one. Therefore, it is more likely that she would identify herself as someone who is not that good at figuring out complicated problems.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen has a background of facing significant challenges and making deliberate decisions that led to her success. She emphasizes her commitment to giving back to her community and her appreciation for her family's support. Given her resilience and the fact that she has navigated a variety of challenges, it is unlikely that she would agree with this statement strongly. However, since she does not explicitly mention excelling at logical analysis, a middle-ground seems most appropriate.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen has demonstrated a willingness to engage in complex tasks like market analysis and product promotion. She also appears to be well-versed in understanding market trends and customer feedback, which suggests she has analytical skills. However, she does not explicitly describe herself as an analytical thinker and seems more focused on her emotional connections and community work.

She mentions making deliberate choices, such as applying for the scholarship, which suggests she values careful reasoning. Additionally, she talks about the importance of community support and maintaining a balanced life, indicating a thoughtful approach to her commitments. However, her responses also show a blend of intentional and serendipitous moments, suggesting she isn't purely methodical in her decision-making process. Given these factors, it seems she leans more towards valuing careful reasoning, but still acknowledges that she doesn't excel at it.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen describes her work as demanding and mentions the need to be efficient and handle projects with tight deadlines. However, she also mentions that she practices yoga and meditation to manage stress, indicating a certain level of resilience. Given her efforts to maintain balance and manage stress, it seems unlikely that she would rate herself as 1. On the other hand, her profession and the challenges she faces suggest that she can handle pressure to some extent, but she may not be completely unflustered. Therefore, a moderate score seems appropriate.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen appears to be a reflective and thoughtful individual, but she does not emphasize exceptional logical reasoning skills. She discusses her work in market analysis and product promotion, indicating a practical and strategic mindset, but without highlighting extraordinary logical prowess. Her emphasis on community involvement and balancing different aspects of her life suggests a more balanced and holistic approach rather than a focus on superior logical abilities.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen seems to be a logical and analytical individual. She discusses her work as a marketing analyst and product manager, which requires strong logical reasoning and critical thinking skills. She also mentions engaging in activities like yoga and meditation, which can enhance cognitive functions and logical thinking. Furthermore, her ability to manage a balanced lifestyle and handle multiple responsibilities suggests a strong logical mind.",
            "REI_8": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen comes across as a reflective and goal-oriented individual. She mentions making deliberate choices, such as applying for the scholarship and balancing her career and community work. Her statements indicate a preference for careful thought and planning. Additionally, she values learning and growth, which suggests a thoughtful approach to her actions and decisions.",
            "REI_9": "Based on the interview, Mei Chen seems to be someone who values logical thinking and enjoys analyzing situations. She has described her work as involving market analysis and product promotion, which requires a lot of logical and analytical skills. Additionally, she has mentioned engaging in activities like yoga and meditation, which can enhance mental clarity and logical thought processes. This suggests she is likely to be someone who finds logic useful in problem-solving.",
            "REI_10": "From the interview, Mei Chen describes her decisions as a combination of both deliberate and serendipitous choices. She acknowledges that while she believes in making conscious decisions, she also recognizes that sometimes things fall into place in a way that seems destined. This suggests that she leans more towards the middle to higher end of the scale but is not entirely confident in always having clear, explainable reasons."

She emphasizes the importance of hard work, resilience, and giving back to her community. Her descriptions suggest a thoughtful and deliberate approach to life rather than being overly extroverted or reserved. While she has a close network of friends and supports from her community, she does not explicitly describe herself as someone who prefers solitude or is hesitant to engage socially.

She also notes that while her stress levels can rise during work and community activities, she actively works on coping strategies. This suggests she is relatively relaxed and manages stress reasonably well, but may not consider herself to be extremely relaxed compared to everyone else.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the information provided in the interview, Mei Chen does not seem to have a strong connection with artistic interests. She mentions having hobbies like reading and cooking, but does not indicate a significant engagement in artistic activities.

These experiences suggest she is adaptable and resourceful, qualities that can be associated with an active imagination. However, she also emphasizes the importance of balance and grounding herself in reality, which indicates she is not purely imaginative but rather practical.
