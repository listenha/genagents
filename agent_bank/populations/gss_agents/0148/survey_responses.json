            "BFI-10_1": "Lauren describes herself as a 'quiet kid' who wasn't the most outgoing and still reflects on how she 'wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life until I got to high school.' She also mentions that she 'wasn't sure what I wanted to study yet' and 'still dreams about going back to school someday.' These statements suggest a tendency to be introspective and cautious, aligning with a more reserved self-perception.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Lauren describes herself as someone who puts others first, supports her family, and has a strong sense of gratitude for the people in her life. She also mentions being close to her mother, sister, and coworkers, and values connection with others. While she has experienced challenges and stress, she shows a tendency to trust and rely on her family and friends, which suggests a moderate to high level of trust in others.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Lauren describes herself as someone who works full-time, helps her mother with her teaching duties, takes online courses, and is actively trying to improve her life. She is conscious of her responsibilities and is making efforts to move forward, even if it’s slow. She does not exhibit behaviors or self-perceptions that align with laziness.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Lauren has spoken openly about her struggles with anxiety and stress, including chronic back pain, migraines, and the emotional weight of balancing family responsibilities with her own goals. She has also mentioned feeling stuck and overwhelmed at times, and while she is making progress in developing coping strategies, she still describes days when she feels like she is going through the motions. This suggests she does not see herself as someone who handles stress well, but she is working on it.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Lauren mentions that she enjoys reading and writing, and she even took online writing courses to pursue her creative side. She also describes herself as someone who 'still feels connected to who I used to be, before I got caught up in all the responsibilities,' which suggests that she has a meaningful artistic interest in writing. This indicates that she would not rate herself as having 'few artistic interests.'",
            "BFI-10_6": "Lauren describes herself as a 'quiet kid' who wasn't the most outgoing. She also mentions that she's not sure what she wants to do with her life and has been focused on work and family responsibilities. While she has a few close friends and coworkers, she doesn't appear to be someone who actively seeks out social interactions or enjoys being the center of attention. Her reflections suggest she is more introspective and cautious in her social interactions.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Lauren describes herself as someone who puts others first, supports her family, and is grateful for the people in her life. She shows empathy and understanding, particularly toward her mother, father, and sister. She does not express any tendencies to find fault with others or to be critical of them. Instead, she reflects on her own struggles and the sacrifices of her family with gratitude and compassion.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Lauren describes her work at the bookstore as steady and reliable, and she takes pride in doing her job well. She mentions that she is a 'reliable part of the team' and that she 'takes pride in doing my job well.' These statements suggest that she sees herself as someone who is careful and committed to her responsibilities, which aligns with a higher score on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Lauren has discussed her struggles with anxiety, particularly in the past few years, and has mentioned feeling overwhelmed by responsibilities and the weight of expectations. She also described having migraines and back pain that made it harder to focus, which could contribute to feelings of nervousness. While she has been working on coping strategies, she still acknowledges the emotional toll of her situation, which aligns more with the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Lauren mentions her love for reading and writing, which are strongly tied to imagination. She also reflects on her childhood as a 'quiet kid' who 'loved reading and writing,' and she has recently started taking online writing courses. These details suggest she engages with imaginative and creative activities, even if she hasn't pursued them fully. Her introspective nature and connection to stories also indicate an active imagination."

She also reflects on the importance of emotional support and understanding in her life, which suggests she is able to empathize with others' emotions and happiness.",
            "BES-A_2": "Lauren describes herself as a quiet, introspective person who has often prioritized others' needs over her own. She has a close relationship with her sister and a few friends, but she doesn't mention being particularly attuned to the emotional states of others. She also doesn't express a strong ability to read people's emotions or react to them. Based on her self-described personality and lack of explicit evidence of high emotional awareness, it's more likely she would score lower on this question.",
            "BES-A_3": "Lauren has shown a clear ability to reflect on her own emotions, struggles, and the emotional states of her family members. She acknowledges her anxiety, her family's sacrifices, and her own emotional growth. She also expresses understanding of her mother's stress and her sister's challenges, showing she can relate to others' feelings. This suggests she has a strong capacity for empathy and emotional understanding.",
            "BES-A_4": "Lauren describes herself as someone who is quiet, introspective, and often puts others first. While she is supportive of her family and friends, she also acknowledges feeling stuck in her own life and struggling with anxiety and self-doubt. She doesn't explicitly mention being the one to comfort others during fear, but she does show care and support for her family and friends. However, she also seems to be more focused on her own struggles and growth, which may suggest she is less likely to see herself as someone who can reliably comfort others in fear.",
            "BES-A_5": "Lauren describes herself as a quiet, introspective person who often reflects on her own emotions and the emotions of her family. She is deeply connected to her mother and sister, and she is aware of their struggles and emotions. However, she does not explicitly mention being able to sense others' feelings before they are expressed. Her introspection and emotional awareness suggest she may have some empathy, but she is not described as highly perceptive of others’ emotions in real-time.",
            "BES-A_6": "Lauren describes herself as a quiet, introspective person who often feels like she is 'going through the motions' and has struggled with anxiety and stress. She also mentions feeling overwhelmed by her responsibilities and not always being in a place where she feels energized. This suggests she may not be someone who is naturally energized by others' cheerfulness, especially in the context of physical activity.",
            "BES-A_7": "Lauren describes herself as a quiet, introspective person who has often prioritized others' needs over her own. While she has close friends and is emotionally aware in her own life, she does not emphasize being particularly attuned to others' emotions in the interview. She reflects more on her own feelings and struggles than on her ability to interpret others’ emotions quickly.",
            "BES-A_8": "Lauren describes having close friends from high school, such as Jamie and Marcus, with whom she maintains regular contact. She mentions that Jamie encouraged her to consider returning to school and that Marcus has been a support system. This suggests that she is aware of her friends' feelings and values their input. She also reflects on the importance of her relationships and the support she receives from others, indicating a level of emotional awareness and connection.",
            "BES-A_9": "Lauren describes herself as a quiet, introspective person who has not always been open about her struggles or emotions. While she has close friends and values relationships, she has not explicitly mentioned being highly attuned to others' emotions. Her focus has been more on her own challenges, family, and work, which suggests she may not be as in tune with her friends' emotional states as someone who is more socially engaged or empathetic."

While she has taken steps like enrolling in online courses and setting goals, she also mentions feeling overwhelmed by her health, financial situation, and the weight of responsibility. This suggests a degree of self-perceived limitation in handling complex problems, especially when life feels heavy and uncertain.",
            "REI_2": "Lauren mentions she has struggled with anxiety and stress, and while she has been working on coping strategies like journaling and setting small goals, there is no indication that she has strong confidence in her ability to solve complex logical problems. She has focused more on emotional and practical challenges rather than analytical or logical ones. Her narrative suggests she may not see herself as someone who excels in logical analysis.",
            "REI_3": "Lauren describes herself as someone who values connection, emotional support, and small, personal moments over structured or logical processes. She reflects on her life with a focus on emotional and relational experiences, and she often emphasizes feeling, intuition, and the support of others rather than breaking down problems into logical components. She does not mention any strong preference for analytical thinking or problem-solving in her work or personal life.",
            "REI_4": "Lauren demonstrates thoughtful reflection throughout the interview, often weighing her options and considering the long-term implications of her decisions. She reflects on her past choices, her current life situation, and her future goals with a great deal of care and consideration. This suggests that she does value and engage in careful reasoning, even if she sometimes feels uncertain or stuck.",
            "REI_5": "Lauren has described experiencing anxiety and stress, particularly related to her health, financial situation, and life decisions. She has mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times and struggling with chronic issues like migraines and back pain, which can impair her ability to think clearly. While she is resilient and determined, her interview suggests that pressure—whether from work, health, or life circumstances—does affect her, aligning more with a higher score on this scale.",
            "REI_6": "Lauren describes herself as someone who often feels stuck, reflects deeply on her decisions, and tends to be introspective and emotional in her thinking. She mentions feeling overwhelmed by life's pressures and has not pursued formal education or career paths that require strong logical reasoning. Her decision-making process seems more intuitive and emotionally driven, as seen in her reflections on family, health, and life choices.",
            "REI_7": "Lauren describes herself as someone who is reflective, values personal connections, and has often made decisions based on emotional and familial considerations rather than strict logic. She also mentions moments of uncertainty and introspection, which suggest she may lean more toward intuition and emotional reasoning than strict logic. While she is thoughtful and organized in her daily routines, there is no explicit mention of her relying on logic as a defining trait.",
            "REI_8": "Lauren demonstrates a tendency to think carefully about her decisions, as seen in her reflection on her choice to work full-time after high school rather than attend college. She often weighs options, considers the impact on her family, and reflects on her life choices in detail. This suggests she values careful thought and deliberation.",
            "REI_9": "Lauren describes herself as someone who often feels stuck in life, struggles with anxiety, and has made decisions based on emotional and familial responsibilities rather than logical analysis. She reflects on her life with a sense of uncertainty and has not pursued structured paths like college or career advancement. Her decision-making seems more intuitive and influenced by emotional factors, such as putting her family first at 19. This suggests she may not rely heavily on logic to solve problems in her life.",
            "REI_10": "Lauren reflects on her decisions with a great deal of thought and consideration, especially when it comes to major life choices, such as whether to go to college or stay with her family. She often weighs the pros and cons of her options and acknowledges the reasoning behind her decisions, even when they were difficult. However, she also expresses uncertainty and hesitation, which may suggest that she doesn't always feel fully confident in her reasoning. Still, her introspective nature and ability to articulate the reasons behind her choices lean her toward a higher score."

While she has close relationships with her mother and a few friends, she has not mentioned having a romantic partner or engaging in many social interactions beyond her immediate family and coworkers. She also expressed a tendency to carry emotional burdens and put others first, which may suggest a cautious or guarded approach to trust. However, she has also shown vulnerability and openness in the interview, especially when discussing her mental health and family dynamics, which could indicate a more trusting nature.",

Instead, she appears to be someone who is working hard and striving to move forward, even if progress is slow.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Lauren has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, migraines, and chronic back pain, which have made it harder for her to manage stress. She also mentioned that she used to push through everything without asking for help, which suggests she hasn't always handled stress well. However, she has started to develop better coping strategies, like journaling and being more open with her family. While she is making progress, her overall narrative suggests she still finds stress management challenging.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Lauren mentions that she enjoys reading and writing, and she even took online writing courses to explore her creative side. She also describes herself as someone who 'keeps her creative side alive' through freelance writing. This suggests she has at least some artistic interest, though it may not be a central part of her identity.",

However, she doesn't show a high level of emotional insight into others' feelings, which would be needed for a score of 5. A score of 3 seems more likely, as she is socially engaged but doesn't demonstrate deep emotional awareness of others' moods."

However, she also mentions feeling stuck and uncertain about her future, which may suggest a cautious or skeptical outlook in other areas of her life.

She also described her job at the bookstore as a place where she can 'lose myself in stories,' indicating an appreciation for literature and creative expression.

            "BFI-10_6": "Lauren describes herself as a quiet kid who wasn't the most outgoing, and she hasn't changed much in that regard. She values connection but doesn't seek out large social situations or enjoy being the center of attention.

She has described feeling stuck, carrying the weight of her family's needs, and dealing with chronic migraines and back pain. These factors, combined with her reflections on emotional coping strategies and the need to ask for support, suggest she sees herself as someone who gets nervous easily.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Lauren mentions her love for reading and writing, and she often reflects on stories and possibilities in her life. She also engages in creative writing on the side and has a deep appreciation for the stories she reads at the bookstore. These all suggest a strong imagination. However, she also describes feeling stuck and having to focus on practical matters, which might slightly temper her self-perception of imagination. Still, the presence of her creative pursuits and her reflection on her own life as a narrative strongly aligns with a higher score."

Her self-described quiet determination and tendency to put others first may also contribute to feeling overwhelmed in high-stress situations.",
            "REI_6": "Lauren describes herself as someone who often feels stuck, makes decisions based on immediate needs (like supporting her family), and reflects deeply on her emotions and relationships. She doesn't emphasize logical or analytical thinking as a core strength. Instead, she focuses on emotional resilience, family, and small, incremental progress. This suggests she would not see herself as particularly strong in logical reasoning compared to others.",
            "REI_7": "Lauren describes herself as someone who values connection, emotional support, and small acts of kindness. She reflects on her life with a focus on personal relationships, emotional well-being, and her family's influence.

She also mentions struggling with anxiety and feeling overwhelmed by life's pressures, which suggests she may not always rely on logic to navigate problems. Her narrative emphasizes emotional and relational factors over analytical reasoning.",
            "REI_10": "Lauren reflects on her decisions, particularly the one she made at 19 to forgo college and take a full-time job to support her family. She describes this as a conscious choice, even if it felt like it 'just happened.' This shows she is capable of reflecting on and explaining her decisions, even if they were influenced by external factors. She also acknowledges the reasoning behind her choices, such as financial necessity and family support. However, she also expresses uncertainty and wonder about what could have been, which suggests that not all her decisions feel entirely clear or explainable to her."

She doesn't use social media much and tends to be introspective, which aligns with being reserved. She also mentions feeling like she's been holding everything in for a long time, which supports the idea that she sees herself as reserved.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Lauren describes herself as someone who values connection deeply and finds strength in her family and small acts of kindness. She also mentions that she is still working toward her own future and has a strong sense of gratitude for the support she receives from her family and friends. These traits suggest that she is generally trusting of others, especially those close to her. However, she also mentions feeling stuck and uncertain about her future, which might indicate some hesitation or wariness in trusting others outside of her immediate circle. Still, the overall tone of her interview suggests a more trusting and connected personality.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Lauren describes herself as someone who works full-time, helps her mother with grading, takes online writing courses, and actively seeks ways to improve her life. She is described as determined, responsible, and focused on moving forward, even when it's difficult. These traits are inconsistent with seeing herself as lazy. She consistently takes action to support her family, manage her health, and pursue her goals, which suggests she would not identify with being lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Lauren has spoken openly about her struggles with anxiety, chronic back pain, and migraines, which have made it harder for her to handle stress. She also mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times and needing to learn new coping strategies like journaling and being more open with her family. While she is making progress, she still describes feeling stuck and stressed at times, which suggests she does not see herself as someone who handles stress well.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Lauren mentions that she enjoys reading and writing, and she is currently taking online writing courses to explore a future in creative writing. This shows she has a clear interest in artistic expression, particularly in writing. She also describes herself as someone who finds strength in small acts of kindness and connection, which aligns with a more creative or expressive personality. Her engagement with writing and her desire to explore it further indicate she does not see herself as having few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Lauren describes herself as a 'quiet kid' who wasn't the most outgoing, and she often reflects on feeling like she's 'going through the motions' or 'just barely keeping up.' She mentions not using social media much and preferring texting or calling friends rather than engaging on platforms like Instagram or Facebook. She also notes that she's been trying to be more open with her family and friends, but there's no indication she sees herself as particularly outgoing or sociable.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Lauren comes across as empathetic, reflective, and focused on her own growth and the well-being of her family.

She also mentions helping her mother with grading and lesson planning, which suggests she is attentive and detail-oriented. While she doesn't describe herself as ambitious or seeking advancement, she consistently shows a strong work ethic and a sense of duty, which aligns with a mid-to-high score on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Lauren has mentioned struggling with anxiety, particularly in the past few years, and has described feeling overwhelmed by the weight of her responsibilities. She has also acknowledged feeling stuck and stressed about her future, which aligns with someone who gets nervous easily. While she has been making efforts to manage her mental health, the interview suggests that she still experiences significant emotional strain, which would make her more likely to identify with the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Lauren mentions her love for reading and writing, and she describes herself as someone who 'loves reading and writing' from a young age. She also engages in freelance writing and is taking online writing courses, which suggests a creative and imaginative mindset. While she may not see herself as highly imaginative due to her practical life circumstances, her engagement with creative activities supports a higher score."

            "BES-A_2": "Lauren describes herself as someone who values connection and has close relationships with her family and a few friends. She is introspective and emotionally aware, often reflecting on her own feelings and those of others. She has a deep understanding of her mother's sacrifices and her sister's experiences, which suggests she is attuned to the emotions of those around her. This emotional awareness makes it unlikely she would struggle to recognize when her friends are frightened.",

She frequently reflects on the feelings and experiences of others, such as her mother, sister, and coworkers.

She is deeply connected to her family and values their support, but she also admits to feeling stuck and uncertain about her future. While she is supportive of her friends and family, she does not describe herself as someone who takes charge or leads others through fear. Instead, she seems more likely to be affected by her own fears and uncertainties, which suggests she might not feel confident in working out others' fears.",
            "BES-A_5": "Lauren describes herself as quiet and introspective, often reflecting on her own emotions and struggles. While she values connection deeply and has strong relationships with her family and friends, she does not explicitly mention being particularly attuned to others' emotions or being able to sense them without being told. Her focus seems more on her own journey, challenges, and internal reflections rather than on reading others' feelings intuitively.",

She is also reflective and aware of her own emotions and those of her loved ones.

While she values connection and has close relationships with her family and a few friends, she doesn't emphasize being particularly attuned to others' emotions. She also reflects on feeling overwhelmed and not always being in tune with her own needs, which may extend to her ability to read others' emotions quickly.",
            "BES-A_8": "Lauren describes having close friends from high school, such as Jamie and Marcus, with whom she maintains regular contact. She mentions that Jamie encouraged her to consider returning to school, and Marcus supported her through shared struggles. This suggests that she is aware of her friends' feelings and values their input, indicating a higher level of emotional awareness and connection.",
            "BES-A_9": "Lauren describes herself as a quiet, introspective person who values connection but doesn't engage heavily with social media or large groups. She mentions having a few close friends and being supported by them, but she doesn't emphasize emotional attunement or social interaction as a key part of her identity. She also doesn't mention having trouble understanding her friends' emotions, which suggests she may be reasonably attuned to them. However, she doesn't explicitly state that she is highly skilled at reading others' emotions either. Given her reflective nature, it's likely she would rate herself somewhere in the middle, but leaning slightly toward the lower end due to her introspective tendencies."

She has acknowledged feeling overwhelmed by financial strain, health challenges, and the weight of unmet expectations. She also mentioned that she feels she missed out on opportunities and sometimes wonders what could have been. These reflections suggest a lack of confidence in her ability to navigate complex or uncertain situations, aligning with a higher score on this scale.",
            "REI_2": "Lauren describes herself as someone who values connection and emotional support, and while she is capable and hardworking, she also reflects on feeling stuck or uncertain about her future. She has not pursued higher education and has not mentioned engaging in tasks that require detailed logical analysis. Her focus has been more on emotional resilience, family support, and small steps forward, which suggests she may not view herself as strong in logical analysis.",
            "REI_3": "Lauren describes herself as someone who values connection, emotional well-being, and small acts of kindness. She reflects on her life with introspection and emotional depth, often focusing on personal growth and relationships. While she does engage in some structured tasks like online writing courses and budgeting, she does not emphasize analytical thinking or problem-solving as a core part of her identity. Her narrative suggests a more intuitive, emotionally driven approach to life.",
            "REI_4": "Lauren demonstrates thoughtful reflection throughout the interview, often weighing options and considering the long-term implications of her decisions. She carefully reflects on her life choices, her family, and her health, showing a clear ability to think through complex situations. This suggests she does have a strong point in reasoning things out carefully, even if she sometimes feels uncertain or stuck.",
            "REI_5": "Lauren has described feeling overwhelmed by life's challenges, including financial strain, health issues, and the weight of unmet expectations. She has also mentioned anxiety and the difficulty of managing multiple responsibilities, which suggests she may struggle with reasoning under pressure. However, she also shows resilience and a steady determination to move forward, which could imply she handles pressure better than she admits. Still, her self-reported struggles with stress and emotional coping suggest she is more likely to agree with the statement.",
            "REI_6": "Lauren describes herself as someone who often feels stuck, makes decisions based on immediate family needs, and reflects on her life with emotional depth rather than analytical precision. She does not emphasize logical reasoning as a strength, and her decisions seem more intuitive or emotionally driven, such as choosing to forgo college to support her family. She also expresses uncertainty about her future and reflects on her choices with a sense of emotional weight rather than logical calculation.",
            "REI_7": "Lauren describes herself as someone who values connection, emotional resilience, and small steps toward growth. She reflects on her life with introspection and emotional awareness, but there is little indication that she identifies as particularly logical or analytical. Her focus on personal relationships, emotional well-being, and creative pursuits (like writing) suggests she may lean more toward intuition and emotional intelligence than structured logic.",
            "REI_8": "Lauren demonstrates a thoughtful and reflective nature throughout the interview. She often pauses to consider her choices, such as when she reflects on her decision to forgo college and take a job to support her family. She also shows a tendency to weigh options carefully, as seen in her discussions about her future, health, and financial decisions. Her introspective style and deliberate approach to life suggest she is someone who values thinking things through carefully.",
            "REI_9": "Lauren describes herself as someone who often feels stuck and reflects on her life with a mix of nostalgia and uncertainty. She emphasizes emotional and relational aspects of her life, such as family support and small acts of kindness, over structured or logical approaches. While she is thoughtful and introspective, her narrative suggests she leans on personal connections and emotional resilience rather than a purely logical framework for problem-solving.",
            "REI_10": "Lauren reflects on her decisions with a sense of awareness and introspection, particularly when discussing her choice to forgo college to support her family. She acknowledges the conscious nature of her decision and weighs the pros and cons, even if it felt like it 'just happened.' She also revisits her choices and considers alternative paths, which suggests she is capable of articulating the reasoning behind her decisions, even if they were difficult."
