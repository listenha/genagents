            "BFI-10_1": "Lauren describes herself as a 'quiet kid' who wasn't the most outgoing and still reflects on how she 'wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life until I got to high school.' She also mentions that she 'wasn't sure what I wanted to study yet' and 'still dreams about going back to school someday.' These statements suggest a tendency to be introspective and cautious, aligning with a more reserved self-perception.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Lauren describes herself as someone who puts others first, supports her family, and has a strong sense of gratitude for the people in her life. She also mentions being close to her mother, sister, and coworkers, and values connection with others. While she has experienced challenges and stress, she shows a tendency to trust and rely on her family and friends, which suggests a moderate to high level of trust in others.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Lauren describes herself as someone who works full-time, helps her mother with her teaching duties, takes online courses, and is actively trying to improve her life. She is conscious of her responsibilities and is making efforts to move forward, even if it’s slow. She does not exhibit behaviors or self-perceptions that align with laziness.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Lauren has spoken openly about her struggles with anxiety and stress, including chronic back pain, migraines, and the emotional weight of balancing family responsibilities with her own goals. She has also mentioned feeling stuck and overwhelmed at times, and while she is making progress in developing coping strategies, she still describes days when she feels like she is going through the motions. This suggests she does not see herself as someone who handles stress well, but she is working on it.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Lauren mentions that she enjoys reading and writing, and she even took online writing courses to pursue her creative side. She also describes herself as someone who 'still feels connected to who I used to be, before I got caught up in all the responsibilities,' which suggests that she has a meaningful artistic interest in writing. This indicates that she would not rate herself as having 'few artistic interests.'",
            "BFI-10_6": "Lauren describes herself as a 'quiet kid' who wasn't the most outgoing. She also mentions that she's not sure what she wants to do with her life and has been focused on work and family responsibilities. While she has a few close friends and coworkers, she doesn't appear to be someone who actively seeks out social interactions or enjoys being the center of attention. Her reflections suggest she is more introspective and cautious in her social interactions.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Lauren describes herself as someone who puts others first, supports her family, and is grateful for the people in her life. She shows empathy and understanding, particularly toward her mother, father, and sister. She does not express any tendencies to find fault with others or to be critical of them. Instead, she reflects on her own struggles and the sacrifices of her family with gratitude and compassion.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Lauren describes her work at the bookstore as steady and reliable, and she takes pride in doing her job well. She mentions that she is a 'reliable part of the team' and that she 'takes pride in doing my job well.' These statements suggest that she sees herself as someone who is careful and committed to her responsibilities, which aligns with a higher score on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Lauren has discussed her struggles with anxiety, particularly in the past few years, and has mentioned feeling overwhelmed by responsibilities and the weight of expectations. She also described having migraines and back pain that made it harder to focus, which could contribute to feelings of nervousness. While she has been working on coping strategies, she still acknowledges the emotional toll of her situation, which aligns more with the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Lauren mentions her love for reading and writing, which are strongly tied to imagination. She also reflects on her childhood as a 'quiet kid' who 'loved reading and writing,' and she has recently started taking online writing courses. These details suggest she engages with imaginative and creative activities, even if she hasn't pursued them fully. Her introspective nature and connection to stories also indicate an active imagination."

She also reflects on the importance of emotional support and understanding in her life, which suggests she is able to empathize with others' emotions and happiness.",
            "BES-A_2": "Lauren describes herself as a quiet, introspective person who has often prioritized others' needs over her own. She has a close relationship with her sister and a few friends, but she doesn't mention being particularly attuned to the emotional states of others. She also doesn't express a strong ability to read people's emotions or react to them. Based on her self-described personality and lack of explicit evidence of high emotional awareness, it's more likely she would score lower on this question.",
            "BES-A_3": "Lauren has shown a clear ability to reflect on her own emotions, struggles, and the emotional states of her family members. She acknowledges her anxiety, her family's sacrifices, and her own emotional growth. She also expresses understanding of her mother's stress and her sister's challenges, showing she can relate to others' feelings. This suggests she has a strong capacity for empathy and emotional understanding.",
            "BES-A_4": "Lauren describes herself as someone who is quiet, introspective, and often puts others first. While she is supportive of her family and friends, she also acknowledges feeling stuck in her own life and struggling with anxiety and self-doubt. She doesn't explicitly mention being the one to comfort others during fear, but she does show care and support for her family and friends. However, she also seems to be more focused on her own struggles and growth, which may suggest she is less likely to see herself as someone who can reliably comfort others in fear.",
            "BES-A_5": "Lauren describes herself as a quiet, introspective person who often reflects on her own emotions and the emotions of her family. She is deeply connected to her mother and sister, and she is aware of their struggles and emotions. However, she does not explicitly mention being able to sense others' feelings before they are expressed. Her introspection and emotional awareness suggest she may have some empathy, but she is not described as highly perceptive of others’ emotions in real-time.",
            "BES-A_6": "Lauren describes herself as a quiet, introspective person who often feels like she is 'going through the motions' and has struggled with anxiety and stress. She also mentions feeling overwhelmed by her responsibilities and not always being in a place where she feels energized. This suggests she may not be someone who is naturally energized by others' cheerfulness, especially in the context of physical activity.",
            "BES-A_7": "Lauren describes herself as a quiet, introspective person who has often prioritized others' needs over her own. While she has close friends and is emotionally aware in her own life, she does not emphasize being particularly attuned to others' emotions in the interview. She reflects more on her own feelings and struggles than on her ability to interpret others’ emotions quickly.",
            "BES-A_8": "Lauren describes having close friends from high school, such as Jamie and Marcus, with whom she maintains regular contact. She mentions that Jamie encouraged her to consider returning to school and that Marcus has been a support system. This suggests that she is aware of her friends' feelings and values their input. She also reflects on the importance of her relationships and the support she receives from others, indicating a level of emotional awareness and connection.",
            "BES-A_9": "Lauren describes herself as a quiet, introspective person who has not always been open about her struggles or emotions. While she has close friends and values relationships, she has not explicitly mentioned being highly attuned to others' emotions. Her focus has been more on her own challenges, family, and work, which suggests she may not be as in tune with her friends' emotional states as someone who is more socially engaged or empathetic."

While she has taken steps like enrolling in online courses and setting goals, she also mentions feeling overwhelmed by her health, financial situation, and the weight of responsibility. This suggests a degree of self-perceived limitation in handling complex problems, especially when life feels heavy and uncertain.",
            "REI_2": "Lauren mentions she has struggled with anxiety and stress, and while she has been working on coping strategies like journaling and setting small goals, there is no indication that she has strong confidence in her ability to solve complex logical problems. She has focused more on emotional and practical challenges rather than analytical or logical ones. Her narrative suggests she may not see herself as someone who excels in logical analysis.",
            "REI_3": "Lauren describes herself as someone who values connection, emotional support, and small, personal moments over structured or logical processes. She reflects on her life with a focus on emotional and relational experiences, and she often emphasizes feeling, intuition, and the support of others rather than breaking down problems into logical components. She does not mention any strong preference for analytical thinking or problem-solving in her work or personal life.",
            "REI_4": "Lauren demonstrates thoughtful reflection throughout the interview, often weighing her options and considering the long-term implications of her decisions. She reflects on her past choices, her current life situation, and her future goals with a great deal of care and consideration. This suggests that she does value and engage in careful reasoning, even if she sometimes feels uncertain or stuck.",
            "REI_5": "Lauren has described experiencing anxiety and stress, particularly related to her health, financial situation, and life decisions. She has mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times and struggling with chronic issues like migraines and back pain, which can impair her ability to think clearly. While she is resilient and determined, her interview suggests that pressure—whether from work, health, or life circumstances—does affect her, aligning more with a higher score on this scale.",
            "REI_6": "Lauren describes herself as someone who often feels stuck, reflects deeply on her decisions, and tends to be introspective and emotional in her thinking. She mentions feeling overwhelmed by life's pressures and has not pursued formal education or career paths that require strong logical reasoning. Her decision-making process seems more intuitive and emotionally driven, as seen in her reflections on family, health, and life choices.",
            "REI_7": "Lauren describes herself as someone who is reflective, values personal connections, and has often made decisions based on emotional and familial considerations rather than strict logic. She also mentions moments of uncertainty and introspection, which suggest she may lean more toward intuition and emotional reasoning than strict logic. While she is thoughtful and organized in her daily routines, there is no explicit mention of her relying on logic as a defining trait.",
            "REI_8": "Lauren demonstrates a tendency to think carefully about her decisions, as seen in her reflection on her choice to work full-time after high school rather than attend college. She often weighs options, considers the impact on her family, and reflects on her life choices in detail. This suggests she values careful thought and deliberation.",
            "REI_9": "Lauren describes herself as someone who often feels stuck in life, struggles with anxiety, and has made decisions based on emotional and familial responsibilities rather than logical analysis. She reflects on her life with a sense of uncertainty and has not pursued structured paths like college or career advancement. Her decision-making seems more intuitive and influenced by emotional factors, such as putting her family first at 19. This suggests she may not rely heavily on logic to solve problems in her life.",
            "REI_10": "Lauren reflects on her decisions with a great deal of thought and consideration, especially when it comes to major life choices, such as whether to go to college or stay with her family. She often weighs the pros and cons of her options and acknowledges the reasoning behind her decisions, even when they were difficult. However, she also expresses uncertainty and hesitation, which may suggest that she doesn't always feel fully confident in her reasoning. Still, her introspective nature and ability to articulate the reasons behind her choices lean her toward a higher score."

While she has close relationships with her mother and a few friends, she has not mentioned having a romantic partner or engaging in many social interactions beyond her immediate family and coworkers. She also expressed a tendency to carry emotional burdens and put others first, which may suggest a cautious or guarded approach to trust. However, she has also shown vulnerability and openness in the interview, especially when discussing her mental health and family dynamics, which could indicate a more trusting nature.",

Instead, she appears to be someone who is working hard and striving to move forward, even if progress is slow.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Lauren has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, migraines, and chronic back pain, which have made it harder for her to manage stress. She also mentioned that she used to push through everything without asking for help, which suggests she hasn't always handled stress well. However, she has started to develop better coping strategies, like journaling and being more open with her family. While she is making progress, her overall narrative suggests she still finds stress management challenging.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Lauren mentions that she enjoys reading and writing, and she even took online writing courses to explore her creative side. She also describes herself as someone who 'keeps her creative side alive' through freelance writing. This suggests she has at least some artistic interest, though it may not be a central part of her identity.",

However, she doesn't show a high level of emotional insight into others' feelings, which would be needed for a score of 5. A score of 3 seems more likely, as she is socially engaged but doesn't demonstrate deep emotional awareness of others' moods."

This suggests she has a meaningful artistic interest in writing, which would place her closer to the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Lauren describes herself as a 'quiet kid' who wasn't the most outgoing, and she often reflects on how she missed out on opportunities due to focusing on family responsibilities. She also mentions that she prefers texting and calling over using social media, and she values small, meaningful connections over large social interactions. While she has close friends and coworkers, she doesn't seem to seek out or enjoy being the center of attention or large social gatherings.",

She also reflects on her past dreams and what could have been, indicating a level of imaginative thinking.
