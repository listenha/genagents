Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nJames Wagner: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. My parents, both of German descent, were high school graduates, but they worked hard to provide for our family. Growing up, we lived in a typical suburban neighborhood, and I attended public schools. My mother worked part-time at a local bookstore, while my father managed a small hardware store. They instilled in me the values of hard work and responsibility, which have stayed with me throughout my life.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nJames Wagner: One such moment came when I was around 18 years old. I had just graduated from high school and was faced with choosing between going to a community college nearby or moving away to attend a four-year university. On one hand, staying close to home would allow me to save money and be closer to my family. On the other hand, attending a larger university promised new opportunities and a more diverse experience. After much contemplation, I decided to take the leap and move to a different city for college. It was a tough decision, but I felt it was important to challenge myself and broaden my horizons. Since then, I've been working hard to build a successful career and make the most of the experiences that have come my way.\n\n",

In the end, I felt that taking the risk of moving away would give me more independence and a better chance to explore different perspectives. It's been challenging at times, but I'm glad I made that decision.\n\n",

Additionally, I've started journaling more, which allows me to express my feelings and reflect on my experiences. It's been a process, but I feel like I'm making progress in managing my emotions better.\n\n",

Rent is a fixed cost, and I pay $1,200 a month for a one-bedroom apartment in Oakwood. Groceries are essential, and I try to budget about $300 a month for food, which includes both meals out and cooking at home. Transportation costs around $100 a month, mainly for parking and occasional rideshare trips when I need to run errands. Beyond that, I allocate some money for entertainment and hobbies, like joining the book club and attending fitness classes, which help me stay engaged and maintain my health.\n\n",

Apart from that, my water and internet bills have been steady. I've tried to be mindful of conserving water and limiting my streaming services to save a little extra.
