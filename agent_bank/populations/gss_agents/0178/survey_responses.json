            "BFI-10_1": "Marcus Cortez describes himself as someone who is not the most social, prefers face-to-face interactions over digital ones, and values personal connections. He mentions being content with his current life and not feeling the need to be the life of the party. He also reflects on how he's learned to be more present and grounded, which aligns with being reserved rather than outgoing.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Marcus Cortez has shown a strong sense of gratitude and appreciation for the people who have supported him throughout his life, including his parents, mentors, and friends. He has spoken positively about the trust and support he has received from others, which suggests a general tendency to trust people. While he has not explicitly mentioned his level of trust in others, his narrative reflects a belief in the value of relationships and the importance of people who believe in him, which aligns with a higher level of trust.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Marcus Cortez has demonstrated a strong work ethic throughout his life, from working part-time during college to making conscious decisions to pursue education over immediate financial gain. He consistently reflects on his efforts to stay active, manage his health, and maintain a structured routine. He also takes initiative in learning new skills, like photography, and is focused on long-term goals. These traits suggest he does not see himself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Marcus Cortez has reflected on his stress levels and emotional coping strategies throughout the interview. He has acknowledged that he used to carry a lot of pressure and felt overwhelmed by expectations, but he has since learned to prioritize self-care, accept that it's okay to have off days, and find emotional outlets like photography and journaling. While he still has moments of stress, he has made significant progress in managing it and has developed healthier coping strategies. This suggests he is more aligned with a middle to higher end of the scale, but not a perfect 5.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant mentioned taking up photography as a hobby and even posting some of his photos online. This indicates an interest in artistic expression, even if it's not a primary focus. He also described how photography helps him slow down and appreciate the world around him, which suggests a meaningful connection to an artistic activity. While he doesn't frame himself as someone with many artistic interests, the fact that he actively engages in photography and finds joy in it makes it unlikely he would rate himself as having 'few' artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Marcus Cortez describes himself as not the most social person, preferring more personal, face-to-face interactions over digital ones. He mentions having a few close friends and mentors but does not emphasize a desire for large social circles or frequent socializing.

Instead, he focuses on his own journey and the positive influences in his life.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Throughout the interview, Marcus consistently demonstrates a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and a commitment to doing things right. He reflects on his career choices, his approach to work, and even his personal routines with a sense of responsibility and intentionality. He emphasizes the importance of making smart choices, being consistent, and taking care of his health and finances. These traits align with someone who values thoroughness in their work.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Throughout the interview, Marcus Cortez demonstrates a sense of self-awareness, responsibility, and emotional control. He reflects on his past struggles with self-doubt and pressure but also emphasizes his ability to manage stress through routines, photography, and journaling. He doesn’t describe himself as someone who gets nervous easily, and instead portrays himself as someone who has learned to cope with life’s challenges and maintain a sense of balance.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Marcus Cortez mentions taking up photography as a hobby, which suggests a creative and imaginative side. He also reflects on capturing moments and finding joy in the small things, which aligns with an active imagination. However, he also describes himself as someone who values structure, stability, and responsibility, which might suggest a more practical side. Still, his engagement with photography and his reflective nature indicate a level of imagination that leans toward the higher end of the scale."
