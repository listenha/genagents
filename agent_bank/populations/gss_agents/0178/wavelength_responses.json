Some are genuinely terrifying, while others are more suspenseful or atmospheric. I’ve seen horror movies that left me on edge and others that felt more like a slow, uneventful experience. Given that horror movies are generally intended to be frightening, I would place this clue closer to the 'scared to death' end of the spectrum, but not at the extreme. There’s a balance between fear and boredom, and I think most horror movies fall somewhere in the middle, leaning more toward being scary than boring."

While basic arithmetic is straightforward, the deeper you go into math—like understanding patterns, solving equations, or applying it to real-world problems—it becomes more intricate. My experience with math in school and in my work as a business analyst has shown me that it's a subject that can be both practical and deeply complex, depending on the context.

I believe the clue 'cat' falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, as cats can be both friendly and standoffish depending on their personality and environment.

My own experiences with photography have shown me that what one person finds beautiful may not resonate with another.

From my perspective, the noise from an aircraft engine is unmistakably loud and can be heard from a distance.
