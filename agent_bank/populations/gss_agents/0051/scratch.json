  "agent_profile_summary": "Devon Johnson, a 42-year-old public policy research analyst in Chicago, grew up in East Chicago, Indiana, the son of Jamaican immigrants who worked multiple jobs to support their family. After earning a graduate degree, he joined the military for over four years, a decision shaped by both personal ambition and economic necessity, which later provided him with discipline and a sense of purpose that carried into his career. Now living in Lincoln Park, he balances part-time work with community involvement, including volunteering at a local food bank and advocating for social justice through his research. His life is guided by a commitment to making a tangible difference, though he navigates the tension between his desire for financial stability and his passion for public service. Devon’s relationships—whether with his supportive family, close friends, or colleagues—are marked by a collaborative spirit and a shared belief in positive change."
