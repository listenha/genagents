            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Devon describes himself as someone who values community and spends time with family and friends, indicating a desire for connection. However, he also mentions that he's been working on being more intentional about his coping strategies and that social media has been a tool for him to seek emotional support. This suggests a balance between social engagement and personal space, leaning slightly towards being more sociable rather than reserved.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Devon appears to be someone who values community and support, suggesting a generally trusting nature. He talks about the importance of community and the support from his family and friends, indicating that he is likely to trust others and feel comfortable with people around him. While he does mention some challenges and stress, these don't suggest a pervasive lack of trust. Therefore, it is more likely that he leans towards trusting people and situations.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on the interview, Devon appears to be someone who values hard work and has a strong commitment to his career and community. He describes himself as someone who manages a busy schedule and engages in various activities like work, volunteering, and community events.

            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Devon has mentioned experiencing stress and feeling overwhelmed at times, particularly during the pandemic and with work pressures. However, he has also talked about coping mechanisms such as reading, practicing mindfulness, and journaling, indicating that he tries to manage his stress. While he has acknowledged that it can be tough to stay relaxed, his efforts to cope suggest he is working on handling stress well. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that he would lean towards a moderate score rather than a low or high score.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Devon describes himself as someone who engages in community work and has meaningful connections with friends and family, but he does not mention any specific artistic interests. He also mentions that he reads and watches documentaries, which could be seen as a form of engagement with culture, but it's not explicitly described as artistic. Given his focus on work and community engagement, it suggests he may not prioritize or identify with artistic interests strongly.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Devon describes himself as someone who is engaged in community work, volunteers at a local food bank, and has a wide range of social connections, including friends, family, and colleagues.

He mentions being supportive of his family and colleagues, and focuses on making a positive impact on society.

He also mentions that the most rewarding part of his job is seeing how their work can make a tangible difference in people's lives, indicating a level of dedication and attention to detail.

            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Devon has experienced stress and anxiety, particularly with the challenges of balancing work and personal life, managing the pandemic, and dealing with lower back pain. However, he also mentioned coping strategies such as mindfulness, journaling, and seeking support from his community. This suggests he is not entirely free from nervousness but also not extremely prone to it. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems most fitting.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Devon seems to have a pragmatic and realistic approach to life. He focuses on practical solutions and community impact, and his professional and personal life revolves around concrete actions and responsibilities.

            "BES-A_2": "Based on Devon's responses, he describes himself as someone who tries to be intentional about his coping strategies and who values the support of his community. This suggests that he is likely to be somewhat attuned to the emotions of others, even if it's not effortless. He has mentioned using social media to seek emotional support and connecting with others who share similar struggles, indicating some level of emotional awareness.

He has also mentioned trying to be more intentional about his coping strategies and seeking support during tough times. This suggests that Devon can understand and relate to others' feelings of being down, although he might sometimes find it challenging. Given his recognition of the weight of these issues, a score of 3 or 4 would seem most fitting, but leaning towards a slightly lower score as he acknowledges the complexity of fully understanding someone's emotions.",

            "BES-A_8": "Based on the interview, Devon appears to be a reflective individual who values community and support. However, he also mentions that he uses social media to seek emotional support during tough times, indicating he might not always be acutely aware of his friends' feelings in real life.

He has shown resilience and a willingness to work through difficult situations, indicating he is likely not someone who feels incapable of handling complicated problems. Therefore, it's more probable that he would choose a higher number on this scale.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Devon seems to have a balanced outlook on his abilities and challenges. He has faced various challenges, including work stress, back pain, and financial constraints, but he also mentions using coping strategies and finding fulfillment in his work. Given his reflection on the importance of resilience and problem-solving in his life, it is reasonable to assume he does not view himself as completely unable to handle logical analysis problems. However, he also does not claim to be exceptionally good at them. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems most appropriate.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Devon is more focused on community engagement, social justice, and practical solutions rather than deep analytical thinking. He mentions that he finds his work meaningful through community impact, and his coping strategies involve more emotional and social support rather than analytical methods. This suggests he is more aligned with the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_4": "Based on the interview, Devon Johnson seems to have a more spontaneous and flexible approach to problem-solving. He mentions that he has been working on being more intentional about his coping strategies but also notes that it's not always easy and he has to be proactive about taking care of himself. This suggests that while he values thoughtful processes, he doesn't necessarily excel at reasoning things out carefully. His description of relying on mindfulness and other coping mechanisms indicates a tendency to react rather than overthink situations.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Devon has faced various challenges, including balancing work, personal life, and community engagement. He has described feeling stressed and struggling with the weight of responsibilities, but he has also mentioned using coping mechanisms like mindfulness and journaling.

            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Devon describes himself as someone who has pursued higher education and is working in a research-based role at a nonprofit organization. These experiences suggest he values logical thinking and problem-solving. Additionally, he mentions that he is trying to be more intentional about his coping strategies and has found reading and mindfulness helpful, indicating a level of self-awareness and possibly analytical skills. However, he also describes his current part-time job as challenging and notes that he is constantly looking for ways to improve his financial stability and professional standing, which might reflect a more balanced view of his abilities.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Devon is described as someone who has pursued a career in public policy and engages in community work. These activities require a certain level of logical thinking and analysis. Additionally, he mentions that he tries to be more intentional about his coping strategies and manages his time effectively, indicating some level of logical thinking. However, his description does not suggest he is extremely analytical or logical in every aspect of his life. Therefore, a score of 3 seems most appropriate, but since the range only goes from 1 to 5, a 4 might be a bit high, and a 3 is a safer midpoint.",
            "REI_8": "Based on Devon's interview, he appears to be someone who values thoughtful analysis and strategic thinking. He mentions working as a research analyst and engaging in community work, which suggests he is detail-oriented and likes to consider the implications of his actions.

His work involves conducting thorough research, analyzing data, and supporting policy initiatives, which suggests he is accustomed to using logic to solve problems.

He reflects on how he made significant choices, like joining the military, with a mix of practical considerations and personal reflection.

He has described moments of feeling overwhelmed and has been working on coping strategies. While he acknowledges that stress is a part of his life, he has also talked about trying to manage it and finding ways to stay centered. This suggests that while he struggles with stress, he is not entirely unable to handle it. Therefore, a score closer to 3 or 4 might be more fitting, but considering the slightly lower end of that range, 3 would be a more accurate representation.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Devon describes himself as someone who engages in community work and social justice efforts, suggesting he values and is involved in activities that can be seen as forms of expression or advocacy. Additionally, he mentions volunteering at a food bank and participating in community outreach, which can be creative endeavors. While he doesn't explicitly mention artistic hobbies, his active involvement in community and social issues indicates he values different forms of expression. Therefore, it's unlikely he would strongly agree that he has few artistic interests.",

He mentions spending time with family, friends, and participating in community events, which suggests he enjoys social interactions.

He mentions that there are moments when the weight of everything can feel overwhelming. This suggests that he likely experiences nervousness or anxiety at times. However, he also mentions that he has coping mechanisms in place, such as reading and practicing mindfulness, which indicates that he is not always in a state of constant nervousness.

His career suggests he is skilled in these areas. Additionally, he mentions engaging in community work and advocacy, which also require thoughtful and analytical approaches. Therefore, it's unlikely that he would strongly agree with the statement that he is not very good at solving problems requiring careful logical analysis.",

This suggests that while he may not always reason things out carefully, he is aware of the importance of thoughtful decision-making and is working to improve in that area. Therefore, it is likely that he would choose a middle ground, acknowledging that he is not always a careful reasoner but also recognizing the value of careful thought.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Devon has faced various challenges, including work pressures and the ongoing pandemic. However, he mentions trying to be more intentional about his coping strategies and finding ways to stay calm and process his thoughts. While he does acknowledge that certain periods can be particularly stressful, he has developed some methods to manage his stress, such as reading and practicing mindfulness.

            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Devon appears to be a thoughtful and reflective individual, but he also mentions that he has been working on coping strategies and managing stress. This suggests he is aware of his strengths and weaknesses. While he does not explicitly mention being exceptionally good at logical reasoning, he does engage in analytical work as a research analyst.

He is also involved in community work and advocacy, which often require logical and systematic thinking.

He has spoken about the importance of being intentional about his coping strategies, such as reading and practicing mindfulness, and has expressed a desire to be more proactive about his health.

            "REI_9": "Based on the interview, Devon is a thoughtful and analytical individual who has pursued a career in public policy and research analysis. These roles require a strong ability to analyze data and think logically. Additionally, his involvement in community work and advocacy suggests he often uses logical reasoning to address issues. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that he would rate his ability to use logic in solving problems as high.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Devon appears to have a thoughtful and reflective approach to his life and decisions. He often reflects on the factors that led him to certain choices, such as joining the military or pursuing a career in public policy.
