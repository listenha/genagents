Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nElizabeth Smith: Well, I was born in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, but I moved to the United States when I was just a baby. My family settled in Charleston, South Carolina, and I grew up there. My childhood wasn't easy\u2014my family wasn't well off, and I remember having to work part-time jobs from a young age to help out. My mother was a teacher, and she always encouraged me to value education, even though my father only had a high school diploma. I left home before I turned 16 to attend a boarding school in the state, which was a big change for me. I missed my family a lot, but I knew it was an opportunity to get a better future. I earned a bachelor's degree in business administration, and I've been working full-time ever since. I married my husband, James, a few years ago, and we're trying to build a stable life together. I'm proud of where I've come from, and I still speak Portuguese at home with my parents when they visit. Life hasn't been without its challenges, but I've always tried to stay positive and focused on the future.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nElizabeth Smith: Yes, there was definitely a crossroads. After I graduated from high school, I had two main options: stay in Charleston and work at the local store where my mother's sister worked, or take a scholarship to a boarding school in North Carolina. The scholarship was a huge opportunity, but leaving my family was terrifying. I remember sitting at the kitchen table with my parents, my mother crying and my father just nodding silently. I chose the boarding school, and that decision changed everything. It was hard\u2014adjusting to a new environment, making friends, and dealing with homesickness. But I met teachers who believed in me, and I started to see myself as someone who could achieve more than I ever thought possible. That experience taught me resilience and the value of education. It also shaped my perspective on life\u2014now I believe that sometimes the hardest choices are the ones that lead to the most growth.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nElizabeth Smith: I think, in that moment, it was a conscious choice, but one that felt almost inevitable. I knew staying in Charleston would mean a life of routine, working at the store, maybe never leaving the city. I wanted more for myself, even if I didn't know exactly what that more looked like. I remember telling my mother that I didn't want to be stuck in the same place my father was\u2014working a job that didn't challenge me, not really growing. I think I was afraid of regret more than anything else. And so, I made the choice to take the scholarship, even though it scared me to death. Looking back, I don't think I could have made a different decision and still been the same person I am today.\n\n",

My mother was the one who really pushed me to consider the scholarship. She had always believed in education, even though she wasn't able to pursue it herself. She worked multiple jobs to support my father and me, and she never complained. When I was struggling with the decision, she sat me down and said, 'If you don't take this chance, you'll always wonder what could have been.' That stayed with me. I also remember the principal from the boarding school reaching out to my mother after I applied, telling her that I had potential and that the school wanted to give me a shot. I think it was a combination of people\u2014my mother's belief in me, the school's willingness to take a chance on a student from a different background, and my own fear of regret\u2014that helped me take that step. Without them, I don't know if I would have had the courage to leave everything I knew behind.\n\n",

She's now a social worker in Charleston, and she's always been there for me\u2014whether it was during my studies or when I was figuring out my career path. She's one of the few people who really understood what it was like to come from a different background and still want to make something of yourself. Then there's Marcus, who I met later in my career. He works in marketing, and we've been friends for almost a decade. He's the kind of person who always knows how to make me laugh, even on my worst days.

I've also felt a deeper sense of gratitude for the people in my life\u2014James, my friends, and even my parents, who continue to support me from afar. I've been working on setting clearer boundaries between work and personal time, which has helped me feel more balanced. There were moments when I felt uncertain about the future, especially with the plans for our family, but I've learned to trust the process. I think, more than anything, I've felt a sense of purpose in what I do\u2014knowing that my work helps others, even in small ways, gives me a sense of meaning that I didn't always have before. It's not perfect, but I feel like I'm exactly where I need to be, growing and learning every day.\n\n",

How about for you?\n\nElizabeth Smith: I think I've struggled with anxiety at different points in my life, especially during times of major change or uncertainty. When I was deciding to leave home for the boarding school, or when I was starting my career, I felt that constant pressure to prove myself, to not let my family down, and to make the most of the opportunities I had. There were days when I felt like I was carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders. Over time, I've learned to recognize the signs\u2014when my thoughts start racing, when I can't sleep, or when I feel like I'm stuck in a loop of worry. I've started talking to a therapist a few months ago, which has been really helpful. It's not that I'm completely free of anxiety now, but I feel more equipped to handle it. I've also found that mindfulness practices, like deep breathing or meditation, help me stay centered. I think the key for me has been accepting that anxiety is a part of life, but it doesn't have to control it. I'm still learning, but I'm grateful for the tools I now have to manage it and live a more peaceful life.\n\n",

They've always been proud of me, but I can tell they worry about the distance and the challenges I face here. My mother, in particular, has been very open about her concerns, especially when I was dealing with the back pain and the stress of work. She calls me almost every week, and even though we speak in Portuguese most of the time, she always ends the call with a reminder to take care of myself. My father is more reserved, but I know he's proud of the life I've built and the opportunities I've had. As for my sister, Ana, she's been my biggest cheerleader. She's always encouraging me to keep going, to keep pushing forward, and she's even started helping me with some of my Portuguese lessons for when we visit. I think the distance has made us closer in some ways, even though it's not the same as being together. They've always believed in me, and that's something I carry with me every day.\n\n",

I was raised Protestant, just like my parents, and I still find comfort in the rituals and teachings of the faith. I don't go to church regularly, but I do believe in the importance of community, kindness, and living with integrity\u2014values that are deeply rooted in my religion. My mother, in particular, has always emphasized the importance of faith as a source of strength, especially during difficult times. I think it's helped me through moments of doubt or fear, like when I was leaving home for the boarding school or when I was struggling with anxiety. I don't see religion as something that needs to be loud or outwardly expressed, but rather as a quiet foundation that guides me. It's not the center of my life, but it's something I'm grateful for, and I hope to pass those values on to my future children if we have any.\n\n",

I have a Facebook account where I share updates about my life, especially photos of our garden or our weekend walks with James. I also use it to stay connected with my parents and sister, especially since we don't see each other often.

For me, it's more about staying connected with the people I care about rather than seeking support online. That said, I have found comfort in sharing certain moments with my close friends\u2014like when I was dealing with the back pain or feeling overwhelmed with work. Sometimes, just posting a photo of my garden or a walk with James and getting a message from Sarah or Marcus saying, 'You're doing great,' has been enough to lift my spirits.

We live in a two-story home that's not too big, but it's in a good neighborhood, and the rent is still pretty steep for Charleston. Then there's the cost of groceries, especially since I try to eat healthy and support local farmers when I can. I also have a car payment, insurance, and some savings set aside for emergencies.

In the winter months, our utility bills\u2014particularly heating\u2014go up significantly. We've had to be more mindful of turning down the thermostat and using space heaters strategically to keep costs down. Then, during the summer, our electricity bill spikes because of air conditioning, and we've started using fans more and closing windows during the day to keep the house cooler. Holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving bring a few extra expenses, like decorations, meals, and sometimes gifts for my parents back in Brazil. We also noticed a slight increase in our grocery bills during the school year when we started buying more snacks and ingredients for weekend meals. On the flip side, during the summer, we tend to spend more on dining out or going to local events, which can add up.

I earn a salary as a marketing coordinator, and James has a steady income from his work in IT. We both contribute to the household, which helps us manage our expenses more effectively. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our rent, utilities, groceries, and other necessities while still allowing us to save a little each month. I think the most important thing is that we're both working toward the same goals\u2014building a stable life, planning for the future, and making sure we can provide for each other and, eventually, for any children we may have. It's not always easy, but I feel grateful for the work we both do and the life we're creating together.\n\n",

The nonprofit I work for is small, which means I get to wear a lot of different hats\u2014sometimes I'm managing social media, other times I'm organizing events or working directly with community leaders. The benefits of the job are pretty standard: health insurance, dental and vision coverage, and a decent amount of paid time off. We get about two weeks of vacation each year, plus sick days and personal days. I also appreciate the flexibility they offer, especially with the option to work from home a few days a week. It's not the kind of job that pays a lot, but it's meaningful, and I feel like I'm making a real difference in the lives of others. The team is supportive, and I've learned a lot from my colleagues.

She's always open to feedback and willing to help me grow in my role, whether it's through new projects or professional development opportunities. As for my coworkers, we get along really well. We're a small team, so we're all pretty close, and we often collaborate on different initiatives. There's a real sense of camaraderie here\u2014everyone is passionate about what we do, and that makes the work environment feel more like a community than just a job. I think the fact that we're all working toward a common goal, helping kids in underserved communities, really strengthens our relationships. It's not always easy, especially with limited resources and tight deadlines, but I feel lucky to be part of a team that's dedicated, kind, and always willing to lend a hand when needed.\n\n",

The organization is pretty understanding about the need for flexibility, especially when we're launching new initiatives or preparing for events.

It's a balance\u2014sometimes it feels like we're just scraping by, especially with the rising cost of living in Charleston, but other times, I look at what we've built together and feel proud. James and I both work hard, and we've learned to be intentional with our money, which gives me a sense of control. I know that financial security isn't just about having a lot\u2014it's about knowing that we can handle unexpected things, like a medical bill or a car repair, without falling into debt. I also feel good about the fact that we're saving for the future, whether it's for a home, a family, or just to have some peace of mind. There are days when I worry about what the future holds, especially with the uncertainty of the economy, but I try to focus on what we can control.

She worked full-time at a local school, and sometimes she took on extra jobs, like tutoring or grading papers for other teachers, just to help support the family.

She believed that education was more than just textbooks and tests\u2014it was about helping kids find their voice and believe in themselves. My father worked for a small construction company that specialized in residential projects.
