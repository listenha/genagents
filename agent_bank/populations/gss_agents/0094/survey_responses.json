Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that he would choose a higher number on this scale.",
            "BES-A_5": "Based on the interview, Andrew Johnson seems to be a person who values community and support, and he mentions the importance of having a strong network of people who care about him. This suggests that he has good interpersonal skills and likely possesses a certain level of emotional intelligence. However, the interview does not explicitly mention any extraordinary empathetic abilities that would push him towards the highest end of the scale. Therefore, it's reasonable to infer that he falls somewhere in the middle to upper-middle range of the scale.",
            "BES-A_6": "Based on Andrew's reflections, he seems to value his relationships and community support, indicating that he pays attention to people's emotions. However, there is no specific mention of him being exceptionally skilled at reading people's emotions.

This suggests he has a good grasp of logical reasoning and problem-solving skills, which are crucial in his profession. However, he also mentions that he tries to manage stress by implementing new coping strategies, indicating that he might not feel completely confident in his abilities all the time. Given his background and the fact that he is actively working to improve his stress management, a score of 3 seems most appropriate, but since the scale only goes down to 1, we can reasonably predict he would lean towards the lower end of the spectrum.",

This indicates that he is capable of using logic and analytical skills to navigate problems. However, he also mentioned that the new project at work has been a bit challenging and has required him to adapt his coping strategies. This suggests he may not always find logic as straightforward as someone who is highly analytical. Therefore, a score of 4 seems appropriate, indicating a balanced but slightly lower confidence in his logical problem-solving abilities compared to a highly analytical person.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Andrew seems to value clear and thoughtful decision-making.

This indicates that while he tries to handle stress well, he doesn't necessarily see himself as someone who remains completely relaxed and composed under pressure.

He mentions using strategies like meditation to manage stress and notes that he doesn't struggle with anxiety or depression.
