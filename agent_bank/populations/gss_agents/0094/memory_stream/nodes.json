    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAndrew Johnson: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. My parents were both Native American, though they didn't have much formal education. They worked hard to provide for our family, and my mother had a job at a local factory. Growing up, we lived in the same neighborhood, which was a mix of working-class families. My father was always around, but he didn't go beyond high school and never pursued higher education. He worked odd jobs to support us, while my mother was the primary breadwinner. Despite their limitations, they instilled in me the importance of education and hard work. I remember my mother always saying, 'If you want something, you gotta do something.' So, I made sure to stay focused and do well in school.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAndrew Johnson: One such moment came during my senior year of high school. I was faced with choosing between going to a community college or a four-year university. My parents were supportive but worried about the costs, especially since my mother was nearing retirement age. I had always been academically inclined, but the thought of potentially taking out student loans and the financial burden it might place on my family kept me up at night. After much deliberation, I decided to attend a community college for two years before transferring to a four-year university. I figured this would give me a chance to explore different fields and figure out what I really wanted to do without immediately accruing too much debt. It wasn't an easy decision, but it felt right at the time.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nAndrew Johnson: It was definitely a conscious choice, but one that was influenced by many factors. I knew that attending a community college first would allow me to get a foot in the door at a university without the immediate pressure of high tuition costs. Plus, it gave me the flexibility to explore different subjects and figure out what I truly enjoyed. Looking back, it was a pivotal moment because it not only shaped my educational path but also taught me the value of making strategic decisions.\n\n",

Rent takes up the largest portion, followed by food and gas for my car. I try to save some money each month, but the demands of work and occasional unexpected expenses can make it challenging. I've been thinking about opening a savings account specifically for emergencies to help with that.\n\n",

Rent for the apartment is around $900, groceries cost about $300, and gas for my car is about $150. My sister and I split the cost of her car, so that's another $75. We also spent around $200 on utilities and internet, and another $150 on miscellaneous items like toiletries and small household repairs. I try to save a little bit each month, but it's not always easy. I've been looking into ways to cut costs and maybe find a roommate to help with rent, but we'll see how that goes.\n\n",

In the winter months, our heating bill was higher, costing around $250 a month. During summer, we didn't need to use the air conditioning as much, so that bill was closer to $150. We also had a few unexpected repair costs for the apartment, which added about $200 to our budget in March. Overall, our bills have been fairly stable, but it's always a challenge to predict exactly how much they'll be from month to month.\n\n",
