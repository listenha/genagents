  "agent_profile_summary": "Andrew Johnson, 28, grew up in Philadelphia in a working-class Native American family, where his mother’s steady factory job and his father’s construction work instilled in him the value of hard work and education. After high school, he chose to attend community college before transferring to a four-year university, a strategic move to avoid debt while exploring his academic interests. Now a software engineer at a tech startup, he balances a demanding work schedule with regular family visits and community involvement, particularly helping his sister with her children. He values the support of his close-knit family and neighborhood, which anchors him amid the pressures of his career. Though he strives for greater financial stability and work-life balance, he remains committed to personal growth, continuous learning, and nurturing the relationships that define his life."
