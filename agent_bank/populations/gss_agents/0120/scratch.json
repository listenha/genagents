  "agent_profile_summary": "Ashley Mitchell, a 24-year-old Catholic woman from Chicago, grew up in the East North Central region with a father who was a professor and a mother who worked part-time in administrative support. After earning her bachelor’s degree, she chose to work for a nonprofit focused on youth education over a more lucrative corporate job, a decision that reflected her deep commitment to community service and values. Now living in a diverse neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago, she balances her role as a Program Coordinator at Community Roots with personal routines like meditation, journaling, and caring for her grandmother. Her life is shaped by a tension between financial stability and purpose, yet she remains grounded in her faith, family, and the meaningful work she does to support her community, often prioritizing impact over income."
