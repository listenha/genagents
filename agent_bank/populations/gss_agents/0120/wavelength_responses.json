I've found that many horror movies are engaging and can be thrilling, but they rarely leave me 'scared to death.' However, they also aren't usually so unoriginal or slow-paced that they make me 'bored to death.'

My experiences with challenges in life, such as my back pain or work-related stress, often felt like they were the result of a combination of factors, not pure randomness. Still, the law’s emphasis on the inevitability of things going wrong in ways that seem arbitrary leans more toward randomness.

This requires a proactive and assertive mindset, as the goal is to drive innovation and achieve substantial returns. While there may be passive elements in holding the investment, the nature of venture capital is inherently aggressive due to the level of risk and the active role investors often play in guiding the companies they fund."

While it hints at being in a new city, the mention of candlelight suggests a longing for warmth, familiarity, or comfort—elements often associated with home. Based on my experiences, I have always felt a strong connection to my roots, even when moving to a new city. While I enjoy exploring and engaging with new communities, I also value the comfort and familiarity of home.
