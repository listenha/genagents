She also mentions that she didn't have a lot of money and had to work part-time during high school, which may have contributed to her being more introverted or reserved. She doesn't seem to be someone who seeks the spotlight or enjoys being the center of attention. Her reflections on her life show a thoughtful and introspective nature, which aligns more with being reserved.",

            "BFI-10_4": "Emily has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety and stress, particularly in balancing school, work, and personal goals. She has described moments of feeling overwhelmed, having trouble sleeping, and needing to rely on friends or small self-care routines to manage her mental health. While she is making progress in learning to cope, she has not demonstrated a consistent or confident ability to handle stress well or see herself as relaxed.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Emily has clearly expressed a strong interest in design, mentioning that she was drawn to art as a child, joined a design club in high school, and is now taking online courses in graphic design. She has also described how her passion for design has shaped her life and future goals. This indicates a strong connection to artistic interests, which would place her closer to the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Emily describes herself as someone who values close relationships with family and friends, but she also mentions that she is more of a private person who doesn't use social media much and prefers face-to-face interactions over online ones. She has a small circle of close friends and is described as quiet and more interested in books and art than in socializing. While she is sociable with her close friends and coworkers, she doesn't seem to be the type to seek out large social groups or be the center of attention in social settings.",

She acknowledges her own struggles with anxiety and stress, and she emphasizes the importance of support from others.

There is no indication in the interview that she is judgmental or critical of others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Emily demonstrates a strong work ethic and dedication in her part-time job at the café, where she consistently shows up on time and takes pride in her work. She also mentions working hard in school, balancing multiple responsibilities, and taking online design courses to improve her skills. These behaviors suggest she is detail-oriented and committed to doing a good job, which aligns more with a higher score on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Emily has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety and stress, particularly in balancing school, work, and personal goals. She has described moments of feeling overwhelmed, having trouble sleeping, and experiencing racing thoughts. While she has made efforts to manage her stress, she has not indicated that she is free from nervousness or anxiety. Her self-awareness and honesty about her emotional state suggest she would likely rate herself somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Emily has mentioned her love for art, design, and creativity throughout the interview. She has expressed a passion for drawing, design projects, and even mentioned considering a career in graphic design. These are all indicators of an active imagination. While she is also practical (working part-time, managing her budget), her creative inclinations and interests strongly suggest she would rate herself higher on this scale."

            "BFI-10_1": "Emily describes herself as a quiet kid who was more interested in books and art than in social activities. She also mentions that she didn't have a lot of money and had to work part-time during high school, which may have contributed to her being more introspective. While she has close friends and is connected to her community, she doesn't seem to seek out social attention or express herself in a very outward way. Her personality seems more introspective and reserved.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Emily has demonstrated a strong sense of trust in her life, particularly in her relationships with family, friends, and her community. She has expressed gratitude for the people who have supported her, including her parents, friends like Sarah and Jake, and even her coworkers at the café. She has also shown a willingness to rely on others for support, such as considering counseling and leaning on friends during difficult times. These behaviors suggest she is generally trusting of others.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Emily has demonstrated consistent effort throughout her life, from working part-time while in school, to pursuing design courses, to supporting her family. She has shown resilience, responsibility, and a strong work ethic. She also reflects on her challenges and is actively trying to improve her mental health and time management. These traits suggest she does not see herself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Emily has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety and stress, particularly related to balancing school, work, and financial responsibilities. While she has made efforts to manage her stress through small steps like walking, talking to friends, and journaling, she has not described herself as consistently relaxed or confident in her ability to handle stress well. Her self-reflection shows she is still learning to prioritize her well-being and ask for help, which suggests she would not rate herself highly on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Emily has clearly expressed a strong interest in art and design throughout the interview. She mentioned loving drawing as a child, joining the design club in high school, and currently taking online graphic design courses. Her passion for design is a central part of her identity and future goals, indicating a high level of artistic interest.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Emily describes herself as quiet and more interested in books and art than in sports or parties during her childhood. While she has close friends like Sarah and Jake and values her relationships, she doesn't appear to be the type to seek out large social groups or be the center of attention. She also mentions not using social media much and preferring face-to-face interactions over online ones. This suggests she is more introverted or socially reserved rather than outgoing or sociable.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Emily describes herself as someone who is grateful for the support of her family, friends, and community. She emphasizes the importance of relationships, kindness, and understanding. She also reflects on her own struggles and the value of support from others, which suggests she is more inclined to be empathetic and less likely to focus on finding fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Emily demonstrates a strong work ethic, as seen in her part-time job at the café, her dedication to her online design courses, and her commitment to balancing school, work, and family responsibilities. She also reflects on her growth and the importance of taking small steps to improve, which suggests she values thoroughness and attention to detail in her work and life.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Emily has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety and stress, particularly related to balancing school, work, and financial responsibilities. She has described moments of feeling overwhelmed, having trouble sleeping, and experiencing racing thoughts. While she has made efforts to manage her stress, she has not yet fully resolved her anxiety and still feels the weight of her responsibilities. This suggests she would likely rate herself higher on the scale, closer to 5, but not at the extreme end.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Emily has shown a clear interest in creative activities such as drawing and design, which are closely tied to imagination. She also reflects on her childhood love for books and art, and she has pursued design courses to explore her creative passions. These indicators strongly suggest that she sees herself as someone with an active imagination."
