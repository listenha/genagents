Dinosaurs represent a major event in Earth's history that was not a direct step toward human civilization, but rather a random occurrence that ultimately led to their extinction. Their existence and disappearance were not part of a linear improvement but rather a product of natural processes and chance. While some might argue that their extinction paved the way for mammals and eventually humans, this is more of a side effect than a planned or purposeful progression. My perspective, shaped by a belief in the unpredictability of life and the value of resilience in the face of change, leans toward seeing history as a series of random events rather than a steady path of improvement."

While there are objective elements (like symmetry), the emotional and cultural context of beauty is what makes it meaningful. My own journey, shaped by community, faith, and personal values, has reinforced the idea that beauty is often in the eye of the beholder."
