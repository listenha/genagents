She is reflective, thoughtful, and values emotional connections, but she also shows a willingness to open up and share her experiences, especially in the context of her work and personal relationships. While she may not be overly expressive in all situations, she is not reserved in a way that would lead her to score a 1 on this scale. She is more likely to be open and expressive in her interactions, particularly when it comes to supporting others.",

These traits are inconsistent with seeing herself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Andrea has discussed her struggles with anxiety and stress, particularly during her busiest years, but she has also made conscious efforts to manage it through mindfulness, therapy, and self-care. While she acknowledges that she still has days when stress creeps in, she has developed coping mechanisms and is more aware of her emotional needs. This suggests she is improving in her ability to handle stress, but not yet fully relaxed in all situations.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Andrea Barkley's interview does not mention any engagement with artistic interests or activities. Her focus is on social work, family, community, and practical life challenges.

She frequently mentions her interactions with others, her role in supporting people, and her ability to connect with clients and colleagues.

            "BFI-10_9": "Andrea has discussed her struggles with anxiety, particularly during busy periods in her career and when facing challenges at work or in her personal life. She also mentioned that she used to push through anxiety without addressing it, but now she actively manages it through mindfulness, therapy, and self-compassion. While she has learned to cope, she still acknowledges that anxiety can creep in, especially during difficult times. This suggests she would not rate herself as 1 (completely calm), but she also wouldn’t rate herself as 5 (easily nervous in most situations). Her response is likely to fall in the middle range, reflecting her awareness and management of anxiety.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Andrea Barkley's life story reflects a strong sense of purpose, community involvement, and practical decision-making. While she is passionate about helping others and has a deep sense of empathy, there is no explicit mention of her engaging in imaginative or creative pursuits beyond her work in social services.

However, she also emphasizes that she has learned to manage her anxiety through mindfulness, therapy, and support systems.

She has also mentioned learning to manage stress through mindfulness, journaling, and support systems. While she is resilient and capable, she has not portrayed herself as someone who thrives under pressure—rather, she has emphasized the importance of balance, self-compassion, and support. This suggests she may lean toward agreeing that she doesn't always reason well under pressure.",

While she has made progress, she still acknowledges that stress can creep in, especially with work and future planning.
