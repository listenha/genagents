  "agent_profile_summary": "Andrea Barkley, a 34-year-old social worker in Chicago, grew up on the South Side in a working-class German immigrant family, where her parents' resilience and faith shaped her values. At 17, she chose to pursue a college education over continuing her family's cycle of part-time work, a decision that led her to a career in social services, where she now supports families and individuals at a community center on the West Side. Her work is deeply rooted in the same neighborhood where she once lived, and she remains committed to giving back, much like the mentor who once guided her. Andrea balances her demanding job with a strong sense of family, planning to start a household with her husband, Mark, while also nurturing her younger sister, Lena. Her life is defined by a quiet determination to create stability and opportunity, driven by the belief that no one should face challenges alone."
