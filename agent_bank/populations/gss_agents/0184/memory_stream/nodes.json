Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAndrea Barkley: I was born in Munich, Germany, but I moved to the United States when I was just five years old. My family settled in Chicago, and though the transition was tough at first, I always felt like I belonged here. My parents worked hard to make ends meet, and while we never had much, they always made sure I had everything I needed. I remember my mother working multiple jobs, and my father was a mechanic, but neither had much formal education. Still, they instilled in me a strong work ethic and a deep sense of faith. I grew up in a tight-knit neighborhood on the South Side, where everyone knew each other, and I learned early on the value of community. I was always a good student, and I worked my way through college, earning a bachelor's degree in social work. I wanted to help people, especially those from backgrounds similar to mine. I met my husband, Mark, while I was in college, and we've been together ever since. We got married right after I graduated and have been building a life together in Chicago ever since. It's not been easy, but I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAndrea Barkley: There was a moment that really shaped my path, and it happened when I was 17. I had just finished my junior year of high school, and I was working part-time at a local community center while also helping my mom with her cleaning jobs. One day, I met a woman named Mrs. Alvarez, who was a social worker and volunteered there. She noticed how passionate I was about helping others, even though I didn't have much in the way of resources or guidance. She took me under her wing and started mentoring me, showing me what a career in social work could look like. She encouraged me to apply for a scholarship program that would help me attend college, and I was accepted. That moment was a crossroads for me\u2014on one hand, I could have stayed in the cycle of working multiple jobs to support my family, but I chose to take the risk and pursue higher education. It wasn't easy; I had to work full-time during the day and attend classes at night, but I knew it was the right choice. That experience not only changed my life but also gave me the tools to help others in similar situations. I owe a lot of who I am today to that moment and to Mrs. Alvarez.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nAndrea Barkley: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made in a moment of clarity\u2014it was more like a slow realization. For so long, I just knew I didn't want to be stuck in the same place my parents were, working hard but never really moving forward. When Mrs. Alvarez showed me another path, it felt like a door I hadn't even known was there opened. I remember sitting at my kitchen table that night, looking at the scholarship application, and thinking, 'This is it.' I didn't just want to survive; I wanted to make a difference. I made a promise to myself then that I would take this opportunity, no matter how hard it was. And I did. Every sacrifice I made\u2014every late night, every missed weekend with friends\u2014it all felt worth it because I was choosing my future, not just reacting to the circumstances I was born into.\n\n",

I think if it weren't for Mrs. Alvarez and the community center, I might not have even considered a path like social work. But I also think there are other organizations and people out there who could have made a difference\u2014maybe a school counselor, a teacher, or even a relative who saw potential in me. The thing is, I grew up in a neighborhood where resources were limited, and not everyone had someone like Mrs. Alvarez in their lives. I think that's why I'm so passionate about my work now. I want to be that person for someone else, to show them that there are options beyond what they might think is possible. I believe in second chances, and I know how much one person's belief in you can change everything.\n\n",

Do you have a partner, or children?\n\nAndrea Barkley: Yes, I have a partner\u2014his name is Mark, and we've been married for nearly eight years. We met in college, actually, during my first year. He was studying engineering, and I was working part-time at the community center while taking evening classes. We bonded over our shared belief in making a difference in people's lives, even though our paths were very different. We've built a life together in Chicago, and while we both work full-time, we make it a point to prioritize family. We don't have children yet, but we're planning to start a family in the next few years. Mark is incredibly supportive of my work, and I feel lucky to have someone who believes in me as much as he does. Our relationship has been a journey\u2014there have been challenges, especially with balancing work and personal life\u2014but we've always managed to find a way to make it work. I think the biggest thing that keeps us strong is our shared values and the way we both want to create a better future, not just for ourselves, but for the people around us.\n\n",

Who are they, and what is your relationship with them like?\n\nAndrea Barkley: My immediate family includes my parents, Klaus and Ingrid Barkley, and my younger sister, Lena. My parents are still living in Chicago, though they've downsized a bit and now live in a smaller apartment not too far from where I grew up. They've always been proud of me, even though they didn't have much in the way of education or resources to guide them. My father, Klaus, still works as a mechanic, and my mother, Ingrid, retired a few years ago after working multiple jobs for most of her life.

One person who stands out is Sarah, a close friend from college who also works in the nonprofit sector. We met during our first year, and we've been through a lot together\u2014late-night study sessions, job searches, and even some personal struggles. She's been a huge support system for me, and I know I can always count on her. Then there's my colleague, Jamal, who I work with at the community center.

I also have a small group of friends from my childhood who I still keep in touch with, even though life has taken us in different directions. They remind me of where I came from and keep me grounded.

Tell me all about the neighborhood and area in which you are living now.\n\nAndrea Barkley: I live in a neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago, just a few blocks away from the community center where I first started volunteering. It's a diverse area with a mix of long-time residents and newer families moving in. There are a lot of small businesses, local shops, and community organizations that make it feel like a real hub of activity. I love that there's always something going on\u2014whether it's a food truck on the corner, a local art show, or a neighborhood meeting in the park. It's not perfect, of course. There are challenges, like rising rents and gentrification, which have made it harder for some families to stay in the area. But I see so much resilience here, and I want to be part of that. My apartment is in a building that's been around for decades, and I feel connected to the history of the place. It's not fancy, but it's home. I walk to work most days, and I enjoy the sense of community that comes with knowing your neighbors, even if you don't see them every day. It's a place that's shaped me, just like the South Side did when I was growing up, and I hope to give back to it in the same way I was given a chance.\n\n",

There are parts of the neighborhood where things can get rough, especially late at night, but I've never felt threatened in my own part of the block. I think the sense of community plays a big role in that. People look out for each other, and there's a kind of unspoken understanding that we're all in this together. I've seen neighbors help each other out during tough times\u2014whether it's fixing a broken fence, watching kids while someone works late, or just checking in when someone hasn't been seen in a while. It's not perfect, but I think that shared responsibility helps keep things from getting too out of hand. I also try to be part of that, whether it's volunteering at the community center or just saying hello to the people I pass on my walk. Safety, for me, isn't just about not being harmed\u2014it's about feeling like I belong and that my neighborhood is a place where I can grow, not just survive.\n\n",

On the one hand, the cost of living has gone up, and it's harder to find affordable housing than it was when I first moved here. I remember when my apartment was half the rent it is now, and I used to worry about whether I'd be able to stay in the neighborhood long-term. But on the other hand, there's a real sense of purpose here. I feel like I'm part of something bigger, especially with my work at the community center. I get to see the same faces every day\u2014families struggling to make ends meet, kids who need support, seniors who just want to be heard. It's not always easy, but knowing that I can make a difference in someone's life, even in small ways, keeps me going. I also love the diversity of the neighborhood.

I walk to the center, which takes about 20 minutes, and I love that walk\u2014it gives me time to clear my head and think about the day ahead. My days can vary quite a bit. Some days, I'm meeting with clients, helping them navigate housing assistance or food programs, while other days I'm organizing events or training new staff. I also have a few hours each week dedicated to administrative work, which can be a bit tedious, but I try to stay focused on the bigger picture.

I also try to set aside time for my own well-being\u2014whether it's going to the gym, reading, or just enjoying a quiet evening at home.

It's also the support system I have\u2014whether it's my therapist, my friends, or even just the quiet moments with my parents. What makes it hard, though, is the constant stress from work.

About a year ago, I started experiencing persistent fatigue and some digestive issues that I initially brushed off as stress. But after a few months of it not improving, I went to the doctor, and it turned out I had a mild case of hypothyroidism. It was a bit of a shock, honestly. I never thought something like that could affect me, but once I started taking the medication, I felt like a weight had been lifted. It made me realize how important it is to listen to my body and not ignore the signs. Along with that, I've had some flare-ups of the back pain I mentioned before, especially after long days at work.

How about you?\n\nAndrea Barkley: Honestly, there have been moments when my health challenges made things a bit more difficult, especially with the demands of my job. When I was first diagnosed with hypothyroidism, I felt like I was constantly running on empty, and it made it harder to stay focused during long days at the community center. I remember one time when I was working with a family who was going through a really tough housing crisis, and I felt so drained that I almost couldn't keep up with the emotional weight of the situation. It was a wake-up call for me\u2014realizing that if I didn't take better care of myself, I wouldn't be able to show up for the people who need me most. Since then, I've been more intentional about scheduling rest days, eating better, and even taking short breaks during the workday to breathe and reset. It's not always easy, but I've come to see that my health isn't just about me\u2014it's about being there for my family, my clients, and my community. I want to be strong enough to keep helping others, even when I'm not feeling at my best.\n\n",

On one hand, I've been really proud of how I've been taking my health more seriously, especially after my hypothyroidism diagnosis. It's been a journey, but I feel more in tune with my body and my needs than I ever have before. I've also been really grateful for the support I've received from Mark, my friends, and even my parents. They've been there for me in ways I didn't expect, and that's meant a lot. On the other hand, there have been times when I've felt overwhelmed by the weight of everything\u2014my work, my plans for the future, and even the small things like trying to find affordable housing in a neighborhood that's changing so quickly. I've had to confront some of my own fears, like whether I'm ready to be a parent or if I'm doing enough for my sister Lena. But I've also learned to lean into the support system I have, and that's helped me feel more grounded. I think the past year has been about learning to be kinder to myself, to accept that it's okay to not have all the answers, and to keep moving forward even when it's hard.\n\n",

How about for you?\n\nAndrea Barkley: I think I've struggled with anxiety in the past, especially during the busiest times in my career when I was juggling work, school, and family responsibilities. There were days when I felt like I was carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders, and it was hard to shake that feeling. I used to push through it, thinking that if I just worked harder, I could outpace the stress. But over time, I realized that ignoring it wasn't helping anyone\u2014least of all myself. I started seeing a therapist, and that was a turning point for me. It helped me understand that anxiety isn't a sign of weakness, but rather a signal that I need to slow down, breathe, and take care of myself. I still have days when the anxiety creeps in, especially when I'm facing a difficult case at work or when I'm thinking about the future with Mark and the possibility of starting a family. But now I know how to manage it\u2014through mindfulness, talking to someone I trust, and reminding myself that I'm not alone in this.

My parents were both devout Catholics, and even though they didn't have much in the way of education or resources, they made sure that my sister and I attended church regularly and understood the values of compassion, forgiveness, and community.

It's not about being perfect or following every rule to the letter\u2014it's about trying to live with kindness, and knowing that I'm not alone in this journey. I think that's why I'm still Catholic, even if my practice has evolved over the years. It's a part of me that I don't take for granted.\n\n",

I follow a few local nonprofits and advocacy groups, and I find that their posts often highlight important issues or upcoming volunteer opportunities. I also have a small group of friends from college who I keep in touch with through Instagram, though we don't post too often\u2014more like sharing life updates or photos from our weekends. I'm not really into the more flashy aspects of social media, like influencers or trends, but I do think it can be a useful tool for raising awareness or supporting causes I care about. I've even shared a few stories about my work at the community center, not because I want to be famous, but because I think it's important to show people what we're doing here. I also use Facebook to stay in touch with my parents and my sister, especially since they don't use other platforms as much. It's a way to keep our family connected, even when life gets busy.

That said, there have been a few times when I've posted about my work or shared a story from the community center, and I've been surprised by how many people have reached out with encouragement or even offered to volunteer.

Rent is the largest chunk of my budget\u2014my apartment is in a building that's been around for decades, and while it's not fancy, it's in a safe part of the neighborhood and close to work. I pay around $1,200 a month for that. Groceries are another big one, especially since I try to cook most of my meals at home. I've been making an effort to eat more mindfully, which means buying fresh produce and lean proteins, but it does add up. I spend roughly $400 to $500 a month on food. Transportation is also a significant cost, even though I walk to work most days. I still need to take the bus or ride-sharing services occasionally, especially when I have meetings or need to run errands. That usually comes out to around $200. I also have health insurance through my job, which covers my hypothyroidism medication and therapy sessions, so that's another $300 or so. The rest of my budget goes toward utilities, personal care, and savings. I try to set aside a little each month for emergencies, just in case. It's not always easy, but I've learned to be really intentional about where my money goes. I know how important it is to live within my means, especially with the rising costs in Chicago, and I'm grateful that I've been able to build a stable life despite the challenges.\n\n",

It might go up a bit if we have unexpected expenses, like car maintenance or if we need to replace something in the apartment, but for the most part, it's pretty consistent. The usual breakdown is rent, groceries, transportation, and health insurance, as I mentioned earlier. I also set aside about $200 a month for savings, which might seem small, but it adds up over time. I try to be careful with my money because I know how tight things can get, especially in a city like Chicago where the cost of living keeps rising. I also have a small emergency fund, which I've been building slowly over the years. It's not much, but it gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm not completely at the mercy of unexpected costs.

Renting has always been the reality for me, especially growing up in a family that never had much in the way of savings or assets.

I don't know if we'll ever own a home, and honestly, I'm not sure I want to. There's something about renting that feels more like being part of the community rather than just a homeowner.

In the winter months, my heating bill went up quite a bit, which was a challenge because I was already trying to be careful with my budget. I remember one month when the temperature dropped suddenly, and I had to pay an extra $100 just to keep the apartment warm. Then, come spring, the heating costs went back down, which was a relief. I also noticed that my grocery bills fluctuated depending on the season\u2014during the holidays, I spent a bit more on meals for my parents and Lena, and I also had to buy more fresh produce in the summer when I was cooking more at home. Transportation costs stayed pretty steady, but I did have to replace my bus pass once when I lost it, which was an unexpected expense. Overall, I've learned to plan a little more ahead, like setting aside a small amount each month for seasonal changes, so I'm not caught off guard.

My schedule is from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, but I frequently stay late to wrap up meetings, complete paperwork, or just sit with someone who needs a little more time. There are days when I'm so immersed in a case or a client's story that I lose track of the clock. I've learned to be flexible with my time, especially when someone is going through something really tough. It's not just about the hours\u2014it's about showing up for people in the way they need, even if that means staying a little later or coming in a bit earlier. I've always believed that social work isn't just a job, it's a calling, and that means sometimes the hours aren't as rigid as they might be in other professions. I'm grateful for the work I do, but I also know I have to take care of myself so I can keep showing up for others.\n\n",

When I was in college, I worked full-time at the community center during the day and took evening classes, which was exhausting but necessary to support my family and myself. After I graduated, I focused entirely on my work at the center, though I did take on some part-time freelance writing for local nonprofits to supplement my income. It wasn't much, but it gave me a sense of variety and helped me stay connected to the community in different ways. I think the only time I had two full-time jobs was right after I started working at the center, when I was still figuring out how to balance everything. Looking back, it was a lot, but it taught me a lot about resilience and time management. Now, I'm grateful that I can focus on my work at the center full-time, though I still keep a few side projects going\u2014like writing occasional articles about social work or volunteering with local youth programs. It's not about making extra money, but more about staying engaged and giving back in different ways.\n\n",

Talking about my stress levels and coping strategies reminded me of how far I've come in learning to prioritize my mental health, especially after my hypothyroidism diagnosis. It's no longer about pushing through everything without pause\u2014it's about recognizing when I need to slow down, breathe, and ask for help. Discussing my monthly budget and expenses brought home the reality of living in a city like Chicago, where the cost of living is constantly rising, but also the importance of being intentional with every dollar I earn. I've learned that managing money isn't just about survival\u2014it's about creating a foundation that allows me to support my family, my work, and my own well-being. And when I reflected on my family, especially my parents and my sister Lena, I realized how much they've shaped my journey, and how much I want to be there for them in return. It's a reminder that life isn't just about the challenges we face\u2014it's about the small, meaningful choices we make every day to build a better future for ourselves and those we love.",

That comes from my full-time salary as a social worker, and Mark's income from his engineering job. We've always been careful with our money, especially growing up in a family that never had much. Even now, we live modestly, but I feel like we've built a stable life for ourselves. I know it's not a lot compared to what some people make, but it's enough to cover our basic needs, save a little, and even support my parents and Lena when they need it. It's not always easy, especially with the rising cost of living in Chicago, but I'm grateful for the work we both do and the way we've learned to make it stretch. I think it's a testament to how far we've come\u2014from my parents working multiple jobs to barely get by, to us being able to provide for our own family and still give back to the community.

When I first started, I was still figuring out my place in the field of social work, and I had a lot to learn. But over time, I've come to really value the support and benefits that come with this position. One of the most important things is the health insurance\u2014it covers not only my hypothyroidism medication but also my therapy sessions, which have been crucial for managing the emotional weight of the work. We also get paid time off, which is something I used to take for granted, but now I see as essential for maintaining my well-being. I get about two weeks of vacation each year, and I try to use that time to recharge, whether it's going on a short trip with Mark or just taking a few days to be alone with my thoughts. We also have sick days, which is something I've needed more than once, especially when I've been dealing with flare-ups of my back pain or just needing a day to rest. The benefits aren't just about money or coverage\u2014they're about knowing that I can show up for my clients, my family, and myself without burning out. I think that's why I've stayed here for so long. It's not just a job\u2014it's a place where I feel like I can make a real difference, and that matters more than anything.\n\n",

I have a great relationship with my manager, Sarah Mitchell. She's been a mentor to me since I first started, and she's always been someone I can count on for guidance, even when I'm not sure what the right path is. She's not just a boss; she's more like a friend who believes in me and pushes me to be better. As for my coworkers, I feel lucky to work with a team that's passionate about what we do. We have a lot of different personalities, but we all share that common goal of making a difference in people's lives. I've formed close bonds with a few of them\u2014Jamal, who I mentioned earlier, is one of them. We've been through a lot together, and I know I can rely on him for support, whether it's advice on a tough case or just someone to talk to when the work gets heavy.

He was pretty hands-on, and I remember watching him work in the garage, his hands always covered in grease.
