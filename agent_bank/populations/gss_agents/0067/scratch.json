Now a part-time office worker and tutor, she balances her studies, work, and a commitment to community through volunteering at a local library. Her life is shaped by a tension between ambition and the need for stability, as she navigates financial challenges while striving to complete her degree and build a career in education or community development. Raised in a household where her mother’s work in youth empowerment left a lasting impression, Precious values connection and purpose, often reflecting on how her experiences have taught her resilience and the importance of support systems. She approaches life with a pragmatic yet hopeful outlook, prioritizing growth, self-care, and the bonds that sustain her."
