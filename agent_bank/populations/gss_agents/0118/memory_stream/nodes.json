Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nLorenzo Johnson: I was born in Newark, New Jersey, and I've spent most of my life here, which has shaped who I am in a lot of ways. My parents were divorced when I was young, so I grew up in a single-parent household with my mom. She worked hard to make sure I had everything I needed, and she was always pushing me to do well in school. My dad was around sometimes, but he wasn't really involved in my life after the divorce. My mom has a bachelor's degree, and she worked full-time, so I saw the value of education early on. I was a pretty quiet kid, always reading books or getting lost in my thoughts. I didn't have a lot of money growing up, but we were never in a bad situation\u2014just average. I remember feeling like I had to work twice as hard to prove myself, especially in school, because I was one of the few Black kids in my advanced classes. I ended up going to college on a scholarship, and later I got my graduate degree. Now, I'm back in school again, trying to finish my master's in social work. I want to help people in my community, especially kids who come from backgrounds similar to mine. It's a long road, but I believe in the power of education and the importance of giving back.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nLorenzo Johnson: Yeah, there was definitely a crossroads. I was in my junior year of high school, and I had the chance to apply for a summer internship at a local nonprofit that worked with at-risk youth. I was really torn because I also had the option to take a job at a convenience store to help my mom out with bills. I remember sitting on the floor of my bedroom, staring at the application, trying to figure out what was more important\u2014making money now or investing in my future. In the end, I went with the internship. It was tough because I had to work late nights and weekends, but it changed everything for me. I saw how much impact someone could have by being there for kids who didn't have much. That experience made me realize I wanted to be a social worker. It was the moment I decided my path wasn't just about getting a good job\u2014it was about making a difference in people's lives, especially in my community. I've never looked back since.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nLorenzo Johnson: I think it was a conscious choice, but not in the way you might expect. I wasn't just thinking about my future\u2014I was thinking about the people around me, especially the kids in my neighborhood who didn't have the same opportunities I did. I remember talking to my mom about it one night, and she said something that stuck with me: 'You have a chance to do something bigger than just yourself, Lorenzo. Don't waste it.' That moment made me realize I wasn't just making a decision for myself; I was making a decision for others. I didn't see it as a crossroads in the traditional sense, but more like a responsibility that I couldn't ignore. I chose the internship because I knew it was the right thing to do, even if it wasn't the easiest path.\n\n",

I think if there had been more programs in our neighborhood that supported kids like me\u2014programs that gave us opportunities to explore different careers or connect with mentors\u2014it could have made a huge difference. I remember there was a community center near my old school that used to offer after-school activities, but it closed down a few years before I got to high school. If that place had still been around, I might have had more exposure to what social work even was. I also think organizations that provide scholarships or internships to students from low-income backgrounds are essential. I was lucky to get that internship, but not everyone has that same chance. I wish I had had someone who could have guided me through that decision, someone who could have helped me see the bigger picture before I had to figure it out on my own.\n\n",

She's been my rock through everything, and I don't take her sacrifices for granted. I also have a younger sister who's in college, and we talk often. She's following a similar path to mine\u2014trying to balance school, work, and family responsibilities. I admire her strength, and I try to be there for her as much as I can. I don't see myself getting married anytime soon, but if I do, I want to make sure I'm with someone who shares my values and who I can grow with. For now, my focus is on my studies and making sure I'm in a position to help others the way my mom helped me.

Talking about the crossroads I faced in high school reminded me of the weight of decisions and how one choice can set you on a new path. When I reflected on whether it was a conscious choice or something that just happened, I saw how deeply my sense of responsibility to others played a role. I also thought about how much support I wish I had received from others during those times, and how important it is to give that same support to others now. Finally, thinking about my family reminded me of where I came from and who I want to be moving forward. These questions didn't just ask about my past\u2014they helped me see how my past is still shaping my future.",

One of them is Marcus, who I met in high school through that same nonprofit internship. We bonded over our shared experiences growing up in Newark and our desire to make a difference. He ended up becoming a teacher, and he's been a huge support system for me throughout my education. Then there's Aisha, who's a social worker too, and she's been like a mentor to me. She's the one who encouraged me to apply for my master's program. I also have a few close friends from college who I stay in touch with, even though we're all in different stages of our lives. They've been there for me through the ups and downs, and I know I can always count on them.

It's a place that's constantly changing, and I think that's both a challenge and an opportunity. I live in a small apartment near campus, but I still make it a point to spend time in the neighborhoods where I grew up. There's something about walking through the streets of my childhood, seeing the same corner stores and churches, that reminds me of where I came from. I also try to stay involved in local initiatives that aim to improve education and youth programs, because I know how much of a difference that can make.

There are parts of Newark where I feel safe, especially the areas where I grew up and where I still have a lot of familiar faces. People know each other, and there's a sense of community that keeps things grounded. But there are also parts of the city where I'm more cautious, especially late at night or in areas that have seen a lot of change without the same level of investment. I've had moments where I've felt uneasy walking alone, especially if I'm in a part of town I don't know well. But I try not to let that fear define my experience. I've always believed that safety starts with awareness and community support. I know there are people working hard to make Newark a better place, and I want to be part of that effort. Safety isn't just about avoiding danger\u2014it's about building something stronger, something that protects everyone, especially the kids who are still finding their way.\n\n",

There's a rhythm to life here that you can't find anywhere else\u2014like the sound of church bells in the morning or the way people greet each other on the corner. But it's also a place that tests you. I've seen friends struggle with jobs, housing, and just trying to make ends meet. It's not easy being young, Black, and trying to build a future in a city that still has a lot of work to do. But I also see the resilience every day. People here don't back down. They find ways to survive, to thrive, even when the odds are stacked against them. I've learned to appreciate the struggle because it's part of what makes me who I am.

I usually start my week on Monday with classes at the university, which are pretty intense since I'm juggling a full course load with part-time work at a local community center. I work there a few afternoons a week, helping with youth programs and tutoring. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are mostly about studying and attending workshops related to social work. I try to set aside time each day to read or reflect, especially on the experiences I had growing up and how they shape my approach to helping others. Thursdays are often the busiest day because I have a group meeting with other students in my program, and we discuss case studies and community projects. Fridays are a bit more relaxed, but I still try to stay productive. I might go to a local event or meet up with friends to decompress. Weekends are usually for family time\u2014visiting my mom, catching up with my sister, or just taking a walk through the neighborhood.

About a year ago, I started experiencing persistent back pain, which I initially thought was just from sitting too long at the community center or studying. But after a few months of it getting worse, I finally went to the doctor. Turns out, I had a herniated disc in my lower back. It was a bit of a wake-up call. I had to take a short break from work and school to focus on physical therapy and rest. It was tough because I felt like I was falling behind, but I knew I couldn't keep pushing through the pain. I also had to reevaluate how I was managing my time and stress. Around the same time, I started having more frequent anxiety attacks, which made me realize I needed to be even more intentional about my mental health. I've been working closely with my therapist to develop better coping strategies, and I've also started practicing mindfulness and meditation. It's been a journey, but I'm grateful for the reminder that my health is something I can't ignore.

When I was dealing with the back pain and the anxiety, there were days when I struggled to get through my classes or even show up for work. I had to ask for some flexibility with my schedule, which wasn't easy because I didn't want to let the kids at the community center down. I remember one day, after a particularly bad flare-up, I had to cancel a tutoring session and felt awful about it. But what I learned was that asking for help isn't a weakness\u2014it's a sign of strength. I had to be honest with my supervisor, my professors, and even my therapist about how I was feeling. It forced me to slow down and really listen to my body and mind. I also had to adjust my routines, like taking more breaks during the day and prioritizing rest.

There were moments when I felt like I was carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders\u2014trying to balance school, work, community responsibilities, and my own health. I've had to learn how to set boundaries, how to say no when I need to, and how to take time for myself without feeling guilty about it.

There were times in college when I felt like I was constantly on edge, like I was waiting for something bad to happen, even when I had nothing to worry about. I used to push through it, thinking that if I just worked harder, I could outpace the feelings. But over time, I realized that ignoring it wasn't helping me or anyone else. I started seeing a therapist a few years back, and that was one of the best decisions I've made. It's not that I'm completely free of it now, but I understand it better, and I have tools to manage it. I also try to be open about it with the kids I work with, because I want them to know that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.

It wasn't just about faith for me\u2014it was about belonging, about knowing that no matter what was going on in my life, there was a place where I could feel supported. Even now, attending church on Sundays is something I still do. It's not just about the rituals or the hymns; it's about the people, the sense of purpose, and the reminder that I'm part of something bigger than myself. I think that's why I'm so passionate about helping others\u2014it's like living out the teachings I heard growing up. I may not always have all the answers, but I know that faith has been a part of my journey, and I want to carry that with me as I continue to grow and serve my community.\n\n",

I follow a lot of local activists, educators, and organizations that are doing important work in Newark and beyond. I also use Instagram to post about my journey\u2014whether it's about my studies, my work with kids, or just my daily reflections. It's a way for me to stay inspired and to remind others that they're not alone in their struggles. I try to be intentional about what I share, though.

I also use Facebook to stay in touch with family and old friends, especially my mom and sister. It's amazing how much you can stay connected with people even when life gets busy. I've even started following some social workers and mentors in my field, and it's been really helpful to see how they approach their work.

On one hand, there are times when I'll post about something I'm going through\u2014like a tough day at work or a personal struggle\u2014and I'll get messages from people who relate, who share their own stories, or who just say, 'You're not alone.' That kind of emotional support has been really meaningful, especially when I'm feeling isolated or overwhelmed. I remember one time when I posted about my back pain and the anxiety I was dealing with, and a few people from my community reached out to check in on me. It reminded me that even though I'm trying to be strong, it's okay to show vulnerability. On the other hand, I've also seen how social media can amplify stress or comparisons, especially when I'm scrolling through people's highlight reels and feeling like I'm falling behind. So I try to be mindful of how I use it\u2014focusing on the positive, the supportive, and the real, rather than letting it become a source of pressure.

I live in a small apartment near campus, and the rent eats up about a third of my income. Groceries are another big chunk because I try to eat healthy, but with my schedule, I often end up buying meal preps or eating out more than I'd like. Public transportation is my main way of getting around, so bus passes and the occasional Uber ride when I'm late for something add up. I also had to set aside some money for my physical therapy sessions after the back injury, which was a necessary expense but one that put a strain on my budget. I work part-time and get some financial aid, but it's still tight. I've had to be really careful with every dollar, sometimes skipping things like going out with friends or buying new clothes just to make sure I can cover my essentials.

I also had to cover the cost of a few extra therapy sessions after I realized I wasn't managing my anxiety as well as I thought I was. It's always a tightrope walk, trying to balance everything without sacrificing my health or my ability to help others.

In the winter, heating costs went up a bit because the apartment's heater wasn't working as well as it should, and I had to pay for repairs and extra heating bills. I also noticed that my transportation costs went up during the holidays because I had to travel more for family events and meetings with my program. In the summer, I used to spend more on groceries because I was eating out more often, but I've been trying to cut back on that and cook at home more. Then there's the cost of my physical therapy and mental health care, which has been pretty consistent but still adds up.

I think the key was always knowing when to say no to something that didn't align with my goals or when I needed to focus on what truly mattered. It's not about having more\u2014it's about being intentional with the time and energy I have.\n\n",

Talking about my stress levels and coping strategies reminded me of how far I've come in learning to take care of myself, even when life feels overwhelming. It also made me realize how much my mental health affects my ability to manage my finances and responsibilities. I used to think that being strong meant pushing through everything without asking for help, but now I see that true strength is knowing when to slow down, ask for support, and prioritize my health. When I discussed my monthly budget and how I make ends meet, it made me appreciate how much I've learned about being intentional with my money, even when it's tight. I've come to understand that financial stability isn't just about having more\u2014it's about making the most of what I have and planning for the future, even in small ways. These reflections have helped me see that my journey isn't just about surviving\u2014it's about thriving, even when the road is bumpy.",

It's not much, but it covers the basics\u2014rent, groceries, and transportation. I also get some financial aid and occasionally do freelance writing on the side, which helps a little. It's tight, but I've learned to live within my means and prioritize what's most important. I know it's not easy, especially with the cost of living in Newark, but I'm grateful for every dollar I can get. It's not about having a lot\u2014it's about making sure I can keep going, keep learning, and keep helping others the way I was helped when I was younger.\n\n",

The benefits of the job aren't always the traditional ones you might expect\u2014there's no health insurance or paid vacation days, but what I get instead is something just as valuable: purpose. I know I'm not making a lot of money, but I feel like I'm making a real difference in the lives of the kids I work with. The center also offers some professional development opportunities, like workshops on trauma-informed care and youth engagement, which have been really helpful as I work toward my master's. The best part, though, is the sense of community I feel there. Everyone there is committed to the same mission, and that makes the long hours and tight budget feel worth it. I don't have the same benefits as someone in a more traditional job, but I think the rewards are just as real, if not more so.\n\n",

She's been like a second mother to me, always pushing me to be better while also giving me the space I need to grow. She's seen me through a lot\u2014through my back injury, through the times I've struggled with anxiety, and through the moments when I've felt like I wasn't enough. She never treated me like I was just an intern; she treated me like someone who had a real voice and a real purpose. As for my coworkers, we all have this unspoken understanding that we're in this together. We're not just coworkers\u2014we're a team, and we support each other in ways that go beyond the job. Whether it's helping each other with last-minute projects or just checking in on one another when things get tough, I feel like I'm part of something bigger.

I usually work Tuesday through Friday afternoons, and those days are pretty set in stone. But if something comes up\u2014like a community meeting or a workshop I need to attend\u2014I can usually adjust my hours or swap shifts with a coworker. The center understands that we're all juggling a lot, especially with school and personal responsibilities. That flexibility is something I don't take for granted. It allows me to be there for the kids when they need me most, even if it means staying late or coming in early. I think that kind of adaptability is what makes this place special\u2014it's not just about showing up; it's about showing up when it matters, and knowing that the people around you will support you when you need to be supported in return.\n\n",

She didn't just manage the school; she was deeply involved in every aspect of it, from curriculum planning to student support programs.
