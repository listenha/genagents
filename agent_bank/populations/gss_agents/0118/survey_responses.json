            "BFI-10_10": "Lorenzo mentions being a 'quiet kid' who 'was always reading books or getting lost in my thoughts.' He also reflects on his childhood and how he 'got lost in my thoughts,' which suggests a tendency to use imagination or introspection.

He has also mentioned learning to manage his stress through therapy, journaling, and leaning on his support system.
