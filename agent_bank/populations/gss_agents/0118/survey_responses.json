            "BFI-10_10": "Lorenzo mentions being a 'quiet kid' who 'was always reading books or getting lost in my thoughts.' He also reflects on his childhood and how he 'got lost in my thoughts,' which suggests a tendency to use imagination or introspection.

            "BFI-10_10": "Lorenzo has described himself as someone who reflects deeply on his experiences, reads regularly, and is involved in community work that requires empathy and understanding of others' perspectives. He also mentions his passion for education, mentoring, and helping others, which often involves creative problem-solving and thinking beyond immediate challenges.
