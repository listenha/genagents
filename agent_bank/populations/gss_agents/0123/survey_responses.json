            "BFI-10_1": "Amy Richards describes herself as someone who was shy as a teenager but found confidence through school activities and her career. She is now a mother, involved in her community, and has a close-knit family. She is described as someone who values community, is reflective, and takes time to process her thoughts—such as through journaling and mindfulness. While she is not shy or withdrawn, she also does not appear to be overly outgoing or attention-seeking. She seems to be more introspective and grounded, which aligns more with a middle or slightly higher score on the reserved scale, but not an extreme one.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Amy Richards comes across as someone who values community, connection, and support. She mentions feeling safe in her neighborhood, relying on friends and family, and being grateful for the people who have supported her throughout her life.

These traits suggest she does not see herself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Amy Richards has spoken openly about the stress she experiences in juggling work, parenting, and community involvement. She has acknowledged moments of overwhelm and has had to learn coping strategies like mindfulness, journaling, and relying on her partner. While she has made progress in managing stress, she hasn’t described herself as consistently relaxed or stress-free. Her response suggests she is improving but not yet at the level of someone who handles stress effortlessly.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Amy Richards mentions that she loved reading as a child and that her daughter, Lily, loves drawing and storytelling. This indicates that she has some appreciation for creative and artistic activities, even if she doesn't identify as deeply artistic herself. However, she does not mention any personal artistic interests or hobbies beyond reading and storytelling, which are more literary than visual or musical. This suggests she might see herself as having few artistic interests, but not entirely devoid of them.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Amy describes herself as someone who values family, community, and close relationships, but she also mentions that she is not a big social media user and prefers meaningful connections over online validation. While she is involved in her neighborhood and has a strong support system, she also emphasizes the importance of quiet time, mindfulness, and personal reflection. This suggests she may lean more toward being introverted or at least not highly outgoing.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Amy Richards comes across as a reflective, kind, and community-oriented person. She emphasizes the importance of relationships, values empathy, and shows a strong sense of gratitude and support for others.

She manages her work as a project coordinator, balances parenting, and maintains a structured routine. She also reflects on her decisions and takes time to plan, such as setting aside money for savings and planning meals. These behaviors align with someone who values thoroughness and attention to detail.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Throughout the interview, Amy Richards describes herself as someone who has made intentional choices, is reflective, and has developed coping strategies for stress and challenges. She mentions mindfulness, journaling, and relying on her support system, which suggests she manages her emotions effectively. She does not express a tendency to get easily nervous, and instead emphasizes balance, preparation, and emotional resilience.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Amy Richards describes herself as someone who loves reading, especially as a child, and she mentions how she found confidence through school activities and her studies. While she is practical and focused on family, work, and community, she also reflects on the importance of imagination in her daughter Lily’s life, noting that Lily loves drawing and storytelling—just like she did. This suggests she values imagination, even if she doesn’t describe herself as highly imaginative. However, she is not someone who would score a 5, as she seems more grounded and focused on real-life responsibilities."

She is described as being reflective, thoughtful, and values deep connections with her family and community. While she is not shy or reserved in a way that would make her avoid social situations entirely, she also doesn’t seem to be the type to seek out the spotlight or be overly expressive in a social setting. She appears to be more introspective and grounded, which aligns more with a middle range rather than the extreme ends. However, given her description of being shy in her youth and her focus on meaningful, personal connections over large social engagements, a score of 2 or 3 might be more accurate. But based on her current behavior and personality, she seems to be more open and confident now, so a score of 3 seems most fitting.",

She also describes Lily as 'a bright, curious child who loves drawing and storytelling—just like I did when I was younger.' This suggests that she has some artistic interests, particularly in storytelling and reading, which are forms of creative expression. However, she does not mention engaging in other artistic activities like painting or music.
