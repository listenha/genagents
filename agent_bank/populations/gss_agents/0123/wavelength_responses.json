From my experience in school and in my job, math often involves multiple steps, abstract reasoning, and the ability to apply concepts in different contexts.

For example, I find beauty in my daughter’s laughter, my husband’s kindness, and the quiet moments in our neighborhood. These are all subjective experiences that vary from person to person. While I recognize some universal aspects of beauty, I think the majority of what makes something beautiful is in the eye of the beholder."

From my perspective, a properly functioning smoke detector is a necessary part of life and is not something that would be classified as either annoying or entertaining. However, if it were to be placed on this spectrum, I would lean slightly toward the annoying side because of the potential for false alarms or the loud noise it produces, which can be jarring, especially in the middle of the night."

However, the mention of 'New City' suggests a departure from a familiar environment, which might trigger feelings of homesickness. On the other hand, the imagery of candlelight can also symbolize warmth and comfort, which might suggest a sense of adaptation or even a positive embrace of the new environment. Given my own experiences with moving to new places and the balance between feeling at home and feeling displaced, I think this clue leans more toward homesickness, but not entirely."

I've seen math in my job as a project coordinator involve logical thinking and problem-solving, which adds a layer of complexity.
