Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nKristen Hansen: I was born in Des Moines, Iowa, and I've lived here most of my life. My parents were both working-class people who didn't have a lot of education, just high school diplomas. My mom worked part-time at a local store, and my dad worked in manufacturing. We weren't wealthy, but we had a stable home life. I was a pretty quiet kid, always more interested in books than in sports or socializing. I remember my mom reading to me every night before bed, and that really shaped my love for learning. I went to public school, and while I wasn't the best student, I was determined. I got my bachelor's degree in social work, which I chose because I wanted to help people who were in tough situations, like the ones I saw growing up. Life hasn't been easy\u2014my parents divorced when I was in my early twenties, and I had to step up and take care of my younger brother for a while. I got married once, but that didn't last. Now I'm focused on my job, which is full-time, and I'm trying to save up for a better future. I still go to church every Sunday, and I think that gives me a sense of purpose.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nKristen Hansen: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped my path. I was about 18, just finishing up my senior year of high school, and I had a choice to make. I could either take a job at the local grocery store like my mom did, or I could apply for a scholarship to a community college. I was torn because I knew the job would give me immediate stability, but I also felt like I was being held back. My high school teacher, Mrs. Thompson, saw something in me and encouraged me to go for the scholarship. She even helped me write my application essay. I got the scholarship, and that was the start of my journey toward becoming a social worker. Looking back, I realize that moment was a crossroads\u2014choosing education over immediate work set me on a path to help others, even though it wasn't easy. I had to work part-time while going to school, and there were times I felt like giving up. But I kept going, and I think that decision ultimately made me who I am today.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nKristen Hansen: I think it was a conscious choice, even if it didn't feel like it at the time. I remember sitting at my kitchen table, staring at the scholarship application, and feeling like I was standing at the edge of something big. I didn't have a lot of confidence back then, but I knew I didn't want to end up like my parents\u2014working the same dead-end jobs, never really getting ahead. I made a list of all the reasons why I should go for it, and I kept that list with me every day. It wasn't just about me; I wanted to show my younger brother that there was more out there. So I made the choice, and I stuck with it, even when things got tough. I think that's when I started to believe in myself a little more.\n\n",

I remember reaching out to a local nonprofit that helped students apply for scholarships and financial aid. Their counselor, Mr. Delgado, took the time to sit down with me and walk me through the process. He didn't just help me fill out the paperwork\u2014he helped me see that I was capable of more than I thought. Without his support, I might have stayed in that dead-end job, just like my parents. It was a reminder that sometimes, even when you feel stuck, there are people and organizations out there who believe in you enough to help you take that first step.\n\n",

My parents are both in their sixties now, and they live in the same neighborhood where I grew up. My mom still works part-time at the same store she did when I was a kid, and my dad retired a few years ago after his manufacturing job. He's been helping out with some odd jobs around the neighborhood to stay busy. My brother is in his late twenties now, and he's actually doing pretty well\u2014he went to community college and got a degree in IT. He works remotely for a company in California, which is something I never thought would happen for someone from our background. I still keep in touch with him, and I'm really proud of him. My parents and I don't always see eye to eye politically, especially since I'm a strong Democrat and they're more conservative, but we still have a good relationship. I try to visit them as much as I can, even though my job keeps me busy. Family has always been important to me, even when things got tough.\n\n",

We don't have any other close relatives living nearby, though my mom's side of the family is in Minnesota. I haven't been in touch with them much over the years, mostly because my parents didn't talk about them much when I was growing up.

One of them is Sarah, who I met in college. She was also studying social work, and we bonded over our shared interest in helping others. We've been friends for almost 20 years now, and even though we don't see each other as often as we'd like, she's someone I can always count on. She's the one who encouraged me to stay in the field when things got tough, especially after my divorce. Then there's my coworker, Mark, who's been a great support at work. He's been with the agency longer than I have, and he's always willing to lend a hand or offer advice. I don't have a romantic partner right now, but I think it's more about timing than anything else.

My apartment is in a small complex near the edge of the city, not too far from the downtown area. It's not the most upscale place, but it's safe, and the rent is manageable on my salary. I like that I can walk to the local library, which is a big part of my life. I spend a lot of time there, either reading or volunteering a few hours a week. The neighborhood has a strong sense of community, and I've gotten to know a few of my neighbors over the years. There's Mrs. Alvarez who lives down the hall\u2014she's in her seventies and always brings me fresh bread from her little bakery. Then there's Mr. Patel, who's a retired teacher and loves to talk about books. I think living here has helped me stay grounded, even with everything else going on in my life.

There's a real sense of watchfulness among the neighbors, even if it's just a nod or a wave when you pass by. I've never had any issues with crime, and the local police are pretty responsive if anything does come up. It's not just the safety that makes me feel secure\u2014it's the familiarity, the rhythm of daily life here. I know the routines of the people around me, and they know mine. That kind of comfort is hard to find, especially in a city as big as Des Moines. I think that's why I've stayed here all these years, even though I've had opportunities to move somewhere else.

The library is a big part of that peace for me\u2014it's like my second home. But there are downs too.

I usually start my week on Monday with a quiet morning\u2014coffee, a quick walk around the neighborhood, and then heading to work. My job is at a local social services agency, and I work full-time, so I'm in the office from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. I handle case management for clients who are dealing with housing insecurity, domestic issues, or just need someone to talk to. It's demanding, but I find it rewarding.

I try to take lunch breaks at the same time each day, usually walking to the library and reading for a bit or just sitting in the quiet corner with a cup of tea.

I don't want my health issues to define me, but I do think they've taught me the importance of self-compassion and knowing when to slow down.

It's been a long time since I felt like I was growing in a meaningful way, and that feels really good. On the other hand, there's still a lot of uncertainty. I worry about my financial future, about whether I'll ever be able to save enough to feel secure. I also worry about my parents as they get older. My dad has been having some trouble with his knees, and my mom is still working part-time, which I know isn't easy for her at her age. I want to help them, but I don't want to burden them with my own struggles. It's a lot to balance, but I think I'm learning how to do it.

My mom still works part-time, but she's starting to feel the physical toll of it, especially with the long hours. I worry about them, but I also know they're strong and have always been independent.

I was raised Catholic, and even though I don't go to church every single Sunday anymore, I still find meaning in the rituals and the sense of community that comes with it. My mom used to take me to Sunday Mass when I was a kid, and I remember how peaceful it felt to sit there, listening to the priest speak and watching the people around me. It wasn't just about faith for me\u2014it was about belonging, about knowing that no matter what was going on in my life, there was a place where I could feel connected to something bigger. I think that's why I still go to church, even if it's not as often as I used to. It reminds me of where I came from, of the values I was taught, and of the people who have supported me along the way. I don't claim to have all the answers, and I know that faith looks different for everyone, but for me, it's been a quiet strength that I carry with me.\n\n",

Groceries are another big one, especially since I try to eat healthily, but sometimes I have to stretch my budget by buying in bulk or choosing cheaper options. My car payment is around $250, and I know that's something I could cut back on if I needed to, but I rely on it for getting to work and visiting my parents. I also have a few smaller expenses, like my phone bill, utilities, and the occasional trip to the chiropractor for my back.

I also noticed that during the holidays, my grocery expenses went up a bit because I tend to buy more food for family gatherings or just feel like treating myself a little. But the biggest fluctuation was when my mom had to go to the doctor for a check-up\u2014those medical bills can really add up, especially when insurance doesn't cover everything. I had to set aside some extra money for that, which meant cutting back on other things, like going out to eat or buying new clothes.

One of the most important parts of my job is building trust with the people I work with. It's not always easy\u2014some clients are hesitant to open up, especially if they've been through a lot.

That's not a lot, especially when you factor in the rising cost of living here in Des Moines. I don't have any other sources of income, so it's all on me to make sure we can cover the essentials. I know it's not enough to live comfortably, but it's enough to keep a roof over my head, put food on the table, and take care of my parents when they need help. I've had to make some tough choices over the years\u2014like not going on vacation or skipping out on social events\u2014to make sure I can keep up with my responsibilities. It's not always easy, but I've learned to be resourceful and to prioritize what truly matters. I hope that as I continue to grow in my career and finish those online courses, I can eventually earn more and have a little more financial security. For now, I'm just trying to do the best I can with what I have.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nKristen Hansen: I've been at my current job for about five years now, and while it's not always easy, I've grown a lot in that time. The benefits package is pretty standard for a public sector job\u2014health insurance, dental, vision, and a modest retirement plan. I also get about 10 days of paid vacation a year, plus sick leave and some personal days. It's not the most generous package, but it's enough to cover the basics. I've been lucky to have a good relationship with my supervisor, who's always been supportive, even when I've had to take on more than my share. I think the biggest benefit of this job, though, is the sense of purpose it gives me. I know I'm not making a lot of money, but I feel like I'm doing something that matters, and that's something I can't put a price on.\n\n",

I have a decent rapport with my manager, who I've mentioned before\u2014she's been supportive throughout the years, even when I've had to take on more than my share. She's not the type to micromanage, which I really appreciate, and she's always been willing to listen when I've had concerns or needed guidance. As for my coworkers, we get along well. We're all in the same boat, dealing with the same challenges, and there's a real sense of camaraderie. Mark, the coworker I mentioned earlier, is someone I really trust\u2014when I'm feeling overwhelmed, he's always there to offer a listening ear or a bit of advice. We don't always agree on everything, but we respect each other's work and the fact that we're all trying to do our best. I think that's what makes the workplace feel like a team, even if it's not perfect. There are days when things get stressful or when I feel like I'm not making a difference, but knowing I have people I can rely on makes it easier to keep going.\n\n",

I usually start at 8:30 a.m. and finish at 5 p.m., but there are days when I stay late to wrap up a case or meet with a client who can't make it during regular hours. My manager is pretty flexible, which is something I really appreciate, especially when I need to adjust my schedule for family reasons or when I'm juggling my online courses. That said, I do wish there were more opportunities for remote work or flexible hours, especially as I get older and start thinking more about my long-term health and well-being. For now, the predictability of the schedule is a good thing\u2014it gives me a sense of structure, even when the work itself can be unpredictable. I know I can count on my coworkers to cover for me when I need to step away, and that kind of support makes all the difference.\n\n",

I've always been the type to look at the bigger picture, and I can't help but feel like I'm stuck in a place where I'm not really moving forward. I work hard, I try to be responsible, but I also know that my income isn't enough to give me the security I want for myself or for my parents as they get older. I worry about the future, about whether I'll ever be able to afford something more stable, or even just have a little more freedom in my life. But at the same time, I try not to dwell too much on what I don't have. I remind myself that I have a job that matters, that I have a family who supports me in their own way, and that I'm doing the best I can with what I have. It's not perfect, but I think that's just part of life for a lot of people in my situation. I'm still learning, still trying to figure out how to make things better, and I hope that one day, I'll look back and see that I made the right choices, even if they didn't feel like it at the time.\n\n",

My mom worked part-time at the same local store she's still at today, and my dad worked in manufacturing, which was a steady job but not one that paid well. They both worked hard to make sure we had everything we needed, even if it wasn't much. I remember my dad coming home tired after long shifts, and my mom always trying to stretch the budget so we could afford groceries and bills. I think that's why I chose to go into social work\u2014because I wanted to help people like them, who are working hard but still struggling to make ends meet. It's funny, though, because even though they worked, there were times when I felt like I was the one who had to step up and take care of things, especially after my parents divorced. I guess that's when I really started to understand the weight of responsibility, and how important it is to have a stable income and a sense of security.\n\n",

Both of them had to be really careful with their time, especially since they were working multiple shifts or overtime when needed. I remember my dad coming home with calluses on his hands and my mom always having a tired look in her eyes, even after a short shift. They never complained, though\u2014they just kept working, knowing that it was the only way to provide for us. I think that's why I always felt like I had to be responsible, even as a kid. I saw how hard they worked, and I wanted to make sure I didn't end up in the same situation they were in. It's funny, looking back, because I didn't realize at the time that their work was just as meaningful as anything else\u2014just different.

It's one of those old-fashioned places where the same families have shopped for generations. She was a cashier and also helped with restocking shelves when needed. The store wasn't huge, but it was a staple in our neighborhood, and my mom took pride in knowing the regular customers by name. My dad worked at a manufacturing plant called 'Des Moines Fabrications,' which made parts for construction equipment. It was a union job, which gave him some stability, but the pay wasn't great, and the work was physically demanding. He spent most of his day on the factory floor, assembling metal components. I remember him coming home with sore muscles and a sense of pride, even if he didn't make a lot of money. Both of them worked hard, and I think that's why I grew up with such a strong work ethic.

It's strange how revisiting the details of my life\u2014my childhood, my choices, my struggles, and my small victories\u2014has brought so much into focus. I've always known that I came from a working-class family, that I made the conscious decision to pursue education over immediate stability, and that I've spent most of my life helping others through my work in social services. But putting it all together like this has made me realize how deeply interconnected everything is. My parents' sacrifices, the support I received from teachers and mentors like Mrs. Thompson and Mr. Delgado, the relationships I've built with my brother, my coworkers, and my friends\u2014all of it has shaped who I am today. I've always felt like I was walking a tightrope between responsibility and self-care, between wanting to do more for my family and wanting to build a better life for myself. But now, looking back, I see that I've made it this far, and that in itself is a kind of victory. I may not have everything I want, but I have a purpose, a sense of community, and a family that, despite our differences, has always been there for me. This interview has reminded me that my story is not just about the struggles I've faced, but also about the strength I've found in the people and moments that have carried me through. I'm not done growing, and I know there's still more to learn, but I feel more grounded in who I am than I have in a long time.",
