While she does show some logical thinking (e.g., budgeting, planning for the future), her overall narrative leans more toward emotional and relational decision-making. She seems to value intuition and support from others as much as, if not more than, logic alone.",
            "REI_10": "Kristen reflects on her life with a great deal of introspection, particularly when discussing her crossroads at 18, her career choices, and her personal growth. She often explains the reasoning behind her decisions, such as choosing education over a stable job, or how her parents' work ethic influenced her own values. She also acknowledges the conscious choices she made, like seeking support from mentors and taking online courses. This suggests she has clear, explainable reasons for her decisions."

            "BFI-10_1": "Kristen describes herself as a quiet child who preferred books over socializing, and she still values in-person connections over social media. She also mentions that she doesn't use social media much and prefers to keep her life private. While she is not overly reserved in her interactions with family and coworkers, she seems to value introspection and privacy, which aligns more with a middle to lower score on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Kristen has described her life with a sense of gratitude and has relied on the support of others, including her brother, coworkers, and friends. She has spoken about trusting people like Mrs. Thompson and Mr. Delgado who helped her in her youth, and she relies on her coworkers and friends for support today. She also has a strong sense of community and has expressed trust in her neighborhood and the people she interacts with. These behaviors suggest she is generally trusting.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Kristen has described herself as someone who has consistently worked hard, made conscious decisions to pursue education, and taken on responsibilities such as caring for her brother and managing her job in social work. She also mentions taking online courses and prioritizing her mental health, showing initiative and a strong work ethic. These traits suggest she does not see herself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Kristen has spoken openly about her struggles with stress and anxiety, particularly in her job and personal life. She mentions feeling overwhelmed at times, needing to set boundaries, and even seeking therapy to manage her mental health. While she has made progress in coping, she still acknowledges the challenges of balancing work, family, and self-care. This suggests she does not see herself as someone who handles stress particularly well, though she is working on it.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Kristen's life story and interview do not mention any engagement with artistic interests, hobbies, or creative pursuits. She describes her life as centered around work, family, and community, with no indication of involvement in art, music, or other creative fields. Her focus is on practical matters like financial stability, education, and caregiving, which aligns with the lower end of the range.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Kristen describes herself as someone who is quiet, more interested in books than in sports or socializing as a child, and who prefers in-person connections over social media. While she has close relationships with her brother, coworkers, and a few friends, she does not appear to be someone who actively seeks out social interactions or enjoys being the center of attention. She also mentions that she doesn't use social media much and prefers the quiet of her neighborhood and the library. These traits suggest she is more introverted and not particularly outgoing or sociable by nature.",

She also highlights her relationships with others, including her family, coworkers, and friends, in a positive light. There is no indication that she is prone to finding fault with others; rather, she seems to focus on her own growth and the well-being of others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Kristen describes her job as a case manager in social services, where she helps clients with housing, domestic issues, and mental health. She mentions building trust with clients, being available when needed, and juggling multiple cases. While she acknowledges the challenges of her job, she also emphasizes the meaningful impact of her work. This suggests she takes her responsibilities seriously and is likely to see herself as thorough in her role.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Kristen has mentioned experiencing anxiety, especially during stressful periods at work, and has acknowledged the need to seek support from a therapist. She also described feeling overwhelmed at times and having to adjust her work routine to manage stress. These reflections indicate that she does experience nervousness or anxiety, though she has been working on coping strategies. This aligns more with a mid-to-high range response rather than the lowest end.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Kristen describes herself as someone who is grounded, focused on practical matters like work, family, and financial stability. She reflects on her life with a sense of realism and does not emphasize creativity or imagination as a defining trait.
