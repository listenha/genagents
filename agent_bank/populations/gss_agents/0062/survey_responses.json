She also mentions that she tries to prioritize self-care and find small ways to manage stress, indicating that she may prefer more straightforward solutions to problems. While she has taken on significant commitments like the Entrepreneurship Club and a nonprofit project, these are more about passion and purpose rather than analytical skills.

            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Erin describes her stress levels during exam weeks as high but mentions that she has developed coping strategies like mindfulness practices and reaching out for support. This indicates that while she experiences stress, she is not completely unable to reason well under pressure.
