She also mentions that she tries to prioritize self-care and find small ways to manage stress, indicating that she may prefer more straightforward solutions to problems. While she has taken on significant commitments like the Entrepreneurship Club and a nonprofit project, these are more about passion and purpose rather than analytical skills.

            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Erin describes her stress levels during exam weeks as high but mentions that she has developed coping strategies like mindfulness practices and reaching out for support. This indicates that while she experiences stress, she is not completely unable to reason well under pressure.

While she acknowledges the challenges of balancing multiple commitments, she didn't indicate severe anxiety or panic under pressure. She is aware of her stress but has coping mechanisms in place.

While she acknowledges the stress, she has shown resilience and practical ways to manage it. This suggests she leans towards the middle to upper range of the scale but is not overwhelmingly relaxed. Therefore, a score of 3 or 4 would be more appropriate, but considering the slight edge towards handling stress well, a 4 seems more fitting.",

She mentions that stress spikes during final exams, but she has coping mechanisms in place. This suggests she is not someone who gets nervous easily all the time, but she does experience periods of stress. Therefore, a score of 3 seems most appropriate, but since the range only goes to 5, we will lean towards the lower end of the range to indicate that she does not frequently get nervous.",
