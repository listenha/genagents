    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nErin Schmidt: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to a Protestant family. My parents, both with graduate degrees, were very involved in my upbringing. They emphasized the importance of education and instilled in me a conservative worldview. Growing up, we lived in a middle-class neighborhood in the East South Central region of the state, which has stayed my home base ever since. My parents worked hard, and we always felt secure financially, though not overly so. My mom had a long history of working, which taught me the value of contributing to our household. As a teenager, I attended a local high school and graduated with honors, which opened doors to opportunities at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nErin Schmidt: One such moment came during my senior year of high school when I faced a decision about my future. I was offered a scholarship to attend a prestigious liberal arts college out of state, but it would mean leaving my family and the comfort of home. On the other hand, staying in Tuscaloosa meant attending a university closer to home and maintaining the familiar environment. After much contemplation, I decided to take the scholarship, believing it would open more doors and provide a broader perspective. It was a challenging decision, but ultimately, I'm glad I chose to broaden my horizons.\n\n",

However, I also believed it was a step towards becoming more independent and gaining a broader understanding of the world. Looking back, I can see how that decision shaped who I am today, and I wouldn't change it for the world.\n\n",

They encouraged me to follow my heart and pursue what I believed was best for me. Of course, I can imagine how different things might have been if I had accepted the scholarship earlier or stayed closer to home, but those choices were mine to make.\n\n",

Balancing a rigorous academic schedule, extracurricular activities, and part-time work can be draining, and there have been times when I've struggled to find the time to take care of myself properly. However, I've learned to prioritize self-care, even if it's just a few minutes a day for a walk or a quick meditation session. Maintaining a routine and staying connected with supportive friends and family has been crucial during these moments. While I don't struggle with severe depression or anxiety, the pressure of juggling everything can sometimes feel overwhelming. Reminding myself of why I'm doing this and focusing on small victories helps keep me grounded. Overall, these experiences have taught me the importance of resilience and perseverance, and I feel more equipped to handle future challenges with a positive outlook.",

To cope, I've been trying to implement mindfulness practices like deep breathing exercises and short meditation sessions during breaks.

Rent for the dorms is quite affordable, but textbooks and supplies can add up quickly. I usually allocate about $200 a month for food and snacks, and another $100 for personal expenses like entertainment and small purchases.

From my childhood in Alabama to my decision to accept the scholarship to a liberal arts college, each choice has shaped who I am today. The university environment, with its vibrant community and academic rigor, has provided me with both challenges and rewards. Engaging in extracurricular activities like the Entrepreneurship Club and starting a nonprofit organization has added a new layer of purpose and motivation to my college experience. These commitments have not only enriched my academic and professional journey but also provided a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment. The support from my family and the sense of community at the University of Alabama have been instrumental in helping me navigate these challenges. Through it all, I've learned the importance of resilience, perseverance, and the value of a strong support system. This interview has not just documented my past but has also helped me see the significance of my journey and the impact of my choices.",
