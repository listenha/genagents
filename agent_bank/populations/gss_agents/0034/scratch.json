  "agent_profile_summary": "Isabella Rodriguez, an 18-year-old from Raleigh, North Carolina, grew up in a family that valued education and cultural heritage, celebrating Puerto Rican traditions despite not practicing a formal religion. After high school, she chose to take a gap year to travel across Europe, a spontaneous decision that reshaped her perspective and led her to pursue a degree in international relations. Currently, she works part-time at a local coffee shop while saving for college and volunteering with a nonprofit that supports underprivileged youth—a commitment that reflects her desire to give back. Balancing her studies, work, and personal life, Isabella relies on a strong network of friends and family for support, and she prioritizes mindfulness and routine to manage stress. Her journey from a structured childhood to a self-directed path of exploration and service reveals a person who values growth, connection, and purpose."
