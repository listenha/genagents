            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Isabella describes herself as someone who values her support network and cherishes her friendships, but she also mentions that she prefers a mix of routine and spontaneity in her life. This suggests she isn't overly reserved but also isn't extremely outgoing.

            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Isabella Rodriguez seems to have a generally optimistic and open personality. She values her relationships with friends, family, and mentors, which suggests a tendency to trust others.

            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Isabella discusses her ongoing struggles with anxiety and the strategies she uses to cope, such as journaling and meditation. She mentions that she is feeling more stressed due to college application deadlines and financial uncertainties. However, she also shares that these coping mechanisms are helping her manage her stress levels. Given her awareness of her anxiety and efforts to address it, but still experiencing stress, a score of 3 seems most appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Isabella Rodriguez does not seem to be someone with a strong aversion to art. She has participated in a book club and engages in mindfulness practices, which can be considered forms of creative expression.

            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Isabella seems to value her relationships and the support of her network. She mentions that she tries to stay positive and focuses on the progress she is making.

She noted that she practices mindfulness and talks things out with friends to manage her anxiety. However, she also described her coping mechanisms as being relatively effective. Given this information, it seems she experiences anxiety but does not feel it as a constant or overwhelming presence in her life.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Isabella Rodriguez seems to be a person who appreciates creativity and has taken a gap year to explore and learn about different cultures.

Therefore, she is more likely to disagree with the statement that she is not good at figuring out complicated problems.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Isabella Rodriguez described herself as 'extremely liberal' and discussed her part-time job and volunteering, indicating a focus on social and community engagement rather than intense logical analysis. She also mentioned that she is working part-time and saving for college, which suggests she is more focused on practical and immediate tasks rather than abstract logical problems. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that Isabella would rate herself as a 5 on this scale.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Isabella Rodriguez seems to value emotional connections and cultural traditions. She is described as extremely liberal and not very strong in her party identification, which suggests she may be more open to different perspectives and less focused on rigid, analytical thought processes.

            "REI_4": "Based on the interview, Isabella seems to value spontaneity and has made several significant life decisions, such as taking a gap year and pursuing a degree in international relations, which suggests a more impulsive nature. Additionally, her reliance on support networks and emotional coping strategies indicates that she trusts her instincts and may not always reason things out carefully. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that Isabella would choose a lower number on this scale.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Isabella describes herself as someone who takes time to consider her actions and has developed coping mechanisms like journaling and meditation to manage stress. She also mentions feeling anxious about upcoming college application deadlines and financial uncertainties.

            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Isabella Rodriguez appears to be a reflective and thoughtful individual who values her intellectual capabilities, but she also shares that she has taken a gap year to explore and gain new experiences. This suggests she has a balanced view of herself, neither overly confident nor overly insecure.

            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Isabella Rodriguez seems to be open to learning and exploring different subjects, indicating a willingness to engage with logical thinking. However, she hasn't explicitly mentioned being a highly analytical person.

She reflects on her decisions and provides thoughtful responses, indicating that she considers the reasons behind her choices.

However, she has also described implementing coping mechanisms such as journaling, meditation, and reaching out to her support network. These strategies suggest that she is actively working to manage her stress. While she does experience stress, she seems to have developed methods to cope with it, indicating that she is not entirely at the extreme of constantly being stressed. Therefore, a score of 3 seems reasonable, but given the range, 4 might be more fitting as it suggests she is generally relaxed and handles stress well, albeit not without occasional challenges.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Isabella Rodriguez does not seem to have a strong connection to artistic activities. She mentioned taking a gap year to travel and learn about different cultures, but there was no indication of her engaging in artistic pursuits. Furthermore, her current activities such as working part-time, volunteering, and managing a budget suggest a focus on practical and goal-oriented tasks rather than artistic ones.",

She emphasizes the importance of balancing her emotional well-being and her relationships with practical tasks like working part-time and managing her finances.

However, she has also mentioned implementing coping mechanisms like journaling, meditation, and reaching out to her support network.

She has mentioned that she does not go to college herself and that she has not pursued any formal artistic education or activities.

She noted that she uses various coping mechanisms, such as journaling and meditation, to manage her anxiety. This indicates that she does experience nervousness, but it is not an overwhelming or constant feeling. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that Isabella would fall somewhere in the middle of the range, closer to 3 or 4, but leaning slightly towards the lower end due to her efforts to manage her anxiety.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Isabella Rodriguez seems to value concrete facts and practical experiences. She described her life in a very factual manner, focusing on her daily routines and current life circumstances.
