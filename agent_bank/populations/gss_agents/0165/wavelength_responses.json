However, in casual, social settings—like with friends or at cultural events—it can be a way to connect and have fun.

While it could evoke a sense of wonder or curiosity (wanderlust), the mention of 'new city' and the imagery of candlelight might also hint at a longing for comfort or a connection to home. Given my own experiences of moving from Switzerland to the U.S. and feeling both the excitement of new opportunities and the ache of distance from my roots, I see this clue as leaning more toward homesickness.

While it is not particularly 'zesty' in the traditional sense of being full of vibrant, natural flavors, it does have a distinct, crisp, and somewhat bold taste that sets it apart from bland beverages. However, it lacks the depth and complexity of truly zesty drinks like citrus-based sodas or fresh fruit juices. My personal experience with Diet Coke is that it is more on the neutral to slightly bold side, but not overwhelmingly zesty."

While there may be some objective elements (like symmetry or color harmony), the feeling of beauty is deeply personal. My own experiences with language, culture, and identity have shown me that what one person finds beautiful, another may not. This aligns with my Jewish heritage and the diversity of perspectives I've encountered in my work with immigrant communities. While I recognize that some standards of beauty might be more widely accepted, I think the core of what makes something beautiful is rooted in the individual's perception and emotional response."
