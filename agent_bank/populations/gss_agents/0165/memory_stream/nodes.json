    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nNathan Meyer: I was born in Zurich, Switzerland, to a family that valued education and cultural heritage. My parents were both academics\u2014my father a historian and my mother a linguist\u2014so growing up, books and languages were always around me. We moved to the United States when I was about ten, settling in Evanston, Illinois, where I've lived ever since. It was a big adjustment at first, especially learning English, but I was lucky to have a strong support system. My parents made sure I felt connected to my roots, and I still speak fluent German and Hebrew today. I went to a public high school here, and though I struggled a bit with the cultural shift, I found my passion for social sciences and policy during my undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago. I eventually pursued a graduate degree in public policy, which led me to my current role working with non-profits focused on immigrant integration and social equity. I've never married, and I've always been more focused on my career and community work than on personal relationships. My Jewish faith has been a constant in my life, shaping my values and how I approach the world. I'm proud to be a U.S. citizen now, and I've always felt that my background\u2014being both Swiss and American\u2014has given me a unique perspective on issues like identity, belonging, and the importance of inclusive policies.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nNathan Meyer: Yes, there was a defining moment that shaped the course of my life. It happened during my sophomore year of high school, when I was struggling to find my place in the new culture here. I was still adjusting to life in the U.S., and I felt like an outsider in many ways\u2014both because of my accent and because I didn't always understand the social norms. One day, I was walking home from school when I saw a group of kids from my school organizing a community clean-up in a local park. I hesitated at first, unsure if I belonged there, but I decided to join them. That day, I met a teacher named Ms. Alvarez, who was volunteering with the group. She noticed my hesitation and asked me why I was there. I told her I felt like I didn't fit in, and she said something that stuck with me: 'You don't have to fit in to belong. You just have to be willing to try.' That conversation changed my perspective. I started volunteering more, joined the debate team, and slowly began to feel more connected to my school and community. That experience opened my eyes to the power of community engagement and the importance of creating spaces where people feel seen and heard. It was the moment I realized I wanted to work in social policy\u2014helping others find their place in the world, just like she helped me.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nNathan Meyer: I think, in that moment, it was a conscious choice\u2014though not one I made with full clarity at the time. I was aware that I had a choice: to keep isolating myself or to take a step toward something different. But what made it a choice I could live with was the support I received from people like Ms. Alvarez. She didn't just offer words; she offered a path. I think what made it feel like a decision I could make was that I realized I had the agency to shape my own experience, even in a place that felt so foreign to me. It wasn't just about fitting in\u2014it was about finding a way to be myself while also being part of something bigger. That realization was the first step in understanding that my identity wasn't fixed, and that I could choose to build a life that honored both my roots and my new home.\n\n",

In fact, I think the support I received from my parents was just as crucial. They never treated my struggle with adjustment as a failure on my part. Instead, they encouraged me to explore my interests and connect with others who shared them. My father, for instance, helped me understand that feeling out of place was a common experience for immigrants and that it didn't define my worth. My mother, on the other hand, introduced me to local cultural groups where I could practice my language skills and meet people who had similar backgrounds. Without their guidance and the kindness of people like Ms. Alvarez, I might have remained isolated. I think it's important to recognize that no one has to navigate life's challenges alone\u2014there are always people or organizations willing to help, as long as you're open to reaching out.\n\n",

Do you have a partner, or children?\n\nNathan Meyer: I don't have a partner or children at the moment. My life has been pretty focused on my work and community involvement, and I've always found that my energy is better spent on causes I care about than on personal relationships. That said, I have a close-knit family\u2014my parents still live in Evanston, and we stay in touch regularly. My father recently retired from his university position, and he's been spending more time traveling, which has been a nice way for us to reconnect. My mother still works part-time as a consultant in linguistics, and she's always been a source of wisdom and support for me. I also have a younger sister who moved to Tel Aviv a few years ago. She's a graphic designer, and though we don't see each other as often as I'd like, we keep in touch through video calls and shared family traditions. My Jewish heritage is something I hold close, and I make sure to celebrate holidays with my family whenever possible. While I haven't prioritized a romantic relationship, I don't see it as a lack of interest\u2014it's more about timing and finding someone who shares my values and passion for making a difference in the world.\n\n",

From my early years in Zurich to adjusting to life in the U.S., my story has always been about finding a place where I belong\u2014not just geographically, but emotionally and culturally. The crossroads I faced in high school with Ms. Alvarez's words still resonate with me today, reminding me that belonging is not about fitting in, but about being willing to try. My parents' unwavering support and the kindness of others helped me navigate those early challenges, and that experience ultimately led me to the path I'm on now\u2014working in social policy and immigrant integration. While I may not have a family in the traditional sense, the relationships I've built and the values I hold dear are just as meaningful. I've come to understand that my identity is a blend of my Swiss and American roots, my Jewish heritage, and the experiences that have shaped me along the way. It's a life I've chosen, step by step, with the help of those who believed in me even when I didn't believe in myself.",

My father's family is quite close-knit\u2014my paternal grandfather passed away a few years ago, but my grandmother still lives in Zurich, and we visit her whenever we can. She's the one who taught me how to cook traditional Swiss dishes, and I still make her famous apple strudel for holidays. My mother's family is more spread out; her parents moved to Israel many years ago, and while I respect their decision, I've never felt as connected to them as I do to my father's side. That said, I do keep in touch with my maternal uncle, who lives in Boston. He's a musician, and we've had some interesting conversations about identity and culture over the years. He's always been a good reminder that even within the same family, people can have very different experiences and perspectives. I think that's something I carry with me in my work\u2014recognizing that everyone's journey is unique, and that understanding those differences is key to building a more inclusive society.\n\n",

Are there people outside of your family who are important to you?\n\nNathan Meyer: Outside of my family, there are a few friends and colleagues who have been important to me over the years. One of them is Alex, a fellow policy advocate I met during my graduate studies. We've been working together on several immigrant integration projects, and he's become like a brother to me. He's the one who always pushes me to think more critically about the policies we support and reminds me that our work has real, human consequences. Then there's Rachel, a community organizer I admire deeply. She's been a mentor to me in many ways, showing me how to build trust with people from diverse backgrounds. I've learned so much from her about listening and empathy. I also have a few close friends from my volunteer days in high school\u2014people like Marcus, who's now a teacher, and Lena, who works in social work. We still get together for coffee or holidays, and those connections have been a source of comfort and inspiration. While I don't have a romantic partner, I feel deeply connected to the people I work with and the communities I serve. They've helped shape who I am, just as my family and early experiences did.\n\n",

Tell me all about the neighborhood and area in which you are living now.\n\nNathan Meyer: I live in a neighborhood in Evanston that feels like a small city within a city. It's a mix of old and new\u2014there are historic homes with large porches and well-kept gardens, but also modern apartments and co-living spaces that cater to students and young professionals. The streets are lined with trees, and there's a strong sense of community here. I live in a two-bedroom apartment near the downtown area, which is walkable to cafes, bookstores, and the local library. One of the things I love most about Evanston is its cultural diversity. There are a lot of immigrants and international students here, which makes the atmosphere feel dynamic and ever-changing. I often run into people from different backgrounds at the local coffee shop or during community events, and that reminds me of why I chose this field in the first place. The neighborhood also has a strong arts scene, with galleries and theaters that host performances in multiple languages\u2014something I really appreciate as someone who speaks more than one language. It's not perfect, of course; like any city, there are challenges with housing costs and gentrification, but overall, I feel like I'm in a place that values inclusion and intellectual curiosity. It's a place where I can be both rooted and open to new experiences, which is something I think is really important in life.\n\n",

There's a lot of foot traffic in the downtown area, and people seem to look out for one another. I've never felt threatened or unwelcome here, which is something I really appreciate. That sense of belonging is part of why I chose to stay in Evanston after moving here as a child. It's not just a place to live\u2014it's a place where I can be myself, where my Swiss and American identities coexist without conflict. I know that not everyone feels safe in their neighborhoods, and that's something I'm always mindful of in my work.

The cost of living has gone up significantly over the years, and I've had to make some tough decisions about where to allocate my resources. I've always prioritized my work and community involvement, so I've had to be careful with my budget.

I've been able to build a life that aligns with my values\u2014supporting causes I care about, staying connected to my roots, and being part of a community that feels inclusive. There are days when I feel the weight of it all, especially when I think about how much has changed since I first arrived here as a child.

I usually start my week with a morning routine\u2014coffee, a quick walk around the neighborhood, and checking my emails. Mondays are often the most intense, as that's when I meet with my team at the non-profit I work with. We're currently focused on a housing initiative for newly arrived immigrants, so I spend a lot of time coordinating with local organizations, attending meetings, and reviewing policy documents. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are a mix of meetings, research, and sometimes fieldwork. I love going out into the community to talk to people directly\u2014whether it's at a local cultural center or a community kitchen. Thursdays are usually lighter, allowing me to catch up on reading or attend a workshop. I also try to set aside time for exercise, usually a run or a yoga class, which helps me stay grounded. Fridays are often the busiest in terms of outreach\u2014sometimes I'm organizing events or giving talks at schools or libraries. On the weekends, I like to slow down. I might meet up with friends for brunch, visit my parents, or spend time in the library researching for upcoming projects. I also make sure to set aside a few hours each week for personal reflection\u2014journaling, reading fiction, or just sitting in silence. It's a balance between being productive and being present, and I think that balance is what keeps me from feeling overwhelmed. Even though my work is demanding, I find that the connections I make and the impact I can have make it all worthwhile.\n\n",

I especially enjoy the collaborative environment\u2014we work closely with local government officials, community leaders, and grassroots organizations to develop programs that support marginalized groups. One of the most rewarding parts of my job is when I get to meet with individuals who have recently arrived in the U.S. and hear their stories.

It's a way for me to unwind and connect with the languages and cultures that shaped me. I also make it a point to cook at least one meal from scratch each week, often something from my Swiss heritage like fondue or raclette. It's not just about the food; it's about the memories and traditions that come with it. On weekends, I sometimes visit the Evanston Jewish Community Center, where I attend a weekly discussion group on global politics and culture. It's a space where I can engage with others who share my interests and background, and it's been a great source of intellectual and emotional support over the years. I also have a small garden on my balcony where I grow herbs and a few vegetables. Tending to it gives me a sense of peace, especially after long days of work.

It's something I've been doing to counteract the stress of working on such emotionally heavy issues.

First, tell me all about your health.\n\nNathan Meyer: In terms of my health, I would say I've been fortunate to maintain a relatively good level of physical and mental well-being, though it hasn't always been easy. Growing up in a family that valued education and intellectual engagement, I wasn't always encouraged to prioritize my physical health in the same way. I remember being more focused on books and debates than on exercise, which led to some habits that I've had to work on over the years. In my early twenties, I started noticing the effects of a sedentary lifestyle\u2014chronic fatigue, occasional back pain, and a general sense of being out of sync with my body. That was when I made a conscious decision to change. I started incorporating regular exercise into my routine, first with running and later with yoga, which has helped me manage stress and stay grounded. I also pay close attention to my diet, making an effort to eat whole foods and limit processed meals, though I'll admit I'm not perfect about it. Mentally, I've always been someone who processes a lot internally, and there were times when I struggled with anxiety, especially when I was first adjusting to life in the U.S. and dealing with the pressures of graduate school. Over time, I've learned to lean on my support systems\u2014friends, family, and even therapy\u2014to help me navigate those moments. I think the key for me has been balance: finding ways to take care of my body and mind without feeling like I'm adding more pressure to an already demanding life. It's an ongoing process, but one I take seriously because I know how much my health affects my ability to do the work I care about and be present for the people I love.\n\n",

I also find that cooking at home and eating mindfully\u2014rather than rushing through meals\u2014has a positive impact on both my physical and mental health. What makes it harder, though, is the constant pressure of my work and the emotional weight that comes with it. There are days when I feel overwhelmed by the challenges I see in the communities I serve, and that can make it harder to prioritize my own well-being.

A few months ago, I saw a physical therapist who helped me identify some posture issues and recommended a series of exercises to strengthen my core and improve my flexibility. It's been a slow process, but I've noticed a significant improvement in how I feel, especially after incorporating regular stretching into my routine. I also had a mild flare-up of anxiety earlier this year, which I managed through a combination of therapy, mindfulness practices, and leaning on my support network. It was a challenging time, but it reminded me of the importance of taking care of my mental health just as seriously as my physical health. I've learned that even small changes\u2014like taking short breaks throughout the day or practicing deep breathing\u2014can make a big difference in how I show up for myself and for the people I work with.\n\n",

How about you?\n\nNathan Meyer: While my health issues haven't prevented me from working or caring for others, they have certainly shaped how I approach my responsibilities. There were times when the physical discomfort or emotional strain made it harder to focus, and I had to be more intentional about pacing myself. I've learned to recognize when I need to step back, take a break, or seek support\u2014whether that's through therapy, a walk in the park, or simply talking to a friend. It's not always easy to admit when I'm struggling, but I've come to see it as a strength rather than a weakness. In many ways, these challenges have made me more empathetic to the people I work with, especially those who face similar obstacles. I know how it feels to carry a heavy burden, and that understanding helps me be more patient and compassionate in my work. I don't see my health struggles as setbacks\u2014they've become part of the journey, shaping who I am and how I show up for the people and causes I care about.\n\n",

Tell me all about how you have been feeling.\n\nNathan Meyer: Over the past year, I've been feeling a mix of gratitude and reflection. There have been moments of deep fulfillment, especially when I see the impact of the work I do\u2014whether it's helping a newly arrived family find housing or supporting a community initiative that brings people together. At the same time, there have been days when the weight of the challenges we face in our society feels overwhelming. I think the pandemic has left a lasting imprint on all of us, even if we're not talking about it much anymore. I've noticed a shift in how people connect with each other\u2014some have become more isolated, while others have found new ways to build community. For me, it's been a year of re-evaluating what matters most. I've made a conscious effort to be more present, not just in my work but in my relationships and personal life. I've started setting clearer boundaries between my professional and personal time, which has helped me feel more balanced. I've also been more open about my own struggles, both with my health and with the emotional toll of my work. It's not always easy, but I've come to see vulnerability as a strength rather than a weakness. I think the past year has taught me that life is fleeting, and that the most meaningful things are often the ones we take for granted\u2014like a quiet conversation with a friend, a shared meal with family, or simply feeling like I belong in the world I live in.\n\n",

I've learned that my mental health is just as important as my physical health, and that both require intentional care. The challenges I've faced\u2014whether it's chronic back pain or moments of anxiety\u2014have taught me to be more compassionate with myself and to recognize when I need to slow down.

How about for you?\n\nNathan Meyer: I think I've experienced moments of anxiety, especially during the early years of adjusting to life here and during the intense periods of graduate school. There were times when the weight of it all\u2014feeling like an outsider, the pressure to succeed, and the emotional labor of my work\u2014would leave me feeling overwhelmed. I remember sitting in my apartment late at night, staring at the walls, wondering if I was making a difference or just going through the motions. But over time, I've learned to recognize those feelings for what they are and to respond to them with care. I've started seeing a therapist, which has been incredibly helpful in navigating these emotions. I've also found solace in the small, grounding rituals I've built into my life\u2014like cooking, reading, or spending time in nature. I don't think of my anxiety as something that defines me, but rather as a part of me that I've learned to listen to and manage.

He's always been someone who thrives on intellectual engagement, so the shift from a busy academic schedule to more leisurely pursuits has required some adjustment. My mother, on the other hand, has been more grounded, continuing her part-time work and staying involved in community activities. She's always been the one who reminds me of the importance of balance, and I think that's why she's been a steady presence in my life, especially during the more challenging times. My sister, who moved to Tel Aviv, has been dealing with the complexities of living in a different cultural and political environment, and we've had many conversations about identity, belonging, and what it means to feel at home. While we don't see each other often, those calls have become a source of strength for both of us.

How about you?\n\nNathan Meyer: For me, religion has always been a source of grounding and meaning, though I wouldn't say it's the central force in my life. Being Jewish is deeply tied to my identity\u2014it's not just about the rituals or the holidays, but about the values of community, justice, and resilience that have been passed down through generations. My family always emphasized the importance of tikkun olam, the idea of repairing the world, and that has shaped how I approach my work in immigrant integration and social equity. I still observe the major Jewish holidays, especially Passover and Yom Kippur, not just as traditions but as moments of reflection on where I come from and what I hope to contribute to the world. That said, I don't adhere strictly to religious doctrine, and I find spirituality in many other forms\u2014whether it's in the quiet moments of nature, the connections I make with others, or the work I do to create a more just society.

I have a LinkedIn profile where I share articles, participate in discussions, and keep in touch with professionals who are doing similar work across the country. I also follow a few Jewish community pages and cultural organizations that highlight stories from the diaspora, which resonates with my own background. Instagram, on the other hand, is more of a personal space for me\u2014mainly to follow artists, photographers, and writers who inspire me. I find that social media can be both a tool for connection and a source of noise, so I try to use it mindfully.

I don't often turn to Facebook or Twitter for emotional support, but I do find comfort in the online communities that align with my values\u2014particularly those focused on social justice, immigrant rights, and Jewish culture.

It's the kind of stress that comes from knowing the work I do is important, yet feeling the weight of how much more needs to be done.

My biggest expenses are rent, which takes up about a third of my income, and groceries, especially since I try to cook most of my meals at home. I also have a monthly budget for public transportation, since I don't own a car, and I make sure to set aside money for utilities and internet.

For example, during the winter months, my heating bill tends to go up, and I've had to adjust my budget accordingly. I also noticed an increase in my electricity usage during the colder months because I'm using more lights and appliances to stay warm.

Mondays are typically the busiest, as that's when we hold our team meetings and review progress on our initiatives. I also tend to work late a few evenings a week, especially when we're preparing reports or coordinating with local officials. What I find most rewarding is that even though the hours can be long, I feel like my work has a real impact. I get to meet people from all walks of life, hear their stories, and be part of something that helps them feel more at home in this country. It's not always easy, and there are days when I feel the weight of it all, but I've learned to pace myself and take breaks when I need to.

My work with the Center for Community Integration has been my primary focus for the past several years, and I've found that it allows me to dedicate myself fully to the causes I care about. That said, I have taken on a few side projects on a limited basis\u2014mostly consulting for local organizations on immigrant integration strategies or speaking at community events about policy reform. These opportunities have been more about sharing knowledge and supporting the work I already do rather than taking on additional responsibilities. I think it's important to stay engaged in multiple ways, but I also know my limits. I've learned that trying to do too much can lead to burnout, and I've made a conscious effort to prioritize quality over quantity in both my professional and personal life. I'm grateful for the work I do, and I find that staying focused on one path allows me to be more present and impactful in the communities I serve.\n\n",

The past year has been a time of quiet growth, where I've learned to listen more closely to my body and mind, recognizing when I need to slow down and when I need to push forward. My struggles with stress and anxiety have taught me the importance of emotional coping strategies\u2014like journaling, mindfulness, and spending time in nature\u2014while also reminding me that vulnerability is not a weakness but a form of strength. At the same time, managing my monthly budget and understanding the fluctuations in my expenses has given me a deeper appreciation for the balance between financial responsibility and personal fulfillment. It's clear to me now that taking care of my mental health is just as vital as maintaining a stable income, and both are essential to living a life that feels meaningful and grounded. These insights have not only helped me navigate my own challenges but have also deepened my empathy for others who are working through similar struggles in their own ways.",

That comes from my full-time position at the Center for Community Integration, which pays well enough to cover my expenses while still allowing me some flexibility. I've been careful with my finances, especially with the rising cost of living in Evanston, and I try to set aside a portion of my income for savings and unexpected expenses. While I don't have a family in the traditional sense, I do support my parents when needed, and I've made it a priority to ensure they're comfortable in their retirement. It's not about luxury\u2014it's about stability, and I think I've found a balance that allows me to live with purpose while also being financially responsible.

The benefits of the job are more than just the standard health insurance and paid time off\u2014they include a strong sense of purpose and the opportunity to work alongside people who are deeply committed to making a difference. We have a generous leave policy, including vacation days, sick leave, and even some mental health days, which I've found incredibly valuable, especially given the emotional weight of the work we do.

I have a good rapport with my manager, who I'll call Sarah. She's been a mentor to me in many ways, not just in terms of professional development but also in how she approaches her work with empathy and integrity. She leads with a lot of compassion, which I think is essential in our field, given the sensitive nature of the issues we deal with. I feel comfortable approaching her with questions or concerns, and she always takes the time to listen and offer thoughtful feedback. As for my coworkers, we have a strong sense of camaraderie.

He was a professor at the University of Zurich, and his work often involved writing academic papers, leading seminars, and mentoring graduate students. Even after we moved to the U.S., he continued his research and eventually took a teaching position at a university here, which allowed him to stay connected to his field. He was deeply passionate about his work, and I remember how he would spend long hours in his study, surrounded by books and maps, trying to piece together the stories of the past. His most important duties were not just teaching, but also inspiring students to think critically about history and its relevance to the present. My mother, on the other hand, was a linguist who specialized in language acquisition and multilingual education. She worked as a consultant, helping schools and organizations develop language programs for immigrants and students learning English as a second language. Her most important activities involved designing curricula, conducting workshops, and working closely with teachers to ensure that language education was accessible and effective. She always believed that language was more than just words\u2014it was a bridge between cultures, and she made it her mission to help others cross that bridge. Both of them had demanding jobs, but they always made time for our family, and I think that balance between their professional lives and their personal lives is something I've carried with me throughout my own journey.\n\n",
