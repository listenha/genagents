            "BFI-10_1": "The participant describes themselves as someone who values connection, but also mentions that they have not prioritized romantic relationships and that they are more focused on their career and community work. They also mention that they have a close-knit family and a few close friends, but they are not described as particularly outgoing or expressive. Their introspective nature, focus on work, and tendency to reflect on personal experiences suggest a more reserved personality.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Nathan Meyer has described himself as someone who values connection, community, and inclusion. He has spoken positively about the support he received from people like Ms. Alvarez, his parents, and his colleagues. He also emphasizes the importance of empathy, listening, and building trust in his work with immigrants and marginalized communities. These traits strongly suggest a high level of trust in others.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Nathan Meyer describes himself as someone who is actively engaged in meaningful work, has a structured routine, and is committed to his career in social policy and community integration. He also emphasizes his dedication to personal growth, health, and maintaining a balance between work and life. These traits suggest he would strongly disagree with the idea of being lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Nathan describes experiencing moments of anxiety and stress, particularly related to his work in social policy and immigrant integration. He also mentions that he has learned to manage stress through practices like journaling, mindfulness, and spending time in nature. While he acknowledges the emotional weight of his work, he has developed coping strategies and reflects on his progress in managing stress over time. This suggests he is more aligned with a middle to higher score on the scale, but not necessarily the highest.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant mentions speaking multiple languages, enjoying reading, and having a small garden, which suggests some level of creativity and appreciation for culture. However, they do not explicitly mention artistic interests like painting, music, or creative writing. Their focus on policy work, community engagement, and intellectual pursuits seems more aligned with practical and analytical interests rather than artistic ones.",
            "BFI-10_6": "The participant describes themselves as someone who values connection, but primarily through meaningful relationships rather than large social gatherings. They emphasize deep, authentic connections with friends, family, and colleagues, and while they are engaged in community work, they also mention a focus on personal reflection and balance. They do not describe themselves as someone who seeks out large social events or enjoys being the center of attention. Instead, they seem to value quality over quantity in their social interactions.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Nathan Meyer describes himself as someone who values connection, empathy, and inclusion. He emphasizes his work in immigrant integration and social equity, which suggests a strong focus on understanding and supporting others rather than criticizing them. He also reflects on his own struggles with anxiety and vulnerability, which indicates a tendency toward self-awareness and compassion rather than judgment. These traits align more closely with a low score on this question.",
            "BFI-10_8": "The participant described their work as focused on making a real difference in people's lives, often involving research, community engagement, and policy development. They emphasized the importance of their work and the impact it has on others, which suggests a strong commitment to thoroughness and quality. They also mentioned being intentional in their routines and decisions, which aligns with someone who values doing a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Nathan has mentioned experiencing moments of anxiety, particularly during his early years in the U.S. and during intense periods of graduate school. However, he also emphasized that he has learned to manage these feelings through therapy, mindfulness, and support systems. He described his anxiety as a part of him that he has learned to listen to and manage, rather than something that defines him. This suggests he would not rate himself as someone who gets nervous easily (a 5), but he also wouldn't rate himself as completely free of nervousness (a 1).",
            "BFI-10_10": "The participant describes a life deeply rooted in community work, policy, and social equity. While they are reflective and engaged with their environment, there is little explicit mention of creative or imaginative pursuits such as art, writing, or abstract thinking. Their narrative is more grounded in real-world impact and practical engagement with others, suggesting a more practical orientation."

He mentions moments of anxiety and the importance of mindfulness and self-care, especially in response to the emotional weight of his work.

While he has developed coping strategies like journaling, mindfulness, and spending time in nature, he also acknowledges that stress and emotional strain are part of his experience.

He has also described moments of stress and the need to practice mindfulness, journaling, and other coping strategies to manage it. While he has made progress in handling stress, he does not describe himself as someone who is consistently relaxed or handles stress effortlessly. He acknowledges the emotional toll of his work and has had to learn how to manage it over time, which suggests he would not score at the higher end of the scale.",

He also described a mild flare-up of anxiety earlier this year, which he managed through therapy, mindfulness, and support networks. However, he also emphasized that he has learned to manage his anxiety and has developed coping strategies that help him stay grounded. This suggests he would not rate himself as extremely nervous, but he is not entirely free from anxiety either.",

He often emphasizes the importance of balance, mindfulness, and being present. While he is engaged in his work and community, he also mentions the importance of personal reflection, journaling, and maintaining emotional boundaries.

He has shown trust in others—such as his teacher Ms. Alvarez, his colleagues, and the people he works with. He also values empathy and the importance of belonging, which are closely tied to trust. While he has mentioned challenges with anxiety and emotional strain, he has not expressed a general distrust of others.

He has also described how he has learned to manage these feelings through mindfulness, journaling, and setting boundaries. While he acknowledges that stress is a part of his life, he has also made conscious efforts to develop coping strategies and maintain balance. This suggests he is not at the extreme end of the scale but has made progress in handling stress, placing him somewhere in the middle to higher end of the range.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant mentioned in the interview that they enjoy reading in multiple languages, cooking Swiss meals, and tending to a small garden. While these activities may not be traditionally artistic, they do involve creativity and personal expression. However, the participant did not explicitly mention engaging in artistic activities like painting, music, or writing. Given this, it seems they may not strongly identify with having many artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Nathan describes himself as someone who values connection, especially with friends, colleagues, and the community. He has close relationships with friends, participates in community events, and is actively involved in his work with immigrant integration, which often requires social engagement.

He reflects on his own struggles with belonging and emphasizes the importance of supporting others, especially those who feel like outsiders. He also speaks highly of his mentors and colleagues, showing a tendency to focus on the positive in people rather than finding fault. His work in immigrant integration and social equity further supports the idea that he is more likely to be understanding and supportive rather than critical or judgmental.",
            "BFI-10_8": "The participant has described his work in detail, emphasizing his role in policy analysis and his commitment to making a real difference in people's lives. He talks about conducting research, engaging with communities, and ensuring that policies are informed by real human experiences.

            "BFI-10_9": "Nathan has discussed moments of anxiety, particularly during his early years adjusting to life in the U.S. and during intense periods of graduate school. He also mentioned a mild flare-up of anxiety earlier in the year, which he managed through therapy and mindfulness. While he doesn’t describe himself as someone who gets nervous easily, he does acknowledge experiencing anxiety, which suggests a moderate level of nervousness rather than extreme or frequent.",
            "BFI-10_10": "The participant has shown a strong connection to storytelling, cultural exploration, and creative expression throughout the interview. He reflects on personal and historical narratives, engages with multiple languages and cultures, and has a deep appreciation for literature and community work.
