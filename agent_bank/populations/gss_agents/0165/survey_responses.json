            "BFI-10_1": "The participant describes themselves as someone who values connection, but also mentions that they have not prioritized romantic relationships and that they are more focused on their career and community work. They also mention that they have a close-knit family and a few close friends, but they are not described as particularly outgoing or expressive. Their introspective nature, focus on work, and tendency to reflect on personal experiences suggest a more reserved personality.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Nathan Meyer has described himself as someone who values connection, community, and inclusion. He has spoken positively about the support he received from people like Ms. Alvarez, his parents, and his colleagues. He also emphasizes the importance of empathy, listening, and building trust in his work with immigrants and marginalized communities. These traits strongly suggest a high level of trust in others.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Nathan Meyer describes himself as someone who is actively engaged in meaningful work, has a structured routine, and is committed to his career in social policy and community integration. He also emphasizes his dedication to personal growth, health, and maintaining a balance between work and life. These traits suggest he would strongly disagree with the idea of being lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Nathan describes experiencing moments of anxiety and stress, particularly related to his work in social policy and immigrant integration. He also mentions that he has learned to manage stress through practices like journaling, mindfulness, and spending time in nature. While he acknowledges the emotional weight of his work, he has developed coping strategies and reflects on his progress in managing stress over time. This suggests he is more aligned with a middle to higher score on the scale, but not necessarily the highest.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant mentions speaking multiple languages, enjoying reading, and having a small garden, which suggests some level of creativity and appreciation for culture. However, they do not explicitly mention artistic interests like painting, music, or creative writing. Their focus on policy work, community engagement, and intellectual pursuits seems more aligned with practical and analytical interests rather than artistic ones.",
            "BFI-10_6": "The participant describes themselves as someone who values connection, but primarily through meaningful relationships rather than large social gatherings. They emphasize deep, authentic connections with friends, family, and colleagues, and while they are engaged in community work, they also mention a focus on personal reflection and balance. They do not describe themselves as someone who seeks out large social events or enjoys being the center of attention. Instead, they seem to value quality over quantity in their social interactions.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Nathan Meyer describes himself as someone who values connection, empathy, and inclusion. He emphasizes his work in immigrant integration and social equity, which suggests a strong focus on understanding and supporting others rather than criticizing them. He also reflects on his own struggles with anxiety and vulnerability, which indicates a tendency toward self-awareness and compassion rather than judgment. These traits align more closely with a low score on this question.",
            "BFI-10_8": "The participant described their work as focused on making a real difference in people's lives, often involving research, community engagement, and policy development. They emphasized the importance of their work and the impact it has on others, which suggests a strong commitment to thoroughness and quality. They also mentioned being intentional in their routines and decisions, which aligns with someone who values doing a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Nathan has mentioned experiencing moments of anxiety, particularly during his early years in the U.S. and during intense periods of graduate school. However, he also emphasized that he has learned to manage these feelings through therapy, mindfulness, and support systems. He described his anxiety as a part of him that he has learned to listen to and manage, rather than something that defines him. This suggests he would not rate himself as someone who gets nervous easily (a 5), but he also wouldn't rate himself as completely free of nervousness (a 1).",
            "BFI-10_10": "The participant describes a life deeply rooted in community work, policy, and social equity. While they are reflective and engaged with their environment, there is little explicit mention of creative or imaginative pursuits such as art, writing, or abstract thinking. Their narrative is more grounded in real-world impact and practical engagement with others, suggesting a more practical orientation."

He frequently reflects on his choices, such as his career path, personal routines, and emotional well-being, which suggests he does engage in careful reasoning.

He mentions moments of anxiety and the importance of mindfulness and self-care, especially in response to the emotional weight of his work.

            "BFI-10_4": "Nathan has discussed his struggles with anxiety and the emotional weight of his work, particularly in advocating for immigrant integration. While he has developed coping strategies like journaling, mindfulness, and spending time in nature, he also acknowledges that stress and emotional strain are part of his experience.
