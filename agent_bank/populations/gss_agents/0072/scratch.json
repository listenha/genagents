  "agent_profile_summary": "Juan Guzman, a 23-year-old Guatemalan-born resident of Los Angeles, grew up in a working-class household where his parents ran a small grocery store and restaurant, instilling in him the value of hard work and community. After being unable to afford college tuition, he joined the military at 18, an experience that taught him discipline but ultimately led him to return to education, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration. Now unemployed but actively seeking work in tech support, Juan balances job searching with volunteering at a local tech center, where he helps others develop digital skills. He remains deeply connected to his family, often sharing traditional Guatemalan meals with his parents, and values the support of his community as both a source of strength and a reason to give back. His journey reflects a persistent push toward stability and independence, shaped by the challenges of financial insecurity and the enduring belief in the power of resilience and mutual support."
