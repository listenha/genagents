  "agent_profile_summary": "Carlos Garcia, a 22-year-old born in Spain and raised in Birmingham, Alabama, has built his life on resilience and determination. Growing up in a working-class household where both parents had only high school educations, he made the conscious decision at 18 to forgo college and instead work full-time to support his family, a choice that reflected both his sense of duty and his belief in education as a long-term goal. Now working in a local warehouse, he balances a physically demanding job with a commitment to saving for the future and eventually returning to Spain to start his own business. A devout Catholic, he volunteers at his church and remains deeply connected to his heritage through social media and community ties. His life is shaped by a tension between the need for stability and the desire for change, as he weighs the risks of a new job or career path while striving to build a secure future for himself and a family he hopes to have someday."
