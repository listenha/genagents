            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Carlos described himself as someone who feels isolated at times and has a few close friends from work and church. He also mentioned that he misses the support and companionship of having a partner. This suggests that Carlos is more on the reserved side, as he seems to prefer quieter, more intimate settings and might feel more comfortable around a small group of close friends rather than being the center of attention or in large social gatherings.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Carlos appears to be a person who values trust and relies on the support of his family and community. He mentions the importance of his faith and family connections, suggesting he is open to trusting others. Additionally, his willingness to seek support and connect with others through social media indicates a generally trusting nature.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on the interview, Carlos appears to be a hardworking individual who values education, has a moderate political stance, and works full-time to support himself and his family. He has been focused on saving money and pursuing stability, which suggests a strong drive and motivation. Additionally, he has been actively seeking ways to improve his health and financial situation, indicating a proactive approach to life. Therefore, it is unlikely that Carlos would strongly identify as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Carlos has expressed that he has felt stressed due to his back pain and the physical demands of his job. He has also mentioned that it's a constant battle to manage his stress levels and that he has sought healthier coping mechanisms like yoga and meditation. However, the back pain and the challenges at work indicate that he still struggles with handling stress effectively. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that Carlos would lean towards a lower score on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Carlos describes himself as someone who works hard and focuses on his career and financial stability. He mentions that he spends time at work, commuting, and volunteering at a church, but doesn't explicitly mention engaging in artistic activities. While he is open to support from his family and community, and values his faith, there's no indication of a strong interest in art or creativity. Therefore, it seems more likely that he sees himself as someone with few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Carlos describes himself as someone who feels isolated at times due to the language barrier and a lack of close friends growing up. However, he does mention that he has friends from work and church, and he values the support of his family. This suggests he is not extremely introverted but also not extremely extroverted. Given his circumstances and the support he receives, a moderate score seems appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Carlos seems to value understanding and empathy towards others. He talks about his mother's dedication and the importance of hard work, suggesting a more positive and understanding outlook. He also mentions that his faith gives him a sense of purpose and guides him through tough times, indicating a tendency to see the good in others. Additionally, he focuses on finding healthier coping mechanisms and supporting his family, which suggests a more positive and forgiving mindset.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on Carlos's interview, he seems to value his work and tries to do his best, even though his current job can be physically demanding and stressful. He has expressed the need to be mindful of his health and to find ways to cope with the physical strain, which suggests a level of awareness and thoroughness in managing his well-being. However, the challenges he faces, such as back pain and the physical demands of his job, might occasionally hinder his ability to be as thorough as he would like. Nevertheless, his commitment to improving his health and finding better coping mechanisms indicates a desire to do a thorough job, albeit with some challenges.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Carlos has experienced stress and anxiety, particularly due to his back pain and the physical demands of his job. He has also mentioned that his stress levels have been high, and he has sought support to manage his emotions. While he is not described as extremely nervous, the challenges he faces suggest he is more likely to choose a higher number on the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Carlos described himself as someone who values education and hard work, and seems to focus more on the practical aspects of his life, such as his job and financial goals. He did not mention engaging in creative or imaginative activities or expressing a vivid imagination in his responses. Therefore, it is more likely that Carlos would choose a lower number, indicating a less active imagination."

He described feeling pride in his family's resilience and emphasized the importance of understanding and supporting his loved ones. This suggests he would be able to easily understand and share in his friend's happiness.",
            "BES-A_2": "Based on Carlos's reflections in the interview, he mentions being close to his family and friends, but also discusses challenges with managing his own emotions and physical pain. Given this, it seems more likely that he would find it somewhat challenging to read his friends' emotions, but not to the extreme of choosing 5. He acknowledges having a supportive network but also recognizes the difficulties he faces, suggesting a moderate level of empathy and emotional awareness.",
            "BES-A_3": "Based on the interview, Carlos has shared several challenges he faces, including back pain, financial stress, and the physical demands of his job. These experiences suggest that he is emotionally aware and can understand and relate to others' struggles. Additionally, he has spoken about seeking support and understanding from his family and community, indicating a level of empathy and emotional connection. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that Carlos would choose a higher number on this scale.",
            "BES-A_4": "Based on the interview, Carlos has a strong connection with his family and community, suggesting he is likely emotionally attuned and empathetic. His ability to connect with his mother and other family members indicates he is sensitive to their emotional states. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that Carlos would be good at recognizing fear in his friends.",
            "BES-A_5": "Based on Carlos's responses, he seems to value his family and faith, and has described his relationships as generally good, especially with his mother. He also mentions that his mother's dedication and support have inspired him. This suggests that Carlos is empathetic and has a good understanding of others' emotions. Additionally, his willingness to talk about his feelings and seek support indicates a level of emotional awareness and intuition. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that he would choose a higher number on this scale, indicating he can often understand how people are feeling before they tell him.",
            "BES-A_6": "Based on Carlos's interview, he seems to be someone who values his family and faith deeply and has described himself as a moderate individual. He has also shared that he is trying to manage his stress and back pain through various coping mechanisms, which suggests he pays attention to his own emotional state and that of others. His willingness to seek support and engage in self-care indicates that he is attuned to his surroundings and the emotions of those around him.",
            "BES-A_7": "Based on the interview, Carlos is described as someone who values his family and faith, and has a supportive relationship with his parents. He mentions that he is trying to manage his stress and emotional well-being by engaging in healthier coping mechanisms and seeking support. This suggests that he is likely to be more in tune with his emotions and the emotions of others, including his friends. Given his focus on emotional well-being and his supportive family environment, it is reasonable to assume that he would be able to quickly recognize when a friend is angry.",
            "BES-A_8": "Based on the interview, Carlos Garcia shared that he has a few friends from work and church who are important to him. He described these friendships as supportive, but he also mentioned that he focuses more on his own health and future goals. He doesn't explicitly mention being overly aware of his friends' feelings. Therefore, it seems more aligned with the lower end of the scale.",
            "BES-A_9": "Based on the interview, Carlos seems to have a close connection with his family and community, indicating he likely has a good grasp of social cues and emotional states. He also mentions having a few friends from work and church, suggesting he interacts with a variety of people. However, he does not explicitly mention having exceptional skills in reading emotions, nor does he indicate significant difficulties. Given this, a moderate score of 3 seems most appropriate, but since the range is [1, 5], and he leans slightly towards being able to understand emotions, a 3 would be between 3 and 5. For simplicity, choosing 3 would be the closest to the middle, but since the scale goes to 5, we can reasonably predict a 4 as Carlos seems to have some ability but not perfect understanding."

He also mentioned that he's trying to find healthier coping mechanisms and has sought support from his family and community. Given that he is open to seeking help and acknowledges his challenges, it suggests he is aware of his limitations but not overly confident in his problem-solving abilities. Therefore, he is more likely to choose a lower number on this scale.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Carlos describes himself as someone who works hard and faces challenges like back pain and the physical demands of his job. He also mentions that he's been trying to manage his stress and pain with healthier coping mechanisms, which suggests a willingness to engage with and improve his well-being. However, he doesn't explicitly mention having strong analytical skills. Given his focus on health and resilience, but not emphasizing his logical abilities, a middle range seems appropriate.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview transcript, Carlos describes himself as someone who values hard work, resilience, and faith, but does not specifically mention being analytical or relying on logical reasoning. His reflections suggest he leans more towards practical and emotional coping strategies rather than analytical ones. Given this, it seems more likely that he would choose a lower number on this scale.",
            "REI_4": "Based on Carlos's interview, he describes himself as someone who has faced significant challenges and relies on his family and community for support. He mentions that he made a conscious decision to pursue higher education and save money, indicating that he can be thoughtful about his future. However, he also talks about the stress and pain from his back, which suggests he might not always be able to think things through carefully. His description of reaching for support and engaging in healthier coping mechanisms implies a willingness to consider his options, but he may not always take the time to reason things out meticulously. Given these factors, it seems more likely that Carlos falls towards the lower end of the scale, as he recognizes the importance of careful reasoning but may not always practice it due to the pressures and challenges he faces.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Carlos has experienced physical and emotional stress due to his back pain and work demands. He has acknowledged that the back pain affects his work performance and has considered seeking additional support, indicating he may find certain stressful situations challenging. However, he has also shown resilience and a willingness to address his issues, suggesting he is not entirely helpless under pressure. Given his overall tone and the support systems he has in place, it seems more likely that he would rate himself slightly above the lowest end of the scale.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Carlos has described himself as moderate in his political views and independent in his party identification. He has also mentioned that he works hard and tries to manage his health and finances, but it's not clear if he describes himself as exceptionally logical or analytical. His description of his current job and the challenges he faces with back pain suggest that he may not view himself as particularly better at logical thinking than others.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Carlos describes himself as someone who works hard and values education, but he doesn't explicitly mention being a logical thinker or excelling in analytical tasks. His focus seems more on his family, faith, and managing his health challenges, rather than on logical reasoning. Given this, it's reasonable to assume he would place himself somewhere in the middle of the scale, leaning slightly towards the lower end.",
            "REI_8": "Based on Carlos's interview, he seems to be a person who values hard work and resilience, but also mentions that he has been dealing with back pain and stress. While he recognizes the importance of health and well-being, he does not explicitly mention difficulties with thinking things through carefully. Given his general positive outlook and proactive approach, it is more likely that he would lean towards the higher end of the scale.",
            "REI_9": "Based on the interview, Carlos seems to value his faith and has faced numerous challenges, including health issues and financial stress. While he acknowledges the importance of resilience and support systems, his responses suggest he has a pragmatic and methodical approach to problem-solving. He mentions trying to find healthier coping mechanisms and being mindful of his health, which indicates a willingness to use logical and strategic thinking to navigate his life.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Carlos seems to be someone who values clarity and structure in his life. He described making conscious decisions, such as choosing to work and save money rather than immediately going to college, and he discussed the importance of planning and setting goals. This suggests he is someone who can explain his choices clearly. However, he also mentioned that making a plan for the future was a mix of conscious decision and feeling like the right thing to do in the moment, indicating some flexibility in his decision-making process. Given this, a score of 4 or 5 seems appropriate, but leaning towards 5 as he generally presents a thoughtful approach to his life choices."

He also mentions feeling a bit isolated at times due to the language barrier, which suggests he might not be extremely outgoing. However, he does engage in social activities like church and work, indicating he is not extremely reserved either. Given his balanced nature and the need to be functional in his social and work environments, a score of 3 or slightly below would seem most appropriate. However, since the scale leans towards the more reserved end given his reflections on feeling isolated and the challenges of balancing his social and work life, a 3 or a 4 would be reasonable, but leaning towards the lower end suggests a 3 or 4, with a slight preference for 3 given the need to reflect more introspective moments.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on Carlos's interview, he seems to value family and community support, and he mentions that his relationships with his manager and coworkers are generally good. He also talks about seeking support from his family and the community. This indicates that he is likely to be trusting and open to others. Furthermore, he expresses a desire to pass on the values and traditions he learned from his parents, suggesting a positive outlook and trust in those around him.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Carlos's interview, he has shown a strong commitment to his work and financial goals. He works full-time, saves money, and is considering ways to improve his job situation. His dedication to his future and his efforts to manage his health and finances suggest that he does not view himself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on Carlos's interview, he has expressed feeling stressed and overwhelmed by the physical demands of his job, the back pain, and the long commutes. He has also mentioned that he is currently struggling to manage these stresses and is considering speaking to a counselor or therapist. While he has shown some resilience, his current challenges suggest he does not see himself as someone who handles stress exceptionally well. Therefore, it's more likely that he would choose a lower number on the scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Carlos describes himself as someone who has been working hard and dealing with health challenges, which suggests a pragmatic and focused mindset. He also mentions that religion and faith play a significant role in his life, which might indicate a preference for structured and meaningful activities rather than spontaneous artistic ones. His current job and the physical demands of the work align with a more practical outlook.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Carlos describes himself as someone who feels isolated at times and mentions not having many friends growing up due to the language barrier. He also states that he misses the support and companionship of having a partner. These details suggest that Carlos may lean towards being more introverted or socially reserved. However, he does mention having a few friends from work and church, which indicates some level of sociability. Given the information, a score of 3 seems most appropriate, but since the scale is between 1 and 5, and Carlos shows some signs of wanting and needing social connections, a 2 or 3 might be closer. Considering his current efforts to connect with others and his desire for a partner, a 3 seems the most fitting.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Carlos appears to be a reflective and understanding individual. He values his family and faith, and tends to support his parents and others. His comments suggest he tries to understand situations and the challenges faced by others. This aligns more with the perspective of disagreeing with the statement, as he seems to be more forgiving and supportive rather than critical.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on the interview, Carlos appears to be someone who takes his work seriously and tries to manage his responsibilities carefully, especially considering his physical limitations and the need to balance work and health. He mentions that his job is physically demanding, and he's been thinking about a change to a less physically demanding role. This suggests he values doing a good job but might not always feel capable of being perfectly thorough due to his health issues. However, he seems to aim for thoroughness, so 4 might be a bit high, but 2 might be too low given his efforts to manage his health and work well.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on Carlos' responses, he has shared that he has been dealing with back pain and stress, which can contribute to feelings of nervousness. However, he also mentioned that he has been trying to manage his stress through yoga, meditation, and talking to his mom. This suggests that while he does experience some nervousness, he is not consistently nervous in most situations. He seems to be someone who is proactive in managing his well-being, indicating he is not at the extreme end of always feeling nervous.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Carlos seems to be more focused on practical matters and his current job involves physical labor and routine tasks. He has described himself as having a moderate political view and working in a physically demanding job. While he appreciates his faith and family, his daily life and work do not suggest a high level of engagement in imaginative or creative activities."

He mentioned that he values his faith and the support it provides, indicating a high level of emotional intelligence and empathy.

He has also mentioned seeking support and understanding from his family and community, indicating a level of empathy and emotional connection.

His willingness to open up about his feelings and the support he received indicate a level of empathy and intuition in understanding others. However, he also mentioned that he sometimes feels overwhelmed by his own emotions and stress, which suggests he might not always be as attuned to others' emotions without explicit communication.

He mentions that his mother taught him the importance of hard work and that his faith gives him a sense of purpose.

            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Carlos described himself as a moderate individual with a middle-of-the-road political view and expressed that he has been working hard and dealing with challenges. He didn't explicitly mention any exceptional problem-solving skills but also didn't claim to be bad at it. His cautious and realistic outlook suggests he might place himself somewhere in the middle of the scale.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Carlos mentions that he focuses on practical actions like working hard and saving money, and he seems to rely more on his experiences and support systems rather than deep analytical thinking. He doesn't seem to emphasize logical analysis or complex problem-solving in his responses, which suggests he aligns more with the less analytical perspective.",
            "REI_4": "Based on Carlos's description, he seems to lean towards making decisions based on immediate feelings or practical considerations rather than extensive reasoning. He described facing tough decisions but making them based on what felt right at the time, rather than meticulously analyzing every option. His tendency to rely on his parents' guidance and support when making important life choices also suggests he doesn't always reason things out to the fullest extent. Therefore, it's likely that Carlos would choose a lower number on this scale.",
            "REI_5": "Based on Carlos' description, he has faced several challenges in his life, such as dealing with back pain, financial stress, and the physical demands of his job. However, he has mentioned seeking healthier coping mechanisms like yoga and meditation, and has received support from his family and community. While he acknowledges the challenges, his ability to reflect on his experiences and seek support suggests he is not entirely helpless under pressure. Therefore, it's more likely that he would choose a moderate score rather than the highest score.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Carlos seems to have a moderate view of his logical thinking abilities. He has faced challenges and has had to work hard to stay on top of his studies and job, which suggests he may not feel he excels at logical thinking compared to others. However, he has managed to hold a job and perform well academically, indicating he has some logical thinking skills. Given his self-description as 'moderate' and his acknowledgment of challenges, it's reasonable to predict he would lean towards the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Carlos describes himself as someone who has faced many challenges and relies on hard work and resilience. He seems to value emotional support and community, suggesting a more intuitive side. However, he also shows an awareness of his health and financial situation, which indicates a certain level of logical thinking. Given that he is working to balance various aspects of his life, including his health, finances, and future plans, it suggests a moderate level of logical thinking.",
            "REI_8": "Based on Carlos' responses, he seems to value education and has shown a willingness to make thoughtful decisions, such as taking a gap year to save money before pursuing higher education. This indicates that he is likely to appreciate the importance of careful consideration and thoroughness in decision-making processes.",
            "REI_9": "Based on the interview, Carlos has faced numerous challenges, such as back pain, financial stress, and work-related difficulties. Despite these challenges, he seems to have a pragmatic and resilient mindset, often seeking practical solutions and support systems to manage his life. His reliance on community and faith indicates a preference for support over purely logical solutions. However, given his intellectual background and educational efforts, he does have the capacity for logical reasoning. Therefore, he is likely to lean towards finding logic useful but not to the extreme of choosing 5.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Carlos seems to be someone who thinks carefully about his decisions. He often reflects on the choices he makes and the reasons behind them. For example, when discussing his decision to take a gap year before going to community college, he described it as a conscious decision, but also noted it felt like the right thing to do in that moment. This suggests he tries to justify his choices, even if they are complex or multifaceted."

He also mentions feeling a sense of pride in his Hispanic heritage and the resilience of his family, which suggests he might be more introspective. Additionally, his current focus on work and saving money indicates a more reserved personality. Therefore, it seems likely that Carlos would lean towards choosing 5 on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on Carlos's responses, he seems to value his family and faith deeply and has a supportive network around him. He also mentions feeling supported by his mother and coworkers, which suggests he is not overly cautious or skeptical. However, his experiences with back pain and the physical demands of his job have made him more mindful and possibly more cautious about certain aspects of his life. This suggests he might lean towards being more trusting but not to the extreme of choosing 5. Given his emphasis on support systems and his general approach to life, he is likely to see himself as someone who trusts others but with some reservations.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on the interview, Carlos has shown a strong commitment to his work and financial goals. He has taken significant steps to support his family, work hard, and save money. His efforts to manage his health and find healthier coping mechanisms also indicate a proactive and diligent approach to his life. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would see himself as someone who tends to be lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Carlos has experienced significant stress due to his back pain and the physical demands of his job. He has also mentioned that managing stress has been a challenge and that he feels the need to seek additional support. However, he has taken steps to address his stress through healthier coping mechanisms like yoga and meditation, and he has received support from his family. Given these factors, while he struggles with stress, he is not completely overwhelmed and has shown a willingness to find ways to manage it better.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Carlos described himself as a hardworking individual who focuses on his career and saving money. He also mentioned that he spends time volunteering at a church and occasionally attends mass, but there was no indication that he engages in artistic activities. His emphasis on practical and routine activities suggests a preference for non-artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Carlos described himself as someone who felt isolated at times due to the language barrier and the fact that he didn't have many friends growing up. He also mentioned that he focuses on his career and saving money rather than socializing. However, he does have a few friends from work and church, and he values the support of his family. Given these details, it seems that Carlos is more on the introverted side but not entirely isolated or uncomfortable in social situations.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Carlos seems to be a person who values his family and faith, and focuses on the positive aspects of life. He describes his parents as supportive and inspiring, and mentions that his faith provides a sense of purpose. He also talks about the challenges he faces, such as back pain and financial stress, but does not appear to be overly critical of others. Given his overall positive outlook and emphasis on family and faith, it is unlikely that he would see himself as someone who frequently finds fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on the interview, Carlos seems to value hard work and dedication, but he also mentions that his current job at the warehouse is physically demanding, which can be stressful and time-consuming. He has been trying to manage his health and stress through various methods, indicating a commitment to doing his best. However, the physical strain and the need for extra breaks suggest that he might not always have the luxury of being as thorough as he would like in every task. Therefore, he is likely somewhere in the middle, but slightly leaning towards the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Carlos has experienced stress and nervousness due to his back pain and the physical demands of his job. However, he has also shown resilience and has developed coping mechanisms like yoga and meditation. He has not mentioned frequent nervousness in other areas of his life. Therefore, a moderate score seems more appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Carlos seems to value practical and concrete aspects of life, such as his current job and financial stability. He has mentioned challenges like back pain and the physical demands of his work, which suggest a preference for straightforward solutions and reality over imaginative scenarios. While he values his faith and family, these are more about grounding and support rather than imaginative exploration. Therefore, it is more likely that Carlos would lean towards the lower end of the spectrum, indicating a more practical outlook."

His supportive relationship with his parents and his faith indicate that he is capable of sharing in the joy of others. Additionally, his desire to pass on the values and traditions he learned from his parents, including the importance of hard work and dedication, suggests he can relate to and appreciate the success of his friends. Given these insights, it is reasonable to predict that Carlos would choose a higher number on the scale.",
            "BES-A_2": "Based on Carlos's responses, he seems to value his family and faith, and has described himself as someone who works hard and has faced challenges. He has mentioned that he finds support from his family and community, indicating he is likely attuned to his loved ones' emotions. However, his job and health struggles suggest he may also be focused on his own well-being and could have a slightly more guarded approach to understanding the emotions of others. Given these factors, it is reasonable to predict that he would choose a score closer to 1 but with a slight lean towards recognizing his own limitations.",
            "BES-A_3": "Based on the interview, Carlos has experienced stress and emotional challenges due to his back pain and work demands. He has sought support from his family and social media, indicating a level of empathy and emotional awareness. However, he also mentions that managing his stress and understanding his own emotions is a constant battle, suggesting he can relate to others' feelings but finds it challenging. Therefore, a score of 3 seems most appropriate, reflecting his ability to understand others' emotions but with some difficulty.",
            "BES-A_4": "Based on the interview, Carlos has a strong sense of family and community, which suggests he values relationships and is likely to be attentive to the emotions of those around him. He describes his mother as a constant source of strength and wisdom, indicating he pays attention to others. Additionally, he mentions that his coworkers and friends are important to him, suggesting he interacts with people regularly and is observant. His faith also plays a significant role, which might further enhance his empathy and awareness of others' emotions. All these factors point towards a person who would be highly attuned to the emotions of others.",
            "BES-A_5": "Based on the interview, Carlos has demonstrated a thoughtful and introspective nature, reflecting on his life experiences and the support systems that have influenced him. His willingness to engage in deep conversations about his feelings and the challenges he faces suggests a level of emotional awareness and empathy. Additionally, he mentions the importance of his faith and family, indicating a connection to others that goes beyond surface-level interactions. These traits align more closely with someone who would score higher on understanding others' emotions intuitively.",
            "BES-A_6": "Based on Carlos's responses in the interview, he seems to be a person who values his family and faith, indicating a certain level of emotional awareness and empathy. He also describes feeling supported by his family and community, suggesting he is attentive to others. Furthermore, he discusses the emotional challenges he faces, which implies he is aware of his own and others' emotional states. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that Carlos would rate himself closer to the higher end of the scale.",
            "BES-A_7": "Based on the interview, Carlos has a strong sense of family and community, which suggests he is empathetic and observant. He describes his mother as a source of wisdom and support, indicating he values and pays attention to the feelings of those close to him.

Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that Carlos would choose a higher number on this scale.",
            "BES-A_8": "Based on the interview, Carlos has mentioned that he has a few friends from work and church who are important to him. He describes them as a support system and shares discussions about his hopes and challenges with them. This suggests that he does care about his friends' feelings and tries to be supportive. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would choose 1, as he seems to be aware of his friends' emotions and their impact on him.",
            "BES-A_9": "Based on Carlos's description, he seems to value his family and community, and he mentioned having a few close friends from work and church. However, he also stated that he doesn't have a partner and hasn't had children yet. This suggests he might not have extensive experience in deep friendships, which could indicate that he might find it slightly more challenging to gauge when his friends are happy. Given his description of feeling a bit isolated and the challenges he faces, it's reasonable to assume he might lean towards the middle or slightly towards 1."

He mentioned that he works hard and tries to manage his health and finances, but he also expressed that he has been struggling with back pain and its impact on his job. This suggests that Carlos is realistic about his capabilities and acknowledges areas where he may not be as strong, such as logical analysis, without being overly critical. Given his balanced perspective, it is reasonable to predict that he would rate himself somewhere in the middle of the range.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Carlos described himself as someone who works in a physically demanding job and has faced numerous challenges, including back pain and financial stress. These experiences suggest he might lean towards more practical and less analytical thinking.

While he describes some challenges he has faced, such as back pain and financial stress, he also mentions that he has found ways to manage these through coping mechanisms and support from his family. His mention of his faith and his goal to find a less physically demanding job suggests that he values logical and strategic approaches to solving problems, even if he may not explicitly state his confidence in logic as a method for problem-solving.

However, he has found some coping mechanisms like yoga and meditation, and he does have the support of his family and community. Given that he acknowledges the challenges but has also found ways to manage them, a score of 3 seems appropriate.

Since he has found some ways to cope, a 3 seems more accurate.",

He acknowledges the challenges he faces, particularly with back pain and the physical demands of his job, which suggests he might not feel overly confident in his ability to handle complicated problems. However, his efforts to engage in healthier coping mechanisms and his desire to improve his situation indicate he is not entirely lacking in problem-solving skills. Given this, a score of 3 seems most appropriate, but leaning towards 2 to reflect his self-assessment of not being particularly adept at solving complicated problems.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Carlos has faced significant challenges at work and in his daily life, including back pain and the physical demands of his job. He has also expressed a need to find a less physically demanding role due to these issues. While he values his faith and family, his primary focus seems to be on his health and financial stability. Given his current situation and the physical toll it takes on him, it's reasonable to assume he would not strongly agree with the statement that he is not very good at solving problems that require careful logical analysis. However, since he has not explicitly stated his problem-solving abilities, and given the range, a moderate response seems most appropriate.",
            "REI_3": "Based on Carlos's responses, he seems to value practical solutions and has described his current job as physically demanding, which suggests he might prefer straightforward, hands-on tasks over detailed analysis. Additionally, he has expressed a preference for taking action and making decisions without overthinking, which aligns more with a less analytical mindset.",

He has made several significant life decisions, like working full-time right after high school and taking a gap year to save money before pursuing education. These decisions suggest a preference for practical action over overthinking. Additionally, his comments about finding healthier coping mechanisms and relying on support from his family and community indicate a tendency to trust his instincts and seek immediate solutions rather than meticulously analyzing every detail.",
            "REI_5": "Based on Carlos's interview, he has described several challenges he faces, including back pain and the physical demands of his job. He has also expressed that stress and the physical strain of his job have taken a toll on his well-being and that he is considering a change to a less physically demanding role. Given these challenges, it seems likely that Carlos would identify with the statement that he doesn't reason well under pressure, as he has faced significant stressors that could affect his ability to think clearly in high-pressure situations.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Carlos describes himself as a person who works hard and makes conscious decisions, which suggests a degree of logical thinking and problem-solving. However, he also mentions that he is focused on his physical health and emotional well-being, indicating that he might not be overly confident in his logical reasoning abilities compared to others. He has faced challenges like back pain and stress, which could make him more cautious about overestimating his logical skills. Therefore, he is likely to choose a moderate score on this scale.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Carlos seems to be a practical and determined individual who has faced numerous challenges in his life. He has managed to balance a physically demanding job with saving money and pursuing his long-term goals. This suggests he likely possesses some degree of logical thinking to navigate these challenges. However, he has not explicitly mentioned excelling in analytical or logical tasks, nor has he indicated any particular struggles with logic. Given his balanced approach to life, it is reasonable to assume he leans slightly towards the middle of the scale.",

While he has faced significant obstacles, such as back pain and financial stress, he has demonstrated a willingness to seek support and engage in healthier coping mechanisms. This suggests that he values careful thought and decision-making, even if he might not always have the luxury of time to do so meticulously. Therefore, he is more likely to lean towards the higher end of the scale, indicating that he does have no problem thinking things through carefully.",

            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Carlos appears to be someone who thinks carefully about his decisions and values the importance of having clear explanations. He made a conscious decision to work full-time after graduating high school, considering both his responsibilities to his family and the long-term benefits of education. This suggests that he is reflective and considers the reasons behind his choices. Additionally, he values his faith and the support of his family, which further indicates a thoughtful approach to his decisions. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that he would lean towards the higher end of the scale."

He also expressed a desire to speak with a counselor or therapist, indicating an awareness of his emotional state and the importance of emotional support. While he has not explicitly stated his ability to empathize with others, his openness about his own struggles and his connection to his faith and community suggest he is emotionally attuned and likely able to understand others' feelings.",
            "BES-A_4": "Carlos has shown a strong sense of empathy and support for his family and community. He volunteers at his church, is close to his parents, and values his relationships. He also acknowledges the importance of emotional support, both from family and through social media. While he may not always be the one to 'work out' in a literal sense, his personality and values suggest he would be the kind of person to support his friends emotionally when they are scared.",
            "BES-A_5": "Carlos has described his life in detail, including his feelings of isolation as a child due to a language barrier, his emotional struggles with back pain and work stress, and his reliance on family and community support. While he is reflective and expressive about his own emotions, there is no explicit mention of him being particularly attuned to others' emotions or being able to intuitively understand how others feel. His focus has been on his own challenges, family, and faith rather than on reading others' emotions.",
            "BES-A_6": "Carlos mentions that he is working full-time in a physically demanding job and has been dealing with back pain, which has affected his daily routine. He also talks about balancing work, family, and personal goals, indicating that his focus is on practical responsibilities rather than being influenced by the mood of others. His responses suggest he is more self-reliant and focused on his own schedule, which aligns with a lower score on this question.",
            "BES-A_7": "Carlos describes himself as someone who is close to his family, values relationships, and is actively involved in his community through volunteering and social media. He also mentions having close friends at work and in church, and he seems to be emotionally aware of his own feelings and those of his family. This suggests he is likely to be somewhat attuned to others' emotions, though not necessarily highly sensitive to subtle cues from friends.",
            "BES-A_8": "Carlos mentions having close friends from work and church, and he describes these relationships as supportive and meaningful. He also talks about how he shares struggles and experiences with them, which suggests he is somewhat aware of their feelings. However, he doesn’t explicitly reflect on his awareness of his friends’ emotions in a deep or introspective way, which might suggest a moderate level of awareness.",
            "BES-A_9": "Carlos mentions having a few close friends from work and church, and he describes them as people who understand his struggles and support him. He also discusses emotional challenges, such as stress and back pain, and has considered seeking emotional support through counseling. However, he doesn’t explicitly mention difficulty in recognizing his friends’ emotions, nor does he express a lack of social awareness. Given his ability to form and maintain relationships, it seems unlikely he would score a 1. However, he also doesn’t show strong emotional attunement to others, so a middle or slightly lower score seems plausible."

He also volunteers and engages in community activities, which suggests a degree of social awareness and empathy. However, he has not explicitly mentioned being particularly attuned to his friends' emotions, and he has focused more on his own challenges and future goals.

He shows understanding of others' struggles, especially those with similar backgrounds. However, he doesn't explicitly mention being able to sense others' emotions without them being expressed. Given that he is reflective and connected to his community, he may score mid-range, but not the highest, as he doesn’t describe a strong intuitive sense of others' feelings.",

            "BES-A_1": "Carlos demonstrates a strong sense of empathy throughout the interview, especially when discussing his family, faith, and community. He talks about his parents' sacrifices, his close relationships with coworkers and friends, and his ability to connect with others through shared experiences. His emotional awareness and ability to relate to others' feelings suggest he would score high on this question.",
            "BES-A_2": "Carlos has described having a close-knit group of friends, particularly from work and church, and has mentioned feeling connected to others who share similar backgrounds. He also has a strong sense of community and empathy, which suggests he is attuned to others' emotions. This makes it unlikely he would score a 5. However, he has also mentioned feeling isolated in the past due to language barriers and not having many friends growing up, which might make it harder for him to interpret others' emotions accurately. Still, his current social connections and emotional maturity suggest he is more likely to score on the lower end of the scale.",
            "BES-A_3": "Carlos has shown a strong emotional connection to his family, particularly his parents, and has expressed feelings of stress, worry, and the need for emotional support. He also mentioned using social media to reach out for support during tough times, which indicates a capacity for understanding others' emotions. While he has not explicitly discussed his ability to empathize with others, his openness about his own emotional struggles and his reliance on family and community support suggest a moderate to high level of empathy.",
            "BES-A_4": "Carlos is described as a hardworking, family-oriented individual who is resilient and responsible. While he is close to his friends and coworkers, especially those from similar backgrounds, there is no explicit mention of him taking the lead or being the one to reassure others in moments of fear. He seems more focused on his personal goals and responsibilities, rather than stepping into a leadership role in social situations.",
            "BES-A_5": "Carlos mentions feeling isolated during his childhood due to language barriers and being aware of his parents' struggles. He also shows empathy in his interactions with coworkers and friends, volunteering at church, and supporting his family. However, he doesn't explicitly describe being able to intuit others' emotions without them stating it. His empathy seems more reactive than intuitive, so a mid-range score is likely.",
            "BES-A_6": "Carlos mentions that he enjoys walking his dog after work as a way to stay active and that he tries to maintain a routine. However, he also notes that his job is physically demanding and that he is dealing with back pain, which can make it harder to stay motivated. While he values his faith and community, there is no direct mention of being influenced by the cheerfulness of others in his exercise routine. His focus seems more on personal goals and health challenges rather than the mood of others.",
            "BES-A_7": "Carlos describes himself as someone who values family and faith, and he has a strong support system through friends and coworkers. He also mentions being close to his parents and having a few close friends from work and church. However, he does not explicitly mention being particularly attuned to others' emotions or being able to detect when someone is angry. He seems more focused on his own challenges and goals rather than on reading others' emotional states.",
            "BES-A_8": "Carlos has mentioned having close friends from work and church, and he describes these relationships as important to him. He also talks about feeling connected to others and being part of a community. This suggests he is socially engaged and likely aware of his friends' feelings.",
            "BES-A_9": "Carlos has mentioned having a close-knit group of friends from work and church, and he values community and relationships. He also reflects on his emotional state and the importance of support systems, which suggests he is somewhat emotionally aware. However, he has not explicitly discussed his ability to read his friends' emotions or happiness. Given his social connections and reflective nature, he is likely somewhere in the middle, but not at the highest level of emotional awareness."

He also focuses on personal values and community rather than detailed logical analysis.",

However, he does not emphasize logical reasoning as a core strength. Instead, he relies on experience, family support, and practical steps to navigate challenges. He also acknowledges the importance of faith and community, which suggests a more holistic, less strictly logical approach to decision-making.",

He reflects on his life choices, weighs pros and cons (e.g., deciding to work instead of go to college, considering a job change for better health), and shows a clear understanding of his goals and values. This indicates he thinks things through carefully.",

He makes deliberate choices, such as saving money, planning for the future, and evaluating job options. This suggests he uses logical reasoning to navigate challenges, even though he also values faith and community support. His thoughtful approach aligns more with someone who finds logic useful.",
            "REI_10": "Carlos frequently reflects on his decisions, such as choosing to work full-time instead of going to college, or considering a job change to reduce physical strain. He also explains his motivations, like wanting to support his family, save money, and return to Spain. These behaviors suggest he tends to have clear, explainable reasons for his decisions."

While he has shown resilience and a positive attitude, he also mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times and considering seeking help for stress and emotional coping. This suggests he is not entirely free from nervousness, but it doesn’t seem to dominate his life to the extent of a 5.

He talks about supporting friends, sharing experiences, and understanding others' struggles. This suggests he is capable of empathizing with others' successes and feeling happy for them.",
            "BES-A_2": "Carlos has described having a close-knit group of friends, especially from work and church, and he mentions feeling connected to them. He also shows emotional awareness in his own life, such as discussing his stress and seeking support. This suggests he is reasonably in tune with others' emotions, though not necessarily highly attuned to subtle cues like fear in friends.",
            "BES-A_3": "Carlos has mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times and has sought emotional support from his family and through social media groups. He also volunteers at his church and has a strong connection to his faith, which provides him with emotional grounding. These factors suggest he is capable of understanding others' emotions, especially those who are going through similar struggles, such as stress, health issues, or financial challenges.",
            "BES-A_4": "Carlos demonstrates a strong sense of independence and responsibility, as seen in his decision to forgo college to support his family and his determination to work hard despite physical challenges. He also shows a clear sense of purpose and is focused on his long-term goals, such as returning to Spain and starting a business. This suggests he is more likely to act on his own rather than be deterred by others' fears.",
            "BES-A_5": "Carlos shows a strong connection to his family and community, and he is reflective about his own emotions and the emotions of others, such as when he discusses his parents' support and the emotional impact of his back pain. However, he doesn't explicitly mention being able to intuit others' feelings without them stating it. His empathy is present, but it's more reactive than intuitive.",
            "BES-A_6": "Carlos mentions that he feels stress and back pain, which affects his ability to work out. He also notes that he tries to stay active by walking his dog or doing light exercise, but his job is physically demanding. He does not explicitly mention being influenced by others' moods or being cheerful around others. Given his focus on personal health and routine, it seems he is more self-motivated rather than influenced by others' cheerfulness.",
            "BES-A_7": "Carlos describes himself as someone who values family and faith, and he has close relationships with his parents and friends. He also mentions spending time with coworkers and friends from church, indicating he is socially engaged. However, he does not explicitly mention being particularly attuned to others' emotions or nonverbal cues. His responses suggest he is observant and caring, but not necessarily hyper-aware of others' emotional states.",
            "BES-A_8": "Carlos mentions having friends from work and church, and describes them as important to him. He also discusses how he connects with others through shared experiences and values. This suggests he is somewhat aware of his friends' feelings and values their emotional connections. However, he does not explicitly mention being deeply attuned to their emotions, so a middle range is more likely.",
            "BES-A_9": "Carlos mentions having a few close friends from work and church, and he describes them as important to him. He also talks about shared backgrounds and mutual support, which suggests he has meaningful relationships. While he doesn't explicitly discuss his ability to read his friends' emotions, his level of social engagement and emotional awareness (e.g., volunteering, attending church, and discussing personal and family matters) indicates he is reasonably in tune with others' feelings."

            "REI_1": "Carlos has described his life as one of resilience and determination, often focusing on hard work, saving money, and planning for the future. While he has faced challenges such as back pain and physical strain from his job, he has shown a clear ability to make decisions, plan for the future, and navigate difficult situations (e.g., choosing to work full-time instead of going to college, managing his finances, and seeking physical therapy). These traits suggest he has a reasonable level of confidence in his problem-solving abilities, even if he doesn't see himself as exceptional.",
            "REI_2": "Carlos has demonstrated a strong work ethic, problem-solving in his job (e.g., managing physical demands, planning for the future, budgeting), and has shown resilience in making decisions about his education and career. He also reflects on his life and goals with a clear, structured mindset, suggesting he is capable of logical analysis.",
            "REI_3": "Carlos describes himself as someone who values hard work, family, and faith, and has made practical life decisions based on experience and emotional considerations (e.g., choosing to work full-time instead of going to college, prioritizing saving money, and relying on social support). He does not emphasize logical analysis or problem-solving in a structured way, suggesting he may not see himself as highly analytical.",
            "REI_4": "Carlos demonstrates thoughtful reflection throughout the interview, considering his options carefully, such as weighing the pros and cons of changing jobs, planning for the future, and making decisions about education and health.

            "REI_5": "Carlos has described facing physical and emotional challenges, such as back pain and work-related stress, which may affect his ability to think clearly under pressure. However, he has also shown resilience, determination, and a proactive approach to managing his health and future. He is aware of his limitations but is also taking steps to improve his situation, which suggests he may not strongly agree with the statement.",
            "REI_6": "Carlos has shown a practical, goal-oriented mindset, but he hasn't emphasized logical reasoning as a key strength. He tends to reflect on his experiences, values, and emotions, such as his faith, family, and health, which suggests he may not see himself as particularly strong in logical reasoning compared to others. His decisions, such as choosing to work full-time instead of going to college, were based on practical considerations and family responsibilities, not necessarily logical analysis.",
            "REI_7": "Carlos describes himself as someone who made practical decisions based on his family's needs, such as choosing to work full-time instead of going to college immediately. He also shows a clear, structured approach to his life goals, like saving money and planning for the future. However, he does not explicitly mention logical thinking as a defining trait, and his responses lean more toward emotional and practical decision-making rather than abstract or analytical reasoning.",
            "REI_8": "Carlos demonstrates careful thinking in several parts of the interview, such as when he reflects on his decision to forgo college and work full-time, when he considers changing jobs to reduce physical strain, and when he plans for his future. He also shows thoughtfulness in managing his finances and health. These behaviors suggest he is someone who values and engages in careful thinking.",
            "REI_9": "Carlos often reflects on his decisions and considers future goals, such as saving money, changing jobs, and planning for a family. He also seeks advice from others, like his parents and coworkers, and engages in self-reflection. However, he does not explicitly mention using logic as a primary method for problem-solving. His approach seems more intuitive and grounded in experience, family guidance, and faith, rather than purely logical reasoning.",
            "REI_10": "Carlos frequently reflects on his decisions, such as choosing to work full-time instead of going to college, or considering a career change due to his back pain. He explains his choices in detail during the interview, showing that he often weighs options and considers the long-term implications of his actions."
