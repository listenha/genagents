Based on my experiences, horror movies can be thrilling and engaging, but they are not universally terrifying.

I’ve also found that some horror movies can be overused or clichéd, which can make them less impactful or even boring. Overall, I think horror movies fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum—scary enough to be engaging but not so overwhelming that they cause fear to the point of being 'scared to death.'"

While it is not purely aggressive, it does require a proactive, assertive approach to identifying and supporting innovative businesses. From my perspective, venture capital is more about strategic risk-taking and active engagement rather than passivity. However, it is not as aggressively driven as, say, speculative trading or high-stakes gambling.

While it may evoke some sense of adventure or curiosity, the mention of 'new city' and the imagery of candlelight could also imply a sense of isolation or longing for home.
