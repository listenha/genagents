            "BFI-10_4": "Mikayla has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety and stress, particularly as a working mother and professional. She has mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times and has had to work on her emotional coping strategies. While she has made progress in managing her stress through mindfulness and self-compassion, she still acknowledges the challenges of balancing work, family, and health.

However, she has also shown growth in managing stress through mindfulness, self-compassion, and seeking support from others. While she doesn't always handle stress perfectly, she is actively working on improving her ability to cope, which suggests she would rate herself somewhere in the middle rather than at the extremes.",

While she does not explicitly mention artistic hobbies like painting or music, she does show an appreciation for creativity and storytelling, which are forms of artistic expression.

She also described moments of feeling overwhelmed by her responsibilities, but she has developed coping strategies like mindfulness, therapy, and self-compassion. While she acknowledges her anxiety, she has learned to manage it, which suggests she would not rate herself as extremely nervous.
