  "agent_profile_summary": "Michael Romero, a 40-year-old Italian-American from Hoboken, New Jersey, has built a life rooted in stability, faith, and community. Raised by working-class parents who emphasized education and hard work, he became the first in his family to earn a bachelor’s degree and later chose to leave the comfort of Hoboken for a startup in Chicago at 22, a decision that defined his path toward independence and self-belief. Now living in the same region, he balances a steady career as a business analyst with a deep commitment to his Catholic faith, volunteering at a food pantry, and maintaining close ties with his family. His daily life is marked by routine—attending Mass, journaling, and tending to his balcony garden—reflecting a quiet pursuit of purpose and peace. While he values his independence and has no plans for marriage or children, he remains connected to his roots, navigating the tension between personal freedom and the enduring influence of family and tradition."
