She has also talked about her passion for creative problem-solving and her decision to switch from a technical field to marketing due to her enjoyment of these types of challenges. This indicates that she is more likely to disagree with the statement and find such logical analysis problems manageable or even enjoyable.",
            "REI_3": "Based on Caitlin's responses, she seems to value creativity and personal growth, as evidenced by her interest in volunteer work, personal hobbies like gardening, and her openness to learning new skills.

This suggests that while she acknowledges the existence of stress and anxiety, she has developed strategies to mitigate their negative impacts. Therefore, it seems unlikely that she would rate herself as 5, indicating significant difficulty reasoning under pressure.
