This openness suggests that he is not reserved, and would likely rate himself closer to the higher end of the scale.",

He has also mentioned learning coping strategies such as meditation, journaling, and setting boundaries.

            "REI_9": "Matthew Gorman's story emphasizes emotional resilience, personal connections, and support from others as key factors in overcoming challenges. While he is logical in his work (e.g., managing resources, organizing events), his narrative focuses more on emotional and relational aspects of problem-solving, such as the impact of Ms. Alvarez's support, the importance of community, and his own emotional growth. This suggests he may not rely on logic as the primary method for solving personal life problems.",
            "REI_10": "Matthew Gorman reflects deeply on his life choices, often explaining the reasoning behind his decisions, such as his career path, his work in community outreach, and his personal growth.

He mentions being open with people he trusts, such as his coworkers and friends, and is described as someone who listens and supports others. While he may not be the most outwardly expressive, he is not shy or withdrawn either. He seems to be more introspective and thoughtful, which aligns with a moderate score rather than the extremes of 1 or 5.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Matthew Gorman's interview reveals a person who has experienced hardship, displacement, and uncertainty, yet he has chosen to trust others—like Ms. Alvarez—who helped him during his most vulnerable times.

            "BFI-10_4": "Matthew Gorman discusses his struggles with anxiety and the emotional toll of his work, especially when helping others with their challenges. He also mentions incorporating mindfulness practices, yoga, and journaling to manage stress. While he has made progress, he still acknowledges that stress and anxiety are part of his life, and he is still learning to handle them effectively. This suggests he would not rate himself a 5, but he also wouldn't rate himself a 1, as he actively works on improving his ability to manage stress.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant's interview transcript does not mention any artistic interests or activities. His life story is centered around community service, education, and survival, with no indication of engagement with art, music, or creative hobbies.

He frequently mentions helping people, listening to their struggles, and being grateful for the support he received. His perspective is centered on helping others and understanding their challenges, not on finding fault. This suggests he is more likely to rate himself low on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_8": "The participant describes their work as a community outreach coordinator, where they help others navigate complex systems and provide support. They mention organizing events, running support groups, and ensuring people have access to resources. This suggests a strong attention to detail and a commitment to completing tasks thoroughly. They also reflect on the impact of their work, showing a deep sense of responsibility and care for their clients.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Matthew Gorman has spoken about his struggles with anxiety, particularly in the early years after moving to Cleveland. He described feeling constantly on edge and struggling with the fear of not belonging or failing. While he has made progress in managing his anxiety through therapy, mindfulness, and self-care, he still acknowledges that it is a part of him. This suggests he would likely rate himself somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale, but not at the extreme end (5).",
            "BFI-10_10": "Matthew Gorman's story is rich with reflection, storytelling, and a deep emotional connection to his past and present. He often reflects on his life in vivid detail, imagines future scenarios, and uses metaphors and narratives to describe his experiences.
