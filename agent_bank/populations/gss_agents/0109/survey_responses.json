This openness suggests that he is not reserved, and would likely rate himself closer to the higher end of the scale.",

He has also mentioned learning coping strategies such as meditation, journaling, and setting boundaries.

            "REI_9": "Matthew Gorman's story emphasizes emotional resilience, personal connections, and support from others as key factors in overcoming challenges. While he is logical in his work (e.g., managing resources, organizing events), his narrative focuses more on emotional and relational aspects of problem-solving, such as the impact of Ms. Alvarez's support, the importance of community, and his own emotional growth.

He also mentions that he has had to learn coping strategies such as mindfulness, yoga, and journaling to manage his stress. While he has made progress, he still acknowledges that stress and anxiety are part of his life and that he is still learning to handle them effectively.
