            "BFI-10_1": "Eva has shared her life story openly during the interview, showing vulnerability and emotional honesty. She has discussed her family, struggles, and personal reflections with depth and openness. This suggests she is not reserved but rather expressive and willing to share her experiences.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Eva has shared a life filled with responsibility, family care, and limited personal opportunities. While she has a strong sense of community and relies on people like Mrs. Thompson and Mr. Jenkins, she has also experienced financial strain, health challenges, and the burden of caring for her family. These experiences may have made her cautious, but she also shows trust in those who support her, like her neighbors and family. She does not express deep skepticism about people, but she also does not describe herself as overly trusting.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Eva has consistently demonstrated a strong sense of responsibility and work ethic throughout the interview. She works part-time, helps her family, manages household duties, and is even exploring educational opportunities like online classes and a GED. Her actions and statements reflect a proactive and determined personality, not one that would align with self-perceptions of laziness.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Eva has described feeling stressed and overwhelmed by the responsibilities of caring for her family, managing her health, and financial struggles. She has mentioned feeling stuck, doubting herself, and needing to learn new coping strategies. While she is resilient and responsible, she also expresses feeling tired, stressed, and emotionally burdened, which suggests she does not see herself as someone who handles stress well.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Eva's interview does not mention any engagement with artistic activities, hobbies, or interests related to art, music, or creative expression. She focuses on family, work, and practical responsibilities, with no indication of artistic pursuits. This suggests she would align more with the lower end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Eva describes herself as someone who prioritizes family and has a small, close-knit group of friends and neighbors. While she mentions having a few friends from high school and a neighbor who is like a second mother to her, she also notes that she doesn't have many people in her life outside of her family. She does not describe herself as someone who actively seeks out social interactions or enjoys being in large groups. Her life is centered around her family responsibilities, and she doesn't appear to be particularly focused on expanding her social circle or engaging in social activities outside of her immediate family and a few close relationships.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Eva describes herself as someone who puts her family first, is responsible, and has a strong sense of care and empathy for others. She reflects on her own struggles and the challenges her family has faced, and she expresses gratitude for the support she has received from people like Mrs. Thompson and Mr. Jenkins. She does not express a tendency to find fault with others, but rather emphasizes love, responsibility, and support. Her perspective seems to be more understanding and less critical of others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Eva describes her work as part-time at a store and doing odd jobs, which suggests she is responsible and reliable. She also mentions helping her family with various tasks and taking care of her younger brother’s homework. This indicates she is attentive and takes her responsibilities seriously. However, she does not express a strong sense of pride in her work or describe herself as someone who prioritizes thoroughness above all else. She seems more focused on caregiving and practicality than on perfection or detail-oriented work.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Eva describes feeling stuck, carrying the weight of her family's needs, and experiencing stress and worry about her parents' health and her own future. She also mentions moments of feeling overwhelmed, like when she was juggling multiple responsibilities. While she doesn't explicitly say she gets nervous easily, her emotional state and the challenges she faces suggest she may experience nervousness or anxiety in response to stress.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Eva's life has been defined by practical responsibilities—caring for her family, working part-time, and managing household duties. She reflects on her life with a sense of realism and does not mention engaging in creative or imaginative activities. While she has moments of reflection and dreams about the future, they are grounded in her current responsibilities rather than flights of fancy. Her focus is on survival and stability, not on imagination as a defining trait."

She expresses love and support for her family, friends, and neighbors, and she is clearly attuned to their emotions and struggles. She also mentions feeling grateful for the people in her life and being able to relate to their joys and challenges. This suggests she is capable of understanding and sharing in her friend's happiness.",
            "BES-A_2": "Eva has described having a close-knit community and strong relationships with her family and neighbors, such as Mrs. Thompson and Mr. Jenkins. She also mentions being attentive to her younger brother’s needs and being able to sense when he needs help with school or emotional support. This suggests she has a reasonable level of emotional awareness and empathy. However, she has not mentioned anything about interpreting her friends' emotions, and she has limited social interactions outside of her family and immediate neighborhood. Given her focus on family and limited social circle, it's plausible she might not have much experience or insight into her friends' emotional states.",
            "BES-A_3": "Eva demonstrates a strong ability to empathize with others throughout the interview. She talks about understanding her family's struggles, her own feelings of being stuck, and how she values the support she receives from people like Mrs. Thompson and Mr. Jenkins. She also shows an ability to reflect on her own emotions and the emotions of others, such as when she talks about her brother's future and her parents' health. This suggests she is emotionally attuned and capable of understanding others' feelings.",
            "BES-A_4": "Eva has described herself as someone who prioritizes the needs of her family and often puts others first. She has taken on significant responsibilities, such as caring for her parents and younger brother, and has shown a strong sense of duty and emotional awareness. However, she has also mentioned feeling overwhelmed and struggling with her own emotional health, which may affect her ability to consistently support others in moments of fear or distress. Despite this, her deep care for her family suggests she is generally able to recognize and respond to their emotional needs.",
            "BES-A_5": "Eva demonstrates a strong ability to understand and respond to the emotions of others throughout the interview. She shows deep empathy toward her family, friends, and neighbors, often expressing concern for their well-being and offering support. She also reflects on her own emotional struggles and those of her family, indicating she is in tune with the feelings of those around her.",
            "BES-A_6": "Eva describes herself as someone who is deeply connected to her family and community, showing empathy and emotional awareness in her interactions. She is attentive to the needs of others, as seen in her care for her parents, brother, and neighbors. However, she also reflects on her own emotional struggles and feelings of being overwhelmed at times, which may make it harder for her to always 'work out' when others are cheerful, especially when she is preoccupied with her own responsibilities.",
            "BES-A_7": "Eva describes herself as someone who is deeply connected to her family and community, and she is very aware of the emotional states of those around her. For example, she notices when her mother is struggling with her health, when her brother is under pressure, and when Mrs. Thompson is supportive. She also reflects on her own emotional struggles and those of her family, indicating a strong emotional awareness. This suggests she is likely to be able to recognize when a friend is angry.",
            "BES-A_8": "Eva mentions having a few friends from high school and a neighbor, Mrs. Thompson, who is like a second mother to her. She also reflects on her relationship with her sister and how they stay connected. She shows emotional awareness and care for others, including her family and neighbors. However, she does not explicitly mention being aware of her friends' feelings. Given that she has a small social circle and is focused on family, it is possible she is not very aware of her friends' feelings, but not entirely unaware either.",
            "BES-A_9": "Eva has a close relationship with her younger brother and mentions caring for him, but she does not have a partner or children and has limited mention of friendships beyond a few high school friends and a neighbor. She describes her relationships as supportive but not deeply emotional or interactive. She also mentions that she doesn't use social media much and that she is focused on her family responsibilities. This suggests that while she is caring and connected to her family, she may not be as attuned to the emotional states of her friends, especially given the limited social engagement described."

She has not had the chance to develop these skills in a formal or structured way, and she has expressed feelings of being stuck or unsure about her future. Her response to the question about her financial situation and her lack of formal education suggests she may feel less confident in handling complex problems.",
            "REI_2": "Eva has described her life as one of responsibility, caregiving, and managing practical daily tasks, but she hasn't mentioned engaging in complex problem-solving or logical analysis. Her focus has been on managing her family and household, which involves more practical and emotional decision-making than analytical reasoning. She also mentioned feeling stuck and not having pursued higher education, which may suggest a lack of exposure to or confidence in logical analysis tasks.",
            "REI_3": "Eva's responses throughout the interview suggest she is reflective, thoughtful, and capable of analyzing her life experiences and decisions. She often reflects on her choices, considers different paths, and weighs options carefully, such as when she discussed her decision to stay home after high school. She also shows an ability to evaluate her circumstances and consider future possibilities, such as pursuing a GED or online classes. These traits indicate a more analytical mindset.",
            "REI_4": "Eva demonstrates thoughtful reflection throughout the interview, weighing her options carefully when making decisions, such as choosing to stay home to help her family. She also considers her future, thinks about her health, and reflects on her life experiences with depth. This suggests she does engage in careful reasoning, even if she feels uncertain about her path.",
            "REI_5": "Eva describes her life as one of constant responsibility, caring for her family, managing household duties, and working part-time. She mentions feeling overwhelmed at times, such as when juggling her parents' health, her brother's schoolwork, and her own health issues. She also reflects on moments of doubt and stress, which suggests she may not feel confident in her ability to reason clearly under pressure.",
            "REI_6": "Eva's interview suggests she is more intuitive and emotionally driven in her decision-making, particularly when it comes to family responsibilities and life choices. She often reflects on her decisions in terms of love, duty, and emotional connections rather than logical analysis. She also mentions feeling stuck or unsure about her future, which implies she may not see herself as particularly strong in logical reasoning.",
            "REI_7": "Eva describes herself as someone who has made life decisions based on responsibility, family needs, and emotional considerations rather than formal reasoning or analysis. She reflects on her life with a focus on love, duty, and community, and does not mention engaging in logical problem-solving or decision-making processes. Her narrative is more introspective and emotional, which aligns more with a lower score on the 'logical mind' scale.",
            "REI_8": "Eva often reflects on her life decisions, weighing options and considering the impact on her family. For example, she described carefully considering whether to go to college or stay home to help her family, and she continues to think about her future, even if it's in small steps like taking online classes. This suggests she does engage in thoughtful, deliberate decision-making.",
            "REI_9": "Eva describes her life as being shaped by emotional and familial responsibilities rather than logical planning. She often reflects on her decisions as being driven by love, duty, and the needs of her family, rather than systematic reasoning. She also expresses uncertainty about her future and feels stuck in her current situation, which suggests a lack of confidence in using logic to navigate her life effectively.",
            "REI_10": "Eva often reflects on her decisions, such as choosing to stay home to help her family, and she clearly explains the reasons behind her choices (e.g., responsibility, love, and family). She weighs options, considers the impact on others, and even revisits past decisions with thoughtful analysis. This suggests she has clear, explainable reasons for her decisions."

She has relied on people like Mrs. Thompson, Mr. Jenkins, and her sister for support, and she has expressed gratitude for the people in her life.

She has mentioned feeling stuck and struggling with her back pain, and has only recently started to explore ways to manage her stress, such as talking to Mrs. Thompson, journaling, and trying meditation.

While she shows some awareness of her situation and even considers small steps like online classes or a GED, she does not demonstrate a strong inclination toward logical reasoning as a guiding principle in her life.",
            "REI_8": "Eva demonstrates careful thought in her decisions, such as when she chose to stay home to help her family at 17. She reflects deeply on her choices, considers the impact on her family, and even contemplates future steps like pursuing a GED or online classes. Her responses show a thoughtful and deliberate nature.",
            "REI_9": "Eva often reflects on her life decisions with a sense of emotional weight and responsibility, particularly when it comes to her family. She describes her choices as being made out of love and duty rather than logical analysis. She also expresses uncertainty about her future and seems to rely more on the support of others (like Mrs. Thompson) than on systematic problem-solving. This suggests she may not view logic as the primary tool for navigating her life's challenges.",
            "REI_10": "Eva frequently reflects on her decisions, weighing the impact on her family and her own well-being. She discusses her choice to stay home after high school in detail, explaining her motivations and the factors that influenced her decision.

            "BFI-10_1": "Eva has shared a lot about her life, including personal struggles, family dynamics, and emotional reflections. She has spoken openly about her feelings of being stuck, her health, and her hopes for the future. This suggests she is not overly reserved and is willing to express herself, even when discussing difficult topics.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Eva has shared a life filled with challenges, including financial instability, family responsibilities, and limited opportunities. While she has a strong sense of community and relies on people like Mrs. Thompson and Mr. Jenkins, she also shows signs of being cautious and pragmatic, such as not using social media for emotional support and prioritizing family over personal aspirations. Her experiences suggest she may be more guarded in her trust, leaning toward a lower score.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Eva describes herself as someone who works hard to support her family, takes on multiple responsibilities, and is constantly juggling work, household duties, and caring for her parents and brother. She also expresses a desire to improve her life through education and self-development. These behaviors and attitudes are consistent with someone who does not see themselves as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Eva has described feeling stressed and overwhelmed by her responsibilities, particularly in caring for her family and managing household duties. She has mentioned feeling stuck, tired, and at times doubting herself. While she has started to adopt coping strategies like talking to Mrs. Thompson, journaling, and meditating, she still feels the weight of her responsibilities and has not consistently described herself as relaxed or stress-free. This suggests she would not score very high on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant has not mentioned any artistic interests or activities in the interview. Her life is described as centered around family responsibilities, work, and survival, with no indication of engagement in creative or artistic endeavors. She focuses on practical matters like work, family care, and basic needs, which aligns with a low score on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Eva describes herself as someone who prioritizes family and responsibilities over socializing. While she has a few close friends and a supportive community, she does not engage in social media and does not mention participating in many social events or seeking out new people. Her life is centered around her family, her work, and her neighborhood, which suggests a more introverted or reserved personality.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Eva Garcia's interview reveals a person who is deeply empathetic, focused on caring for her family, and values love and connection. She consistently speaks about her responsibilities to her family, her gratitude for the people in her life, and her efforts to support others. There is no indication that she is prone to finding fault with others. In fact, she often emphasizes understanding, compassion, and the importance of community.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Eva has described her life as one of responsibility and care, particularly in taking care of her family and managing household duties. She consistently shows a strong sense of duty and commitment, even if she feels limited by her circumstances. While she doesn't always have the time or resources to be thorough in every aspect of her life, she has shown a consistent effort to do what she can well, such as managing her family's needs, helping at the store, and even starting to explore educational opportunities. This suggests she sees herself as someone who tries to do her job thoroughly, even if she feels constrained by external factors.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Eva has described a life filled with responsibility, caring for her family, and managing financial and health challenges. While she shows resilience and strength, she also mentions moments of feeling overwhelmed, stuck, and doubting herself. She has expressed stress and worry about her family's well-being and her own future, which suggests she may experience nervousness or anxiety at times. However, she also demonstrates a strong sense of determination and emotional resilience, which may temper her self-perception of being easily nervous.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Eva's interview suggests she is grounded in her responsibilities, focused on her family, and has not engaged in much imaginative or creative thinking beyond her daily life. While she reflects on her past and dreams about her future, these reflections are more about practical life choices and family rather than abstract or imaginative thinking. She does not describe herself as someone who engages in fantasy or creative activities, which aligns more with a lower score on this scale."

She has close relationships with her family and neighbors, such as Mrs. Thompson, and is attuned to their needs and emotions.

            "BES-A_3": "Eva has shown a strong ability to empathize with others throughout the interview. She frequently reflects on her family's struggles, expresses concern for her parents' health, and shows understanding of her brother's pressures.

She is attentive to the needs of her parents, brother, and neighbors, which suggests she is capable of recognizing emotional cues. However, she also mentions feeling overwhelmed at times and not always prioritizing her own emotional awareness. This suggests she may not always be quick to recognize others' anger, but she is generally empathetic.",
            "BES-A_8": "Eva mentions having a few friends from high school and a neighbor, Mrs. Thompson, who is like a second mother to her. She also talks about how her friends and neighbors have been supportive and how she values the connections she has. This suggests she is somewhat aware of others' feelings, though not deeply or consistently. She doesn't appear to be highly empathetic or emotionally attuned to her friends' feelings, but she is not completely unaware either.",
            "BES-A_9": "Eva mentions having a few friends from high school and a neighbor, Mrs. Thompson, who is like a second mother to her. She also notes that she values the people in her life and feels supported by them.
