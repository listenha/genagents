He acknowledges that he still has days when he feels overwhelmed but emphasizes that he has learned to respond to stress with patience and self-awareness. This suggests he is improving in his ability to handle stress, though he may not yet see himself as fully relaxed or stress-free.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Vince Patel describes himself as a software engineer who enjoys problem-solving and math, but there is no mention of any artistic interests or engagement in creative activities.

While he has friends and mentors, and he volunteers at the library, he doesn't describe himself as particularly outgoing or sociable in a broad sense.

He has faced challenges, such as moving to a new country and adjusting to a new culture, but he has consistently shown determination and a focus on personal growth. He also mentions learning to manage stress through routines like walking, yoga, and journaling. While he has experienced moments of feeling overwhelmed or disconnected, he frames these as part of a process and not as defining traits. He does not describe himself as someone who gets nervous easily, but rather as someone who has learned to navigate and manage stress over time.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Vince Patel's interview reflects a person who is reflective, values personal growth, and has a deep appreciation for his roots and the people around him.
