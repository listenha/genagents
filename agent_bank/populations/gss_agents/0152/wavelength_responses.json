For example, my experience with back pain was not random; it was the result of long hours at a desk and poor posture. While there is an element of unpredictability, I believe there are often underlying causes that contribute to things going wrong. Therefore, I place it closer to the middle, leaning slightly toward randomness because of the unpredictable nature of life, but still acknowledging causality."

The candlelight suggests a moment of intimacy, perhaps in a new place, but with a longing for the warmth and familiarity of home. I have often felt this way when I'm in Edison, especially during festivals or when I'm alone in the quiet of my apartment.

These notes were warm, thoughtful, and made me feel connected to my roots. While a note could be cold if it were generic or impersonal, the act of writing by hand typically implies some level of care and emotional investment. Based on my values and experiences, I believe a hand-written note leans more toward the warm and fuzzy end of the spectrum."

Growing up in India, I was exposed to a rich tapestry of aesthetics, from the intricate patterns in traditional clothing to the spiritual significance of festivals. While there are objective elements (like symmetry), my understanding of beauty has always been deeply tied to emotion, memory, and personal connection. For example, the way my grandmother lights a diya during Diwali or the warmth of a family meal feels beautiful to me, not just because of its form, but because of the meaning it carries. That said, I acknowledge that objective standards exist, but they don’t fully capture the depth of what makes something beautiful to an individual."

That said, the imagery of candlelight often brings a sense of intimacy and comfort, which might also hint at a longing for the warmth of home. Given my own experiences of moving to a new country and feeling both excited and nostalgic, I think this clue falls more on the side of wanderlust, as it reflects the experience of being in a new place with a sense of reflection rather than overt longing for home."
