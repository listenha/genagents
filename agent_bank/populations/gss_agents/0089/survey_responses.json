            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Amiyah Nair describes herself as someone who values her relationships and finds support in her community. However, she does not seem to emphasize being the center of attention or being very outgoing.

Although she noted that stress can be a part of her life, particularly during demanding periods at work, she also indicated that she has strategies to cope with it.

She has also described seeking help through therapy and developing coping mechanisms like yoga and mindfulness. While she doesn't seem to be overly anxious in her day-to-day life, she does experience periods of stress and burnout. Therefore, it seems more likely that she would fall closer to the middle of the spectrum rather than choosing the lowest or highest number.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Amiyah seems to value her relationships and connections with others, indicating a more grounded and practical outlook. She does mention hobbies like reading and gardening, which can involve imagination, but it doesn't seem to be a core aspect of her identity or daily life.

She describes her work as demanding but rewarding, indicating that she is capable and competent in solving complex problems.

She also mentions that the final decision to go back to school 'felt natural' and 'seemed like something that was meant to happen.' This suggests a more intuitive approach to decision-making rather than a highly analytical one. Additionally, she emphasizes the support from her parents and mentors, indicating that she values guidance and less rigid, analytical processes.

            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Amiyah describes herself as someone who has pursued a career in software engineering, which involves significant logical reasoning. Her work as a software engineer requires her to solve complex problems through logical analysis, and she mentions that she enjoys staying updated with the latest technologies and contributing to the development of new features. This suggests that she likely falls into the category of someone who is better at logical reasoning than most people.",
            "REI_7": "Given Amiyah's background in software engineering and her work as a software engineer, she would likely value and possess a logical mind. Her profession requires analytical and problem-solving skills, which aligns more closely with option 5.",

            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Amiyah describes how she made a significant decision to go back to school after much contemplation and support from her parents and mentors. She also mentions that the decision 'just happened' in a sense, but it aligns with her values and goals. This suggests she can provide clear explanations for her decisions, even if they aren't always fully conscious choices. Therefore, a score of 4 seems fitting, indicating she usually has clear reasons but occasionally makes decisions that aren't entirely explainable."

While she appreciates the importance of self-care and mindfulness, her responses suggest she is pragmatic and willing to seek advice rather than always relying on her own reasoning.

            "REI_9": "Based on the information provided in the interview, Amiyah seems to have a strong academic background and is currently working as a software engineer. These roles require analytical and logical thinking, suggesting that she likely finds logical reasoning to be effective in solving problems. Additionally, her decision to return to graduate school indicates a commitment to using logical and analytical methods to deepen her knowledge and skills. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that she would lean towards the higher end of the scale.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Amiyah seems to value careful thought and reflection. She mentions that the decision to go back to school 'just happened' in a way that felt natural after exploring her options.
