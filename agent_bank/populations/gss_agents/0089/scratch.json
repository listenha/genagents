  "agent_profile_summary": "Amiyah Nair, a 32-year-old software engineer in San Francisco, grew up in Mumbai before moving to the U.S. at age six, where her parents’ careers in tech and marketing shaped her early understanding of ambition and balance. A defining moment came when she chose to return to graduate school instead of entering the workforce immediately, a decision that expanded her professional horizons and reinforced her belief in the value of education. Now married to John, with whom she shares a deep partnership rooted in mutual support, she balances a demanding tech career with a commitment to mindfulness, yoga, and maintaining close ties with her extended family. Her life is marked by a continuous negotiation between professional growth and personal fulfillment, as she navigates the pressures of her job while planning for a future with children. Her thoughtful approach to life, shaped by her upbringing and experiences, is evident in how she prioritizes connection, self-care, and thoughtful planning in both her work and relationships."
