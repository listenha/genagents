He also mentioned that life tends to take its own course, indicating a more flexible and less analytical approach to decision-making. This aligns more closely with a lower score on this scale.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Thomas Edwards described himself as someone who has managed to maintain a good work-life balance and has coping mechanisms like mindfulness and setting boundaries. He also mentioned that he has been managing his stress levels relatively well and has strategies to handle pressure. Therefore, it is more likely that he would not reason poorly under pressure, ruling out the higher end of the scale.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Thomas describes himself as someone who has chosen a career path in marketing, which doesn't necessarily involve extensive logical reasoning. He also mentions that he finds certain aspects of his job challenging, indicating he might not consider himself exceptionally skilled at logical reasoning. Furthermore, he doesn't mention having a background in fields like engineering, mathematics, or logic puzzles, which would suggest a higher proficiency in logical reasoning. Therefore, it's more likely that Thomas would rate himself lower on this scale.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Thomas Edwards appears to be a professional in a technical field (marketing for a tech company), which often requires logical thinking and analysis. He also mentions that he enjoys staying connected with his community and giving back through volunteering, suggesting he values structured and logical approaches to problem-solving. Furthermore, his focus on professional development and career advancement indicates a tendency towards logical and strategic thinking.",

He values his connections with family and friends and finds fulfillment in his work and community contributions. While he doesn't explicitly mention relying solely on logic, his professional role in marketing and his willingness to contribute to community efforts suggest a thoughtful and analytical mindset. However, his emphasis on social connections indicates that he may not always prefer a purely logical approach to solving problems.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Thomas Edwards reflects on his decision-making process, particularly mentioning that his choice to enter the workforce rather than pursue further education 'just happened' and wasn't a conscious decision-making process. He also notes that he wishes he had more guidance during critical periods. This suggests that he doesn't always have clear, explainable reasons for his decisions. However, he does seem to have a reasonable understanding of his choices and their outcomes, indicating that he is not completely lacking in rational thought. Given this, a score of 3 seems appropriate, but leaning towards the lower end of the scale."
