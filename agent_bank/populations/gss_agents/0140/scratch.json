  "agent_profile_summary": "Ryan Morgan, a 21-year-old from Boulder, Colorado, grew up in an educated, Protestant household where his parents’ careers in education and community support shaped his early understanding of responsibility and service. A pivotal moment in his life came when he chose to take a gap year after high school, traveling across Europe and South America, which deepened his awareness of global interconnectedness and his desire to contribute meaningfully to the world. Now in school, he balances part-time work at a local bookstore with his studies in environmental science, drawn to roles that align with his values of sustainability and community. He maintains a reflective, intentional lifestyle, incorporating morning runs, meditation, and journaling to manage the pressures of uncertainty. His ongoing tension lies in navigating the balance between personal growth and financial stability, while remaining committed to a path that feels authentic and impactful. This journey is reflected in his thoughtful, grounded approach to life and relationships, where he values quiet connection and purpose over conventional success."
