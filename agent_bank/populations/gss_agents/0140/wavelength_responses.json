My experience with math in school and my interest in environmental studies have shown me that math is both a tool for solving real-world problems and a subject that can be deeply nuanced.

While I have a history of traveling and exploring, as seen in my gap year, I also have a deep connection to my home in Boulder and my family. The phrase 'Candle Light at New City' feels like a quiet moment of reflection in a new place, which could lean toward homesickness if the person feels disconnected from their roots. However, it also carries a sense of wonder, which aligns with wanderlust. Given my own experiences of finding balance between exploring and staying connected to home, I would place this clue closer to the middle, leaning slightly toward homesickness due to the reflective and possibly isolating nature of the moment."
