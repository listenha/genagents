            "BFI-10_4": "Ryan has spoken about his struggles with anxiety and burnout, particularly during his gap year and early college days. He has also mentioned that he is still learning to manage stress and has been working on coping strategies like meditation, journaling, and running. While he has made progress, he still describes moments of feeling overwhelmed and having to be intentional about managing his well-being. This suggests he does not see himself as someone who consistently handles stress well, but rather as someone who is still developing these skills.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Ryan Morgan mentions several artistic and creative interests in the interview, including his work at a bookstore, his appreciation for literature, his participation in poetry nights, and his engagement with music and art during his travels. He also reflects on how people like Alex, a local artist, and Sam, who worked with indigenous communities, influenced his perspective. These details suggest that he has a meaningful connection to artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Ryan describes himself as 'quiet' and more into books and music than sports or socializing. He also mentions that he hasn't been focused on relationships and that he's been more independent, especially during his gap year. While he has friends and values connections, he does not seem to be naturally outgoing or sociable. He prefers introspection and small, meaningful interactions over large social events.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Throughout the interview, Ryan Morgan demonstrates a reflective, self-aware, and empathetic nature. He speaks highly of his family, values connection, and shows a deep appreciation for the people and experiences that have shaped him.

However, he also mentions uncertainty and a tendency to feel overwhelmed, which might lead him to not always feel confident in his thoroughness.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Ryan has mentioned experiencing anxiety, particularly during his gap year and early college days, but has since learned to manage it through self-care, therapy, and mindfulness. While he acknowledges past struggles with anxiety, he also emphasizes that he is now more aware of his mental health and has developed strategies to cope. This suggests he would not rate himself as extremely nervous, but also wouldn't rate himself as completely calm.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Ryan Morgan mentions being 'quiet type, more into books and music than sports or socializing,' and that he 'was raised Protestant, but I haven't been religious for a while now.' He also reflects on how his gap year traveling and experiences with people in different cultures 'opened my eyes to so much—how different people live, the struggles they face, and how interconnected we all are.' These details suggest a reflective and imaginative nature. He also talks about how he 'admires' his sister for being 'outgoing' and how he 'got the quiet genes,' which implies a more introspective, imaginative side."

            "BES-A_6": "Ryan Morgan describes himself as reflective, introspective, and values quiet connection. While he is described as thoughtful and grounded, he also mentions that he is more of a private person and prefers real, face-to-face connections over digital ones. He does not explicitly mention being highly attuned to others' emotions, but his ability to engage with people at the bookstore and his appreciation for community suggest some level of social awareness. However, he does not seem to be particularly focused on reading others' emotional states in a detailed or intuitive way.",
            "BES-A_7": "Ryan Morgan describes himself as a reflective, introspective person who values quiet connection and purpose. He is described as the 'quiet type' in his childhood and often reflects on his emotions and those of others through journaling and meditation. While he may not be the most outwardly expressive or socially dominant, he shows a strong awareness of his own emotional state and the importance of meaningful relationships. This suggests he is somewhat attuned to others' emotions, though not necessarily hyper-aware. He is likely to score in the middle range.",
            "BES-A_8": "From the interview, Ryan Morgan describes himself as reflective, intentional, and values quiet connection and purpose. He mentions having close relationships with his family and friends, including people he met during his travels, and emphasizes the importance of meaningful connections. He also reflects on how people in his life, such as his parents, grandparents, and coworkers, have influenced him. This suggests he is generally aware of and responsive to the feelings of others.",
            "BES-A_9": "Ryan Morgan describes himself as introspective, reflective, and values quiet connection and purpose. He mentions having close relationships with family and a few meaningful friends, but he also notes that he hasn't been focused on relationships as much as on his education and personal growth. He is described as quiet and more into books and music than socializing, which suggests he may not be as attuned to social cues or emotional expressions from others. This aligns more with a lower score on this question."
