            "BFI-10_4": "Ryan has spoken about his struggles with anxiety and burnout, particularly during his gap year and early college days. He has also mentioned that he is still learning to manage stress and has been working on coping strategies like meditation, journaling, and running. While he has made progress, he still describes moments of feeling overwhelmed and having to be intentional about managing his well-being. This suggests he does not see himself as someone who consistently handles stress well, but rather as someone who is still developing these skills.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Ryan Morgan mentions several artistic and creative interests in the interview, including his work at a bookstore, his appreciation for literature, his participation in poetry nights, and his engagement with music and art during his travels. He also reflects on how people like Alex, a local artist, and Sam, who worked with indigenous communities, influenced his perspective. These details suggest that he has a meaningful connection to artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Ryan describes himself as 'quiet' and more into books and music than sports or socializing. He also mentions that he hasn't been focused on relationships and that he's been more independent, especially during his gap year. While he has friends and values connections, he does not seem to be naturally outgoing or sociable. He prefers introspection and small, meaningful interactions over large social events.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Throughout the interview, Ryan Morgan demonstrates a reflective, self-aware, and empathetic nature. He speaks highly of his family, values connection, and shows a deep appreciation for the people and experiences that have shaped him.

However, he also mentions uncertainty and a tendency to feel overwhelmed, which might lead him to not always feel confident in his thoroughness.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Ryan has mentioned experiencing anxiety, particularly during his gap year and early college days, but has since learned to manage it through self-care, therapy, and mindfulness. While he acknowledges past struggles with anxiety, he also emphasizes that he is now more aware of his mental health and has developed strategies to cope. This suggests he would not rate himself as extremely nervous, but also wouldn't rate himself as completely calm.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Ryan Morgan mentions being 'quiet type, more into books and music than sports or socializing,' and that he 'was raised Protestant, but I haven't been religious for a while now.' He also reflects on how his gap year traveling and experiences with people in different cultures 'opened my eyes to so much—how different people live, the struggles they face, and how interconnected we all are.' These details suggest a reflective and imaginative nature. He also talks about how he 'admires' his sister for being 'outgoing' and how he 'got the quiet genes,' which implies a more introspective, imaginative side."

            "REI_6": "Ryan Morgan describes himself as more introspective, reflective, and influenced by experiences like travel and personal growth. He emphasizes emotional and spiritual connections, and while he is thoughtful and analytical in certain contexts (like his job at the bookstore or his studies), he doesn't frame his identity around logical reasoning.

This suggests he would not rate himself as significantly better at logical reasoning than most people.",
            "REI_7": "Ryan Morgan describes himself as introspective, reflective, and more connected to personal values, spirituality, and emotional experiences. While he is thoughtful and values learning, his narrative emphasizes connection, creativity, and personal growth over structured logic or analytical reasoning.

            "BFI-10_1": "Ryan describes himself as 'the quiet type' and 'more into books and music than sports or socializing' during his childhood. He also mentions that he's 'not really into politics' and that he's 'still figuring out what I want to do with my life.' These statements suggest that he tends to be introspective and not overly social, aligning more with a reserved personality.

            "BFI-10_9": "Ryan has mentioned experiencing anxiety, particularly during times of transition or uncertainty, such as during his gap year and in the early days of college. He also described periods of emotional exhaustion and burnout, which suggest he is not entirely free from nervousness or anxiety.
