  "agent_profile_summary": "Nancy Anderson, a 42-year-old business consultant from Evanston, Illinois, has built a life rooted in community, connection, and thoughtful decision-making. Raised in a close-knit family where both parents worked full-time—her father as an engineer and her mother as a teacher—she values stability and meaningful relationships. A pivotal moment came after college when she chose to stay in Evanston rather than take a higher-paying job in Chicago, prioritizing community and family over career advancement. Now, she runs her own consulting firm, helping local businesses while maintaining a balanced life with her husband, Mark, and their ongoing journey to start a family. Nancy’s commitment to mindfulness, yoga, and volunteering reflects her ongoing effort to balance professional ambition with personal well-being, all while nurturing the sense of belonging that defines her life in Evanston."
