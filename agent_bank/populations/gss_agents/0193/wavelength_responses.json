Based on my experiences, horror movies can be scary, but they are generally not so extreme that they would cause someone to be 'scared to death.' At the same time, a well-crafted horror movie can be thrilling and engaging, so it's unlikely to be 'bored to death.'

While it may not explicitly express longing for home, it carries a quiet tone that suggests reflection or a moment of pause. Given my own experiences of valuing community and connection, I associate this clue more with a contemplative moment in a new place rather than a strong feeling of wanderlust or homesickness.
