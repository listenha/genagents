While she is involved in her community and works with others at the community center, she also mentions a preference for real, in-person relationships over virtual ones.

This suggests she may not identify strongly with the lowest end of the scale (1), but she also does not seem to experience chronic or severe anxiety that would align with the highest end (5). Her self-awareness and coping strategies indicate a moderate level of nervousness, likely placing her somewhere in the middle of the range.",
