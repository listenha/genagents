While she is involved in her community and works with others at the community center, she also mentions a preference for real, in-person relationships over virtual ones.

While she is reflective and thoughtful, she also engages with others, especially through her work with the community center and her family. She is open about her experiences and emotions, which suggests she is not overly reserved. However, she also mentions valuing quiet moments and reflection, which may indicate a more reserved nature.

            "BFI-10_4": "Angela has described experiencing anxiety and stress in her life, particularly during transitions like leaving the military and balancing work, family, and education.

            "BFI-10_5": "Angela mentions her children participate in art classes, and she has a mindfulness and Buddhist practice that includes meditation and reflection. However, she does not explicitly express any personal artistic interests or engagement with creative activities like painting, music, or writing. Her focus appears to be more on community service, family, and spiritual practice rather than artistic pursuits.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Angela describes herself as someone who values deep, meaningful connections rather than large social circles. She mentions her close relationships with family and a few key friends, but she does not emphasize being outgoing or sociable in a broad sense. She also mentions that she does not use social media much and prefers face-to-face interactions, which suggests she may be more introverted or selectively sociable.",

            "BFI-10_9": "Angela has mentioned experiencing anxiety during her transition from military life to civilian life and has worked to manage it through meditation, therapy, and mindfulness. While she has made progress, she also acknowledges that she still has days when she feels overwhelmed. This suggests she may not identify strongly with the lowest end of the scale (1), but she also does not seem to experience chronic or severe anxiety that would align with the highest end (5). Her self-awareness and coping strategies indicate a moderate level of nervousness, likely placing her somewhere in the middle of the range.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Angela's interview reflects a thoughtful, grounded, and reflective nature. While she is deeply spiritual and engaged in mindfulness, she does not describe herself as someone who frequently engages in imaginative or creative thinking beyond her spiritual practice. She focuses on practical aspects of life, such as managing her household, work, and education, and her narrative emphasizes resilience, presence, and gratitude over fantasy or imagination."
