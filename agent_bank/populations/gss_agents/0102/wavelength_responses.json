In my early education, it was straightforward arithmetic and basic problem-solving, which I found accessible. However, as I've grown and encountered more advanced concepts, I've come to see math as something much deeper—requiring not just memorization, but understanding, intuition, and the ability to think abstractly. My experience with mindfulness and the idea that life is full of layers and depth has made me appreciate the complexity in all things, including math. While I recognize that math can be simplified for basic use, I believe it has a richness and depth that makes it more complex than simplistic."

While there may be some objective elements (like symmetry or color), the feeling of beauty is deeply tied to individual perception and meaning. My own experiences with mindfulness and Buddhism have taught me that beauty is often found in the present moment, in the way things feel to me, rather than in any universal standard. I’ve also seen how different people find beauty in different things—some in nature, others in relationships, art, or even in simple acts of kindness.

This aligns more with the idea that history is not necessarily progressive but shaped by unpredictable forces. However, the eventual rise of mammals and humans could be seen as an improvement, so I place the clue somewhere in the middle."

While it could be interpreted as a moment of calm or beauty in a new setting, the mention of 'New City' suggests a departure from home, which may imply a subtle undercurrent of homesickness.

However, I also recognize that there are objective qualities that contribute to beauty, such as balance or harmony. Given my perspective, I place 'beautifulness' closer to the subjective side, as my experience of beauty is deeply tied to personal meaning and emotional resonance."
