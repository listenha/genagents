Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nJerome Williams: I was born and raised in Philadelphia, right here in the city, on the same block I've lived on since I was a kid. My parents were pretty strict but also very supportive in their own way. My dad had a graduate degree, so he worked in some kind of professional field, but my mom had a bachelor's degree and worked full-time too. It wasn't easy growing up in a low-income household, but they always made sure I had what I needed. I was a pretty good student in high school, but I didn't get into college right away. I ended up taking a few years off to work and save up for school, but life had other plans. I got involved with some friends who weren't the best influence, and I ended up getting in a bit of trouble. That was a wake-up call. I realized I needed to focus on my future, so I went back to school and finished my high school diploma. Now I'm working toward getting my GED and trying to figure out what I want to do next. I'm still figuring out my path, but I know I want to do something that helps people, maybe in education or social work. I just need to get my feet under me first.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nJerome Williams: Yeah, there was definitely a crossroads. I was about 18, right after I finished high school. I had a scholarship to a community college, but I was also working part-time at a local grocery store to help my mom out with bills. One day, I got into an argument with one of my coworkers, and it got pretty heated. I lost my temper and ended up getting suspended from work. That night, I was hanging out with some friends from the neighborhood, and they convinced me to go with them to a party downtown. I didn't think much of it at the time, but I ended up getting caught up in something I shouldn't have been involved in. I was arrested for a minor offense, and that messed everything up. I lost the scholarship, I got grounded by my parents, and I had to drop out of the community college. That moment was the wake-up call I needed. I realized that I was on a path that wasn't leading me anywhere, and I had to make a change. I started going to counseling, I got a job at a local nonprofit that helps kids in my neighborhood, and I began working on my GED. That experience taught me a lot about responsibility, and it's what made me want to help others who are going through similar struggles. I don't want anyone else to make the same mistakes I did.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nJerome Williams: I think it was a mix of both, honestly. I wasn't just waiting for something to happen\u2014I made a conscious decision to change after that night. But it wasn't easy. I had to confront a lot of things about myself, like why I was acting out, why I felt like I had to prove something to my friends. I realized I was scared of not being good enough, of not having a future. That fear was driving a lot of my bad choices. So I made the choice to take responsibility, to stop running from my problems. I didn't have a lot of support at first, but I found a mentor at the nonprofit I started working at, and he really helped me see that I had options. I think the difference was that I finally stopped looking for shortcuts and started working for what I wanted, even if it was hard.\n\n",

When I got in trouble, I didn't really know where to turn. My parents were frustrated with me, and I didn't want to burden them with my mistakes. If there had been a mentor or a program in my high school that could have reached out to me, maybe I wouldn't have felt so lost. I remember one teacher tried to talk to me about my future, but I shut her down because I didn't think I had any. Looking back, I wish I had listened. I think organizations that focus on youth outreach, especially in low-income areas, are really important. They can provide that guidance before kids get into trouble. I want to be that person for someone else now\u2014someone who can show them there's another way, even when it feels like there's no way out.\n\n",

She's in high school, and she's actually really smart\u2014she's already thinking about college. I try to be a good role model for her, even though I know I haven't always made the best choices. My mom and dad are still around, and they've been pretty supportive even after everything that happened. They don't talk about the past much, but I can tell they're proud of me for turning my life around. I still live at home, which helps with the money, but I'm hoping to move out soon once I get my GED and start working full-time. I just want to make sure I don't let my past define me, and that I give my sister a better example than I had growing up.\n\n",

My relationship with my cousins is pretty casual\u2014some of them are pretty cool, others I don't really talk to much.

One of them is Marcus, my coworker at the nonprofit where I started volunteering after I got in trouble. He's been like a brother to me\u2014always pushing me to stay on track, even when I felt like giving up. He's the one who introduced me to my mentor, Mr. Thompson, who's been a huge influence on my life. Mr. Thompson saw something in me that I didn't see in myself, and he helped me realize that I had a purpose. Then there's also my high school teacher, Ms. Rivera, who I mentioned before. After I messed up, she actually reached out to me a few months later, just to check in and see how I was doing. That meant a lot to me, because I didn't expect anyone to still care. I think those people, along with my sister, are the ones who kept me from falling too far. They reminded me that I wasn't alone, and that there was still a chance to rebuild my life.\n\n",

There's a mix of old and new\u2014some of the houses are run-down, but there are also a few newer apartments going up.

I've seen some of my friends get caught up in stuff they didn't ask for, and it's scary knowing that could happen to anyone. But at the same time, there's a sense of community that keeps me grounded. If I'm out walking with my sister or heading to the community center, I feel a lot safer because people look out for each other. It's not perfect, but I think the people here are resilient.

I remember when I was younger, I used to get frustrated with how things were, thinking that the system was against us.

It wasn't easy, but it made all the difference. Now, I try to be more open about how I'm feeling, even if it's just with my sister or Marcus. I've learned that asking for help isn't a weakness\u2014it's part of being strong. I still have days where it's tough, but I know I can get through it, and I'm not alone anymore.\n\n",

There's been a lot of growth, but also a lot of struggle. I've learned to be more honest with myself about the challenges I face, and I've started to accept that healing isn't a straight line. I still have moments where I feel overwhelmed, especially when I'm juggling work, school, and trying to be there for my sister. But I've also learned to celebrate the small wins\u2014the days I show up on time, the times I actually eat a healthy meal, or when I manage to get through a tough conversation with a kid at the nonprofit without losing my cool. I think the biggest shift has been in how I see myself. I used to feel like I was broken or not good enough, but now I see myself as someone who's still learning, still growing, and still trying to do better. I'm not where I want to be yet, but I'm no longer running from who I am. I'm starting to believe that I can build a future that's not just about surviving, but about thriving.\n\n",

But as I got older, I started questioning a lot of things. I didn't feel like the church had answers for the struggles I was going through, especially with my own mistakes and the things I saw in my neighborhood. It felt like the messages I was hearing didn't always match up with the reality of life here. I still respect the values the church teaches, like compassion and forgiveness, but I don't follow any organized religion anymore. I think of it more like a personal journey now\u2014trying to be a better person, even if I don't have a set path or a higher power guiding me.

I used to be on Facebook a little, mostly to keep in touch with cousins and old friends from high school, but it never really felt like it connected me to anything meaningful. I saw too much negativity, arguments, and people posting things just to feel seen or validated.

Rent has stayed pretty much the same, but groceries have been a bit harder to manage, especially during the colder months when I was eating more at home and trying to keep warm without turning the heat up too much. I also noticed that transportation costs went up a little when the bus fare increased, which hit me pretty hard because I rely on the bus to get to work and classes. Then there were the holidays\u2014around Christmas, I had to spend a bit more on gifts for my sister and some small things for the kids at the nonprofit, which I hadn't really budgeted for.

I used to think that being strong meant hiding my pain, but now I know that being strong is about being honest with yourself and others. I'm still learning, but I'm no longer afraid to ask for help. I want to be the kind of person who can support others the way I've been supported, and I hope that by sharing my story, I can help someone else feel less alone in their own journey. Financially, I know it's tight, but I'm learning to be more responsible with what I have and to prioritize what really matters. I'm not where I want to be yet, but I'm proud of the progress I've made and the person I'm becoming.",

That's mostly from my part-time job at the nonprofit, plus what my parents contribute. It's not a lot, but it covers the basics\u2014rent, groceries, transportation, and my GED classes. I know it's not enough to save for the future or even to have much extra, but I'm trying to be responsible with what we have. I've learned that money isn't everything, but it does help when you're trying to build something better. I just hope that one day, I can earn more and give my sister the opportunities I didn't have. Until then, I'm just focused on making sure we don't fall behind and that I keep moving forward, even if it's one step at a time.\n\n",

The benefits aren't the typical ones you see in bigger companies\u2014no health insurance or paid vacation days\u2014but what they do offer is something more valuable. They give me purpose, a sense of belonging, and the chance to make a real difference in someone else's life. The biggest benefit, I think, is the support system. The people here, from the directors to the other volunteers, they're like family. They don't just see me as an employee\u2014they see me as someone who's trying to grow, who's trying to do better. And that makes all the difference. I know I'm not making a lot of money, but I feel like I'm investing in something bigger than myself. I'm investing in the kids who come through here, in the community, and in the person I want to become.\n\n",

He's the one who really saw something in me when I was at my lowest, and he didn't give up on me. He's always pushing me to be better, but he also knows when to give me space. He's strict when he needs to be, but he's fair and he cares. And the coworkers\u2014Marcus is definitely my brother, but there are others too, like Lisa and Carlos, who've been there for me when I needed support. We all have our own struggles, but we lift each other up. It's not just about the work we do; it's about the trust we've built with each other. I feel like I can be myself here, without judgment, and that's something I didn't think I'd ever find in a workplace. It's not perfect, but it's real, and that's what makes it special.\n\n",

I usually start at 9 a.m. and finish at 3 p.m., but sometimes I'll stay a little later if there's an event or if I need to catch up on paperwork. The nice thing is, I don't have to be in the office at a specific time every day\u2014most of the time, I can plan my day around my classes and family responsibilities.

It wasn't the biggest hospital in the city, but it was a place where people really cared. She was part of the support team, so she didn't have the same responsibilities as the doctors or nurses, but she was still essential. She made sure patients were comfortable, helped them with meals, and sometimes just sat with them when they were feeling alone. I remember seeing her come home with her uniform still on, her feet swollen from standing all day, and her voice always tired but steady. My dad worked for a consulting firm, one of those places where people wore suits and spent most of their time in meetings or hunched over computers. He was good at his job, but he never really talked about it much. I think he was one of those people who preferred to keep his work separate from his home life.
