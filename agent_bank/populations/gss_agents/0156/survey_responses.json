He has shared extensively during the interview, showing a willingness to be vulnerable and express his emotions. This suggests he is not reserved in the sense of being quiet or private.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Jerome has shared experiences of being let down by friends and peers in the past, which may have made him more cautious. However, he also emphasizes the importance of support systems, such as his mentor, coworkers, and family, which suggests he does trust people who have been there for him. His openness about his struggles and willingness to accept help indicates a moderate level of trust, not extreme skepticism or unwavering optimism.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Jerome has demonstrated a strong sense of responsibility, self-awareness, and motivation throughout the interview. He has taken active steps to improve his life, such as working part-time at a nonprofit, pursuing his GED, and being a supportive figure for his sister. He reflects on his past mistakes and has made conscious efforts to change his behavior, showing a clear drive to better himself. These traits are inconsistent with seeing himself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Jerome has openly discussed his struggles with anxiety and depression, and how he has been learning to manage stress through support systems, therapy, and self-care. While he has made progress, he still describes having days where he feels overwhelmed and stressed, indicating he does not yet see himself as someone who handles stress well. However, he is actively working on improving his coping strategies, which suggests he is somewhere in the middle of the range.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant's interview does not mention any engagement with artistic activities or interests. His focus is on community service, education, and personal growth, with no indication of involvement in creative or artistic pursuits. He does not describe hobbies, passions, or interests related to art, music, or other creative fields.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Jerome describes himself as someone who has built meaningful relationships with people in his life, such as his sister, coworkers, and mentors. He is actively involved in his community and works at a nonprofit where he interacts with children and other volunteers. However, he also mentions that he is focused on his personal growth and responsibilities, and he does not use social media much, which suggests he may not be overly focused on socializing for its own sake. He seems more introspective and deliberate in his interactions, which aligns more with a middle range rather than the highest level of outgoingness.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Jerome demonstrates a strong sense of self-awareness, empathy, and a desire to support others, especially those in his community. He reflects on his own past mistakes and emphasizes the importance of helping others avoid similar pitfalls.

These traits suggest he is more likely to be forgiving and less inclined to find fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Jerome has shown a strong commitment to his work at the nonprofit, where he helps kids in his community. He reflects on his role with a sense of purpose and responsibility, and he has made conscious efforts to improve his life and support others. He also mentions learning from his mistakes and being more intentional in his actions, which suggests he values thoroughness. However, he also acknowledges that he is still learning and growing, which may temper his confidence in his ability to be consistently thorough.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Jerome has openly discussed his struggles with anxiety and depression, describing moments where he felt overwhelmed, anxious, and even contemplated quitting his job or giving up on his goals. He also mentioned having generalized anxiety disorder and mild depression, which suggests he experiences nervousness or anxiety regularly. While he has made progress in managing these feelings, the interview indicates that nervousness is still a part of his life, especially during challenging times.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Jerome reflects on his life with a focus on real-world challenges, responsibilities, and personal growth. While he does show some introspection and self-awareness, his narrative is grounded in practical experiences, such as his job at the nonprofit, his GED studies, and his efforts to support his family. There is little indication that he engages in imaginative or creative thinking as a defining trait. His self-perception is more about resilience and responsibility than creativity or imagination."

He often emphasizes the importance of relationships, support systems, and emotional resilience over strict logic or structured problem-solving. He also describes his journey as one of learning and emotional coping rather than purely logical decision-making. This suggests he may not rely heavily on logic alone to navigate life's challenges.",
            "REI_10": "Jerome reflects deeply on his decisions throughout the interview, often explaining the reasoning behind his choices, such as his decision to change his life after getting in trouble, his choice to work at the nonprofit, and his commitment to helping others.

            "BFI-10_1": "Jerome describes himself as someone who has been through a lot, including personal struggles and moments of self-doubt. While he is open about his past and his current efforts to improve, he also shows a level of introspection and caution in how he shares his experiences. He is thoughtful and deliberate in his actions, often reflecting on his choices and the impact he has on others. This suggests he may not see himself as very outgoing or expressive, aligning more with a reserved self-perception.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Jerome has shared a life marked by personal struggles, including involvement with friends who led him into trouble, and he has had to rebuild his life from those experiences. While he has found support from people like his sister, Marcus, and Mr. Thompson, he also seems to have developed a cautious view of others, particularly given his past. He has not expressed a general tendency to trust others without question, and his journey has been one of learning and growth rather than blind optimism.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Jerome has shown a clear commitment to improving his life, taking responsibility for his past mistakes, and working hard toward his goals, such as completing his GED and helping others in his community. He has described making conscious decisions to change his behavior and has taken consistent steps to build a better future. These actions indicate a strong sense of discipline and motivation, which are contrary to the traits associated with laziness.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Jerome has openly discussed his struggles with anxiety and depression, and has described moments where he felt overwhelmed by work, school, and personal responsibilities. While he has made progress in managing his mental health, he still acknowledges days when stress feels too heavy. He has not described himself as consistently relaxed or stress-free, which suggests he would not rate himself as a 5. However, he has also shown growth in coping strategies and has learned to ask for help, which indicates some level of stress management. This points to a middle ground rather than the lowest end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Throughout the interview, Jerome discusses his life, work, and goals in a very practical and community-focused way. He talks about his job at the nonprofit, his GED, his family, and his neighborhood, but there is no mention of any artistic interests, hobbies, or creative pursuits. He does not reference music, art, writing, or any other artistic activities. His focus is on personal growth, helping others, and stability, which aligns more with someone who sees themselves as having few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Jerome describes himself as someone who is actively involved in his community, works at a nonprofit where he interacts with kids and volunteers, and has strong relationships with his sister, coworkers, and mentors. He is described as being supportive, engaged, and willing to help others, which suggests a sociable and outgoing nature. However, he also reflects on past struggles with anxiety and self-doubt, which may have made him more reserved at times. Still, his current role and the people he interacts with regularly indicate a more outgoing disposition.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Jerome reflects on his past mistakes and emphasizes personal growth, empathy, and the importance of support from others. He often speaks about being there for others, especially young people in his community, and shows a strong sense of self-awareness and humility. He does not exhibit tendencies to find fault in others, instead focusing on his own development and helping others. His narrative is centered on understanding and supporting others, not judging them.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Jerome has shown a commitment to his responsibilities, such as working at the nonprofit, attending GED classes, and being present for his sister. He also reflects on his progress and is aware of the effort it takes to make changes in his life. While he acknowledges his past struggles, he is focused on doing better and being there for others. This suggests he values thoroughness in his actions, even if he is still learning to be consistent.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Jerome has openly discussed his struggles with anxiety and depression, including moments where he felt overwhelmed by work, school, and personal responsibilities. He described feeling anxious and stressed, especially during times when he was juggling multiple responsibilities. However, he has also made progress in managing his mental health through therapy, support from others, and self-care routines. This suggests he is not at the extreme end of the scale (5), but he is also not entirely free from nervousness. Given his self-awareness and the context of his struggles, he is likely to rate himself somewhere in the middle.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Jerome's life story shows that he is reflective, goal-oriented, and focused on practical steps to improve his life. While he does show some introspection and creativity in his thinking (e.g., planning for his future, reflecting on his past), there is no explicit mention of imagination, fantasy, or creative thinking as a defining trait. His narrative is more grounded in real-life challenges, responsibilities, and personal growth rather than imaginative or abstract thinking."

He has shown self-awareness, problem-solving skills, and the ability to make thoughtful decisions about his future.

He emphasizes his journey of self-awareness, his focus on relationships, and his role as a mentor, which suggests a more intuitive and emotionally driven approach to decision-making rather than a highly analytical one.

He reflects on his choices, evaluates his progress, and sets structured plans for his future. While he is not overly focused on abstract logic or analytical thinking, he shows a clear ability to plan, reflect, and make decisions based on his experiences and goals.

            "REI_9": "Jerome reflects on his life with a focus on personal growth, self-awareness, and emotional resilience. While he shows a strong ability to reflect on his actions and make conscious decisions, his narrative emphasizes emotional and relational factors (like support from family and mentors) as key to his transformation.
