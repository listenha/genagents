Some are more about suspense and psychological tension, while others are more graphic or intense. Based on my personal experiences, horror movies can be very effective at creating fear, especially when they are well-made and immersive. That said, I also know that some horror movies can be predictable or over-the-top, which might make them less scary and more boring to some people. Overall, I think horror movies are more likely to be on the 'scared to death' side of the spectrum, but not necessarily at the extreme end."
