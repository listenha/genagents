  "agent_profile_summary": "Jerome Williams, 22, grew up in Philadelphia in a working-class household where both parents held steady jobs, instilling in him a sense of responsibility despite the financial challenges they faced. After a troubled period in his late teens that led to a minor arrest and the loss of a scholarship, Jerome made a conscious decision to turn his life around, choosing to return to school, secure a GED, and work at a local nonprofit called Youth Forward, where he mentors and supports at-risk youth in his neighborhood. This commitment has become a cornerstone of his life, reflecting his deep desire to help others avoid the mistakes he once made. While he navigates the ongoing tension between his limited financial resources and his aspirations for a stable future, Jerome’s growth is marked by his increasing self-awareness, his effort to build healthier habits, and his determination to be a positive role model for his younger sister. His journey is one of resilience, shaped by a belief in redemption and the power of community support."
