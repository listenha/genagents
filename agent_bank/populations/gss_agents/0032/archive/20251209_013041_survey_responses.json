            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Juan describes himself as someone who has made conscious choices and values personal development and self-care. He mentions that he dedicates time to personal development, such as meditation and physical activity, which suggests a level of introspection and a focus on inner growth. While he does mention that he is a bit reserved in his daily life, his emphasis on personal well-being and the support systems he has in place indicate that he is not extremely reserved to the point of being uncomfortable in social situations. Therefore, it is more likely that Juan would choose a number closer to the middle of the range.",

Additionally, his work involves engaging with different stakeholders and collaborating on projects, which suggests he trusts others to contribute positively.

He describes setting boundaries and using mindfulness practices to manage his stress, but notes that it can still be a challenge.
