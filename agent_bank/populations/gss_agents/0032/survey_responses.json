            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Juan describes himself as someone who values personal development, enjoys spending time with friends, and dedicates time to personal hobbies and volunteering. While he does mention some introverted traits, such as needing breaks during the day and valuing mindfulness and meditation, his overall narrative suggests a more balanced and social personality. He also mentions having close friendships and participating in community events, which indicates he is not extremely reserved. Therefore, a middle ground seems more fitting.",

He mentions the importance of trust in his relationships with family, friends, and colleagues. Additionally, his involvement in volunteering and community activities suggests a generally positive outlook on others.

He mentions using mindfulness practices, physical activity, and support systems like friends and therapists to cope with stress. This indicates that he is relatively relaxed and manages stress well compared to someone who would choose 1. However, he does acknowledge experiencing stress and anxiety during the pandemic, suggesting that he is not perfectly stress-free. Therefore, a middle range score seems appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Juan Ramirez does not mention any artistic interests, nor does he discuss enjoying or participating in any form of art. He describes himself as someone who values education and personal development through activities like exercise, reading, and volunteering.

He mentions attending cultural events and engaging in activities with friends, indicating a social life. However, he also talks about needing time to himself and maintaining a balance between work and personal life. This suggests he is not extremely outgoing all the time, but he does value social interactions. Given this, a score of 4 seems most fitting, but since the scale is 1 to 5, 3 would be a reasonable choice as it indicates a moderate level of sociability without being the most extreme.",

He has spoken about the importance of family, community, and support systems in his life. This suggests he is more likely to be understanding and less critical of others.

His commitment to personal development and his work in a government affairs department suggest that he is someone who pays attention to details and strives for thoroughness in his work.

Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that Juan would choose a higher number on the scale.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Juan talks about experiencing stress and anxiety, especially during the pandemic. He mentions managing these feelings with support from friends and therapists, and using mindfulness practices and physical activity. However, he does not describe himself as someone who is constantly nervous or anxious. Therefore, it seems more likely that he would choose a lower number, indicating that he does not get nervous easily, but acknowledges that he does experience some anxiety.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Juan Ramirez seems to be a pragmatic and grounded individual who values education, hard work, and practical solutions. While he appreciates the value of creativity and innovation in his professional work, the interview does not suggest that he spends much time on purely imaginative pursuits.

However, he also mentions that he sometimes needs help and support from organizations and individuals, indicating he might not always reason things out carefully. Additionally, he describes himself as slightly liberal and independent, which suggests he might lean towards making decisions based on values and beliefs rather than extensive analysis. Given these factors, it's likely that Juan would fall somewhere in the middle of the scale, but closer to the lower end.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Juan Ramirez seems to be a thoughtful and resilient individual who has managed to navigate various challenges, including the uncertainties of the pandemic and the demands of his job.

This suggests that he is capable of handling pressure to some extent. However, the statement 'I don't reason well under pressure' implies a more significant struggle, which might be true given the high cost of living and the demands of his job.
