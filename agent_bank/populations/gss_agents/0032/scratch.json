  "agent_profile_summary": "Juan Ramirez, a 35-year-old U.S. citizen of Guatemalan heritage, grew up in San Diego, where his parents, both working-class immigrants, instilled in him the value of education and perseverance. After choosing to attend San Diego State University over a trade school, he pursued a degree in political science, a decision that shaped his career in government affairs and his commitment to advocacy. Now working full-time in policy development, he balances a demanding schedule with community involvement, volunteering at a local non-profit that supports underprivileged youth. His life is guided by a desire to build a stable future, both financially and personally, while giving back to the community that helped him rise. Raised Catholic, he remains grounded in his faith and values, navigating the pressures of work and life with mindfulness and a strong support network of family and friends."
