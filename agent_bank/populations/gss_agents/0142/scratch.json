  "agent_profile_summary": "Adrian Santos, a 27-year-old software developer living in Boston, grew up in the Philippines before moving to New England at age five, where he was raised by highly educated parents who emphasized the value of education and hard work. A pivotal moment came during his junior year of high school when he secured an internship at a local tech company, sparking his interest in computer science and leading him to pursue a degree in the field. Now working full-time in software development, Adrian balances his career with a deep commitment to family, regularly visiting his parents and grandmother, who remains a source of wisdom and support. He also stays active in his church community, where he finds spiritual guidance and a sense of belonging. Adrian’s life is shaped by a steady focus on growth, whether through professional development, personal health, or maintaining the close-knit relationships that have always grounded him. His decisions reflect a thoughtful balance between ambition and the values instilled in him from a young age."
