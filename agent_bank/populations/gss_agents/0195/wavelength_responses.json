My own experiences with drinking are limited, but I tend to view it as something that can be enjoyable and socially bonding when done in moderation and with the right company.

While it is not particularly 'zesty' in the traditional sense (like citrus or spice), it does have a distinct flavor profile that sets it apart from blandness.

I have received notes from family members, friends, and even students that were filled with love, gratitude, or encouragement. These notes were warm and meaningful. While a note could be cold or utilitarian, the act of writing by hand usually implies some level of care and thoughtfulness. Based on my values and experiences, I believe a hand-written note is more likely to be warm and fuzzy than cold and jagged."
