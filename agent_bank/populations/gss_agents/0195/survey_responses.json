These behaviors align with someone who handles stress well and is more relaxed.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Lauren mentions her faith, community work, and personal routines, but there is no indication that she engages in artistic activities or expresses interest in them.

She mentions having a few close friends, being involved in her church community, and having a quiet, intentional lifestyle.

            "BFI-10_9": "Lauren has spoken about experiencing anxiety during busy periods in her career and when juggling multiple responsibilities. However, she also emphasizes that she has learned to manage this anxiety through prayer, journaling, and support from her community. She does not describe herself as someone who gets nervous easily, but rather someone who has developed coping strategies to handle stress. This suggests she would rate herself lower on the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Lauren describes herself as someone who values structure, community, and purpose. While she reflects deeply on her life and values, her narrative is grounded in real-life experiences, responsibilities, and practical decisions.
