He mentioned that while he can feel stressed or overwhelmed at times, he has developed coping mechanisms and support systems (like family yoga sessions and open communication) to manage his emotions.

He describes himself as slightly liberal politically and works as a project manager, which requires some problem-solving skills. However, he does not seem overly confident in his abilities to solve highly complex problems. Given his background in construction and project management, he likely faces challenges that require some problem-solving, but he doesn't appear to struggle with them constantly. Therefore, a score of 3 or 4 might be more fitting, but considering the slight uncertainty expressed, a 3 seems more appropriate.",

While he values education and has made strategic decisions for his future, there's no specific indication that he excels in logical analysis or problem-solving.

He manages his work and family life, showing a degree of resilience and problem-solving skills.

            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Tyrell Jenkins describes himself as a project manager who values communication and coordination with various stakeholders. While he does not explicitly mention being a highly logical thinker, his job requires him to solve problems and make decisions based on data and information.
