Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMelissa O'Connell: I was born and raised in Chicago, in a working-class neighborhood on the South Side. My parents were both from Ireland, and they worked hard to make ends meet. My father was a mechanic, and my mother worked part-time at a local grocery store. We didn't have a lot of money growing up, but we had a lot of love and support. I was a pretty quiet kid, always reading books or getting lost in my thoughts. I remember my mother used to take me to Mass every Sunday, even though I wasn't really into it by the time I was a teenager. I was more interested in politics and social issues, which probably explains why I ended up leaning so far left. I went to college on a scholarship, studied political science, and eventually got my master's degree. After college, I worked my way up in local government, focusing on community development and social justice. I met my husband, James, while volunteering at a community center. We got married a few years ago, and we've been trying to build a life that's both stable and meaningful. I still feel a strong connection to my roots, even though I've grown a lot as a person over the years.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMelissa O'Connell: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped my path. I was 19, just starting my second year of college, and I had the option to take a summer job at a corporate firm that offered good pay and clear career advancement. My parents were thrilled\u2014the money would have helped us out a lot, and I could have been on a more traditional path. But I also had the chance to work with a local nonprofit that focused on housing for low-income families. I remember sitting in my dorm room, staring at the two job offers, and feeling torn. On one hand, the corporate job was stable and prestigious. On the other, the nonprofit work felt more aligned with who I was and what I believed in. In the end, I chose the nonprofit. It was tough, especially financially, but that summer changed everything for me. I saw firsthand the struggles people faced, and it solidified my commitment to social justice. That decision led me to work in local government, and eventually to the life I have now. I don't think I would be the same person if I had taken the other path.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nMelissa O'Connell: I think I made a conscious choice, but it wasn't something I realized at the time. I was so conflicted, but deep down, I knew that if I took the corporate job, I would always wonder if I had sold out my values for comfort. I remember talking to my mother that night, and she said something that stuck with me: 'You can always find a job, but you can't always find a purpose.' That really resonated with me. I didn't have a lot of money growing up, and I saw how hard my parents worked just to give me a shot. I didn't want to be someone who just climbed the ladder for the sake of it\u2014I wanted to climb it to make a difference. So, even though it was scary, I chose the path that felt right, even if it wasn't the easiest one.\n\n",

When I was making that decision, I was pretty much on my own, but looking back, I realize how much support I had from people I didn't even think about at the time. My professor in my political science class, for example, had worked in community organizing before he became a teacher. He had a way of asking questions that made you think about the bigger picture. He didn't push me to take the corporate job\u2014he just asked me, 'What kind of world do you want to live in?' That question stayed with me. And then there was the director of the nonprofit, who took a chance on me even though I didn't have much experience. She saw something in me, and she gave me a chance to grow. I think those people, and even the struggles I faced, were the helping hands I needed. Without them, I might not have had the courage to follow my own path.\n\n",

We've been married for about five years now, and he's been a huge support in everything I do. He works as a teacher in the public school system, which I think is another reflection of our shared values. We both believe in education as a tool for empowerment, and we try to live that out in our daily lives. We don't have any children yet, but we're talking about starting a family in the next few years. It's something we're both excited about, though we're also being practical about it\u2014raising a child is a big commitment, and we want to make sure we're in a good place financially and emotionally before taking that step. My parents are still in Chicago, and they're very proud of me, even though they sometimes worry about the risks I take in my work. I make sure to visit them as much as I can, and we still have that strong connection to our roots. Family has always been important to me, even if my path hasn't been the traditional one.\n\n",

It's amazing how the choices we make, even the difficult ones, can lead us to a life that feels meaningful.

She's five years younger than me, and we've always had a complicated relationship. We grew up close, but as we got older, our paths diverged a lot. She didn't share my interest in politics or social issues\u2014she was more into art and music. She moved to New Orleans after college and became a graphic designer.

One person who comes to mind is Rachel, a former coworker from the community development office where I started my career. She was like a sister to me, someone who always had my back, even when I doubted myself. We used to spend hours talking about everything from policy changes to our personal struggles. She taught me the importance of resilience and how to stand up for what I believe in, even when it's not popular. She left the city a few years ago to take a job in another state, but we still keep in touch. I miss her presence, but I'm grateful for the lessons she gave me. Then there's my best friend, Lena, who I met in college. We've been through so much together\u2014late-night study sessions, political debates, and even some pretty rough patches in our lives. She's the one who always reminds me to laugh, even when things get serious. Without people like Rachel and Lena, I don't think I'd have the strength or the perspective I have today.\n\n",

It's a mix of old and new\u2014there are a lot of young professionals moving in, but also long-time residents who have deep roots in the community.

On the positive side, I love the energy of the neighborhood\u2014the way it feels like a place where people are still trying to make things better, even when the odds are against them. There's a lot of diversity here, and I've met so many interesting people through community events and local organizations. I also appreciate the walkability\u2014being able to grab a coffee, go to the library, or meet up with friends without needing a car. But there are definitely challenges. The cost of living has gone up a lot in the past few years, and I know that some of my neighbors are struggling to keep up with rent and bills. I've seen long-time residents move out because they can't afford to stay, and that's something that weighs on me.

I work full time in local government, so my days are pretty structured\u2014meetings, policy reviews, and community outreach.

About a year ago, I started experiencing some persistent back pain, which I initially dismissed as just stress or poor posture from sitting at my desk for long hours. But it got worse, and I finally went to see a doctor. Turns out, I had a herniated disc in my lower back. It was a bit of a wake-up call. I had to take a few weeks off work to recover, which was tough because I'm used to being productive all the time. I started seeing a physical therapist, and I've been doing a lot of stretching and strengthening exercises since then. It's been a slow process, but I'm feeling much better now. Along with that, I also had a flare-up of my seasonal allergies last spring, which was pretty intense. I had to take more antihistamines than usual and even missed a few days of work because I was so congested and tired.

How about you?\n\nMelissa O'Connell: Honestly, the health issues I've faced over the past year have definitely affected my work, at least in some ways. The back pain forced me to take a break from my usual routine, which was hard because I'm used to being constantly engaged in my job. I had to delegate some tasks and rely more on my team, which was a good reminder that I can't do everything on my own. It also made me rethink how I set up my workspace and how I move throughout the day. As for caring for children, I can't say for sure how it would have played out, but I know that if we ever have kids, I'll need to be even more intentional about balancing work, health, and family. I've seen so many people struggle with burnout or neglecting their health because they're trying to juggle everything, and I don't want that to be my story. These experiences have made me more aware of the importance of self-care and setting boundaries\u2014not just for myself, but for anyone who might be in a similar position.\n\n",

On one hand, I've been really proud of the work I've been doing in my job\u2014helping to push for more affordable housing initiatives and supporting small businesses in the neighborhood. It's been rewarding to see some of the policies we've worked on actually take shape, like the new community garden project on the corner of Clark and Addison. That kind of progress gives me hope that we can make a real difference, even in small ways. But there have also been moments of frustration and exhaustion. The political landscape has been so polarized, and sometimes it feels like we're fighting an uphill battle just to get basic needs met for people in our community. I've also been dealing with the ongoing back pain, which has made me more aware of how much I take my body for granted. I've been trying to be more intentional about rest and self-care, which has been a learning process. At the same time, I've been really grateful for the support from James and the people around me. Even on the hardest days, knowing that I'm not alone has made all the difference. It's been a year of challenges, but also of growth, and I think I'm coming out of it with a stronger sense of who I am and what I stand for.\n\n",

How about for you?\n\nMelissa O'Connell: I think I've struggled with anxiety in the past, especially during times when I felt like I wasn't making enough progress or when the weight of the work felt too heavy to carry alone. There were moments when I questioned whether what I was doing really mattered, or if I was just chasing an ideal that was too far out of reach. But I've learned that anxiety isn't always a bad thing\u2014it can be a sign that I care deeply about something, that I'm pushing myself to do better. I've been working with a therapist to explore some of these feelings, and it's helped me understand that it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. I've also found that talking to James, or even just writing in my journal, helps me process things without getting stuck in a cycle of worry. I don't think I've ever been diagnosed with clinical depression, but I know that mental health is something I have to stay aware of, especially in a job that can be so emotionally and politically taxing.

He's been incredibly patient, and he's even started helping me with some of the lighter tasks at home so I can focus on recovery. My parents, on the other hand, have been worried about me, especially since they remember what it was like growing up in a working-class household where health issues could really disrupt your life. They've been calling more often, checking in on me, and reminding me that it's okay to take things slow. My sister Claire, though, has been more focused on her own life in New Orleans, but she's still been there for me in her own way\u2014sending me messages about her latest art projects or just reminding me to take a break and not push myself too hard.

Growing up, I was raised Catholic, like most of my family, and I went to Mass every Sunday with my mother. But as I got older, I started to question a lot of the teachings and the way the Church handled certain issues\u2014especially around social justice and the treatment of marginalized communities. I remember being really frustrated in high school when the Church took a stance on issues that didn't align with what I believed in, like LGBTQ+ rights or economic inequality. Over time, I drifted away from organized religion, and now I'd say I'm more spiritual than religious. I still believe in something bigger than myself, and I find meaning in the connections I have with other people, the work I do in my community, and the small moments of kindness that make life worth living. I don't need a church to feel that sense of purpose\u2014it's in the everyday actions and relationships that shape who I am.\n\n",

I follow a few local activists, nonprofit organizations, and even some national movements that align with my values. Instagram, in particular, has been a good platform for seeing the impact of community projects\u2014like the new community garden we helped get off the ground. I also use Facebook to keep in touch with old friends, my family, and some of the neighborhood groups I'm involved with. It's a way to share updates about events, volunteer opportunities, or just to let people know I'm thinking about them. That said, I'm pretty selective about what I engage with online.

There were times when I felt like I was carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders, especially when we faced pushback on some of the housing initiatives we were trying to get passed. But I've been working on developing better coping strategies. One of the biggest changes has been incorporating more mindfulness into my daily life\u2014whether it's through meditation, journaling, or even just taking a few deep breaths when I feel overwhelmed. I've also started setting clearer boundaries between work and personal time, which has helped me feel more in control. I've learned that it's okay to take a step back and not be productive all the time.

I live in a two-bedroom apartment on the North Side, and the rent is around $1,800 a month. It's not cheap, but I was lucky to find a place that's close to work and has a good sense of community. Groceries came to about $600, which includes not just food for me and James, but also some meal prep for the weekend and a few snacks for work. I try to be mindful of where I spend, especially with the rising cost of living. Transportation is another big one\u2014since I work downtown, I use the CTA train most days, which costs around $120 a month. I also have a car, but I only use it on weekends or for errands, so the gas and maintenance are manageable. I also set aside money for utilities, insurance, and a small emergency fund. It's not always easy balancing everything, but I've learned to prioritize what's most important and make sacrifices where I can.

We also have monthly expenses for utilities, which run about $200, and insurance, which is another $300.

For example, during the winter months, my utility bills went up because of heating costs, and I had to be more careful with my budget to make sure I wasn't overspending. Then, in the spring, I had that flare-up with my allergies, which meant more medication and a few days of missed work where I had to take time off to recover. That added a bit of strain on the budget, especially since I had to cover some of the lost income. On the other hand, holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas brought in some extra expenses\u2014like gifts for family, a nice dinner out, and a few new books I bought for my personal development. I also had to replace my old laptop last summer, which was a bigger one-time expense, but it was necessary for my work. Overall, I've been trying to track my spending more closely and adjust as needed, whether that means cutting back on non-essentials or setting aside a little more each month for unexpected costs.

I've always focused on one role, especially since my work in local government requires a lot of dedication and collaboration. I remember when I first started out, I took on a part-time job at a community center while I was in college, but that was more of a volunteer position than a formal job. After I graduated and got my first full-time position in the city, I made the choice to commit fully to that path. I think it's important to be present and give your best to whatever you're doing, and I've always believed that splitting your focus can dilute your impact. Plus, with the demands of my current role, I've learned that working hard and being intentional with my time is more valuable than trying to juggle multiple things at once. I've been lucky to find a job that aligns with my values and gives me a sense of purpose, so I don't see the need to take on anything else.\n\n",

It's been a year of learning to balance the demands of my job, my health, and my personal life. I used to think that pushing through stress was the only way to be productive, but now I realize that taking time to rest and care for myself is just as important. The back pain and anxiety I've dealt with have been reminders that my body and mind need attention, not just my work. At the same time, managing my finances and staying within my budget has shown me how much I value stability and security. I'm learning that being intentional with my time, money, and health is the key to living a meaningful life. I'm grateful for the support I've received from James, my family, and my friends, and I'm trying to be kinder to myself as I navigate the challenges of everyday life.",

I earn a salary from my job in local government, and James has a teaching position at a public school, so our combined income covers most of our expenses. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to keep us comfortable and allow us to contribute to the community in ways that matter to us.

One of the biggest benefits of working for the city is the health insurance coverage\u2014it's comprehensive, and it's something I really appreciate, especially with my back issues and the ongoing need for physical therapy. We also get a generous amount of paid time off, which is something I've come to rely on. I used to think that taking time off was a sign of weakness, but now I see it as a necessary part of staying productive and healthy. We get about 20 days of vacation each year, plus sick days and holidays, which gives me the flexibility to recharge when I need to. Another thing I value is the retirement plan the city offers\u2014it's not perfect, but it's a start, and I contribute as much as I can.

I've been lucky to have a manager, Sarah, who I really respect. She's been in the field for over 20 years and has a deep understanding of the community work we do. She's not just focused on getting things done\u2014she genuinely cares about the people we're trying to help. She's been a great mentor to me, pushing me to think critically and not just follow the status quo.

We've been through a lot together, from late-night meetings to dealing with the frustrations of slow-moving bureaucracy. I think what makes our team strong is that we all share a common purpose, even if we don't always agree on the best way to get there.

I usually start around 8:30 a.m., and I try to leave by 5:30 p.m., but there are days when I stay late for meetings or finish up some reports.

He had a steady job, but it wasn't easy\u2014long hours, not a lot of benefits, and the kind of work that takes a toll on your body. My mom worked part-time at a grocery store, which gave her more flexibility, but it wasn't enough to cover everything. She often had to work double shifts or take on extra hours during the holidays to make ends meet. I remember seeing how hard they both worked, especially during the colder months when the shop was slower and the grocery store had fewer customers. It wasn't always comfortable growing up in a working-class household, but it taught me a lot about resilience, sacrifice, and the value of hard work. I think that's why I ended up choosing a career in community development\u2014because I wanted to help people like them, who are trying to build a better life but don't always have the support or resources they need.\n\n",

He had a small shop in the neighborhood, and he was known for being reliable, even if he wasn't always the most talkative person. His most important duties were diagnosing problems, performing repairs, and making sure customers left with their cars running smoothly. He didn't have a lot of formal training, but he had a natural talent for mechanics and learned most of what he knew through experience and by watching other mechanics work. My mom, on the other hand, worked at a local grocery store, mostly in the produce section. Her job involved restocking shelves, helping customers find what they needed, and making sure the store stayed organized. She had a way of making people feel welcome, even if she was tired after a long shift. Both of them had their own challenges, but they always made sure to put food on the table and give me and my sister the best they could. Looking back, I think their work shaped me in a lot of ways\u2014it showed me the value of hard work, the importance of community, and the kind of resilience that comes from knowing you have to fight for everything you want in life.\n\n",

My dad was one of the lead mechanics there, and he was pretty well-respected for his work. He didn't make a lot of money, but he had a good reputation, and people trusted him. My mom's grocery store was a bit more community-focused too. It wasn't a big chain, and the owners were from the neighborhood, which made it feel like a second home for a lot of people.
