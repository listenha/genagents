She also mentions that she 'didn't want to be someone who just climbed the ladder for the sake of it,' suggesting a reflective, thoughtful, and perhaps introverted nature. While she is clearly engaged in her work and community, she also emphasizes introspection, mindfulness, and a tendency to reflect before acting, which aligns with being reserved.",

While she has made progress, she has not described herself as someone who consistently handles stress well or feels relaxed. Instead, she has acknowledged the emotional and physical toll of her work and life, which suggests she would not rate herself as high on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Melissa describes herself as having a strong interest in politics, social justice, and community development. While she mentions her sister Claire is into art and music, Melissa herself does not express any personal artistic interests.

            "BFI-10_9": "Melissa has described experiencing anxiety, particularly in relation to her work and the political challenges she faces. She also mentioned dealing with back pain and the emotional weight of her job, which can contribute to feelings of stress and nervousness. However, she has also developed coping strategies like mindfulness, journaling, and leaning on her support system, which suggests she manages her anxiety effectively. While she acknowledges feeling overwhelmed at times, she doesn’t describe herself as someone who gets nervous easily, but rather someone who experiences stress and anxiety in response to specific challenges.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Melissa describes herself as someone who was always reading books or getting lost in her thoughts as a child, which suggests she has a reflective and imaginative nature. She also shows a deep engagement with social issues, politics, and community development, which often requires creative problem-solving and thinking beyond the immediate.

            "BFI-10_10": "Melissa mentions in her interview that she was a 'quiet kid, always reading books or getting lost in her thoughts.' She also reflects on her childhood with a sense of introspection and imagination, and she has a deep interest in social issues and community development, which often requires creative problem-solving.
