This suggests he is capable of reasoning well under pressure, but not necessarily excelling in high-stress situations. Therefore, a score of 3 seems most fitting, indicating moderate difficulty reasoning under pressure, but still being able to handle it reasonably well.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Juan Rodriguez does not explicitly mention exceptional logical reasoning abilities. He talks more about his values, activism, and community service. However, he does not express any insecurity about his logical reasoning skills either. His background and current work suggest he is more focused on social and environmental issues rather than analytical pursuits. Therefore, it seems more likely that he would fall towards the middle of the scale, indicating he feels moderately skilled in logical reasoning compared to others.",

Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that Juan would lean towards the higher end of the scale, indicating that logic works well for him in solving problems.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Juan Rodriguez reflects on his decision-making process, particularly mentioning that he trusts his instincts and that decisions 'just happened' sometimes. However, he also acknowledges that he had a clear reason for choosing the non-profit internship over the tech company internship.

This suggests that while he does experience nervousness, it is not a constant or overwhelming issue for him. Therefore, a score of 3 seems most appropriate, but considering the range, a 2 or 3 would be more fitting. Given that he actively manages his stress, a 2 seems slightly more accurate.",
