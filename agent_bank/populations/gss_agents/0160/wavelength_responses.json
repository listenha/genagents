While some horror movies are genuinely terrifying, others may be more about the genre's tropes and less about real fear. Based on my personal experiences, horror movies often fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum—scary enough to be engaging but not so overwhelming that they cause actual fear. I find that most horror movies are crafted to entertain and provoke a reaction, rather than to scare someone to death. However, they are not always thrilling or original, so they can also be boring if they rely too heavily on clichés."

As someone who values education and has pursued a graduate degree in business, I’ve encountered math in both its simpler and more complex forms.

This suggests a sense of progression in the history of life, even if it wasn't a straight path. However, the extinction of dinosaurs was not a result of improvement but rather a random event, like an asteroid impact. I believe the clue 'dinosaur' falls somewhere in the middle, reflecting both the idea of progress and the randomness of historical events."

Instead, it feels like a neutral or even peaceful moment in a new place, which suggests a balanced position between the two extremes.
