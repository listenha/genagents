    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nCynthia Mendoca: I was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, to a family that valued education and hard work, even if we didn't have a lot of money. My parents both only had high school educations, but they always encouraged me and my siblings to pursue our dreams. When I was 16, my family moved to the United States, settling in a small town in Massachusetts. It was a big change for us, adjusting to a new language, culture, and way of life. I remember feeling both excited and overwhelmed, but my parents were determined to give us a better future. I graduated high school and went on to college, eventually earning a graduate degree in business. I married my husband, who is also from Lithuania, and we've built a life together in Connecticut. We have two children, and while we're not wealthy, we're comfortable. I work full time as a financial analyst, and I enjoy speaking both English and Lithuanian, which helps me stay connected to my roots.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nCynthia Mendoca: Yes, there was a moment that truly shaped my path. After moving to the U.S. when I was 16, I struggled with the language and the cultural shift, but I was determined not to let that hold me back. I worked part-time at a local store while attending night classes to improve my English. One day, my high school principal approached me and said she noticed my dedication and suggested I apply for a scholarship to a community college. I was hesitant at first, because I didn't think I was good enough, but she encouraged me to take the chance. I applied, got the scholarship, and that opened the door to higher education. That decision led me to eventually earn my graduate degree, which in turn helped me get the job I have now. It was a turning point because it showed me that even when I felt stuck, there were opportunities if I was willing to reach for them. That lesson has stayed with me, and it's something I try to pass on to my children whenever I can.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nCynthia Mendoca: I think, in that moment, it was a conscious choice, but it wasn't easy. I had to really push myself to believe that I could do it. I remember sitting at my kitchen table, staring at the scholarship application, and wondering if I was even eligible. My parents didn't have much money, and I felt like I was asking for something I didn't deserve. But I kept thinking about how hard my parents had worked to give me a chance, and I didn't want to waste that. So I filled out the application, and I told myself that if I didn't get it, I would still keep trying. That choice to apply, to take that step, was mine. It wasn't just something that happened to me\u2014it was something I decided to do, even when I was scared.\n\n",

She saw something in me that I didn't see in myself at the time. She didn't just hand me the opportunity\u2014she believed in me and pushed me to believe in myself. I think that kind of support is so important, especially for someone who's coming from a different country and trying to navigate a new system. I also think organizations like the community college and the scholarship program played a role by making education accessible to people like me. Without those structures in place, I don't know if I would have had the courage to take that first step. So, yes, I believe that help from others was crucial, but I also believe that taking that step required me to be proactive and open to the support that was available.\n\n",

My husband, Tomas, is also from Lithuania\u2014he grew up in a small town near Vilnius, just like I did. We met in college, actually, through a mutual friend. He was studying engineering, and I was working part-time while taking classes. We bonded over our shared experiences of being immigrants and the challenges that came with it. We got married a few years after I finished my graduate degree, and we moved to Connecticut, where we've been living for the past eight years. Our children are both in school\u2014our daughter is in high school, and our son is in middle school. They're both bilingual, just like me, and they take pride in knowing their Lithuanian heritage. I think it's important for them to understand where we came from, even though we're building our lives here. My husband and I work together to balance our careers and family life, and while it's not always easy, we've created a home that feels warm and supportive. I wouldn't trade this life for anything, even with all the challenges that come with it.\n\n",

Talking about the crossroads I faced when I was 16, and the moment I decided to apply for that scholarship, reminded me how pivotal that choice was. It wasn't easy, but it was mine, and it opened so many doors. I also realized how much I owe to the people and organizations that believed in me, like my high school principal and the scholarship program. Their support was crucial, but it was my own determination that made the difference. Now, as I think about my family\u2014my husband and children\u2014it makes me appreciate how far we've come.

They're proud of what my brother and I have accomplished, even though they never had the chance to go to college themselves. My brother is a teacher in a small town near Vilnius, and my sister works in a local bank. We talk often about our roots and how much our Lithuanian heritage means to us.

One of them is Elena, a childhood friend from Lithuania who also moved to the U.S. around the same time I did. We've been through a lot together\u2014adjusting to life here, navigating college, and even supporting each other through tough times. She's like a sister to me, and even though we don't see each other as often as we'd like, our bond has never weakened. There's also my college professor, Dr. Alvarez, who became a mentor to me during my studies. He saw my potential and encouraged me to think bigger, even when I wasn't sure where I was headed. His guidance helped me land my first job and gave me the confidence to pursue my graduate degree. Then there's my husband's best friend, Andrei, who has been like a brother to me since the day we met. He's always been there with advice, support, and a good laugh.

Our street, Oakridge Lane, is lined with beautiful old homes, many of which have been around for decades. There's a strong sense of community here\u2014people know their neighbors, and there are always events like block parties or holiday gatherings that bring everyone together. I love that my kids can ride their bikes around the neighborhood without worrying about heavy traffic, and there's a local park just a few blocks away where we often have picnics or play sports. The schools in the area are excellent, which was one of the main reasons we chose to move here. Even though I work full time, I try to be involved in my kids' lives as much as possible, whether it's helping with homework or attending school events. I also enjoy the proximity to the coast\u2014on weekends, we like to take short trips to the beach or go for walks along the waterfront.

Tell me about what it\u2019s been like for you living here.\n\nCynthia Mendoca: Living here in Greenwich has been mostly positive, but like anywhere, there are challenges. One of the biggest adjustments was the cost of living. Even though we're not struggling, it's not as easy as it was back in Lithuania, where everything was more affordable. I remember when we first moved here, we had to make some tough decisions about what to prioritize\u2014whether it was saving for our kids' education or upgrading our home. But over time, we've found a good balance. What I appreciate most is the quality of life here. The schools are top-notch, the parks are beautiful, and there's a real sense of community that makes you feel like you belong. That said, I do miss the slower pace of life back home. In Lithuania, people take time to sit outside with coffee, to chat with neighbors, and to enjoy the seasons. Here, life moves a bit faster, and sometimes I feel like I'm constantly juggling work, family, and everything else. But I've learned to embrace that rhythm, and I think it's helped me grow as a person. Overall, I'm happy with the choice we made to settle here, even with its ups and downs.\n\n",

I've started using a cane when I'm out walking for longer periods, and I've made sure to schedule my physical therapy sessions around my work and family commitments. It's not perfect, but it's manageable. I think the biggest challenge has been reminding myself that taking care of my health isn't a luxury\u2014it's a necessity. I don't want my kids to see me struggling or to think that I can push through everything without rest. I want them to understand that taking care of yourself is part of being responsible, not just for your own sake, but for the people who depend on you. So even though it's been a bit of a learning curve, I'm grateful for the reminders that my body needs care, just like everything else in life.\n\n",

It's been a year of growth, but also of reflection. I've been thinking a lot about how far we've come as a family, especially with my kids growing up so fast. Lina is starting to think about college, and it's both exciting and a little bittersweet. I remember when she was just a little girl, running around the park with Jonas, and now she's preparing for the next chapter of her life. I've also been trying to be more present in the moment, whether it's during dinner with my family or helping Jonas with his science projects. There have been challenges, like the ongoing knee pain, but I've learned to adapt and find ways to stay strong. I've also been more involved in our community, especially with the volunteer work I do at the community center.

Growing up in Lithuania, I was raised Protestant, and I remember attending church with my family on Sundays. It was more of a cultural tradition than a deeply personal spiritual practice for me. Over the years, as I've moved through different stages of life\u2014immigrating, building a family, navigating work and health challenges\u2014I've found that my sense of purpose and connection comes more from my relationships, my heritage, and the small moments of gratitude I try to hold onto each day.

I find that my life is already so full with work, family, and the little traditions I try to keep alive from Lithuania that I don't have much time or energy for scrolling through feeds. When I do use my phone, it's mostly for staying in touch with my parents and siblings back home\u2014video calls, sending photos of the kids, or just sharing a few words about our day. I also follow a few community groups online, like the one for Lithuanian immigrants in the U.S., where people share recipes, cultural events, and support each other through challenges. It's nice to feel connected to others who understand what it's like to build a life in a new place. But I think I prefer face-to-face connections\u2014whether it's with my neighbors, my friends, or my family.

For me, support has always come from the people I know in real life\u2014my family, my friends, and the community here in Greenwich. That said, I have used online groups, like the Lithuanian immigrant community I mentioned earlier, to find advice or encouragement when I needed it. For example, when I was dealing with the knee pain, I posted a question in one of those groups, and a few people shared their own experiences and even recommended physical therapists they had used. It wasn't the same as talking to someone face-to-face, but it was helpful in a different way. I think it's important to have those options, especially for people who might not have a strong support network nearby.

The majority of that goes toward our kids' education-related costs\u2014like school supplies, extracurricular fees, and college prep materials for Lina.

For example, in the winter, our heating bill tends to go up, and we also spend more on groceries because we're cooking more meals at home to save money. Then, when the kids go back to school in the fall, there are additional costs for supplies, uniforms, and extracurricular activities. Around the holidays, we also budget extra for things like gift-giving and family dinners, which can add up. On the other hand, during the summer, when the kids are out of school, we spend less on school-related expenses, but we might have more costs for summer camps or family trips.

Talking about my stress levels and how they've shifted over the past year reminded me of the bittersweet journey of watching my children grow up and preparing for their futures. It also made me think about how important it is to find small, meaningful ways to cope\u2014like cooking Lithuanian meals, taking walks with my kids, or journaling to process my thoughts. Discussing my household budget and expenses brought up the reality of balancing financial responsibilities with the needs of my family, and how we've managed to find a rhythm that works for us. It also made me appreciate the sacrifices we've made to provide for our children while maintaining a sense of stability. These questions helped me see how much I've grown in learning to manage stress, stay grounded in my values, and find gratitude in the everyday moments that shape my life.",

That includes my full-time salary as a financial analyst and my husband's income from his engineering job. We've always tried to be transparent about our finances, and I think it's important for our kids to understand how we manage money, even if they're not old enough to handle it themselves yet. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our expenses and still allow us to save a little each month. I've always believed that financial stability is about more than just making money\u2014it's about knowing where your money is going and being able to make choices that support your family's well-being. I'm proud of how we've built a life here, even with the challenges, and I hope my children grow up understanding the value of hard work, responsibility, and planning for the future.\n\n",

The benefits package is pretty comprehensive\u2014health insurance covers both my husband and me, which is a huge relief, especially with my knee issues. We also get paid time off, including vacation days and sick leave, which has been important for maintaining a work-life balance. One of the things I appreciate most is the flexibility they offer, like the option to work from home a few days a week, which has been a lifesaver when I need to manage my physical therapy appointments or spend more time with the kids. The company also offers professional development opportunities, which I've taken advantage of by attending workshops on financial modeling and leadership. It's not perfect, but I feel lucky to have a job that supports both my career and my family's needs.\n\n",

I think she sees potential in me, and that's been motivating. As for my coworkers, most of them are friendly and collaborative. We work on different projects together, and while there are moments of stress or tight deadlines, I find that the team is always willing to help each other out.

My manager is understanding of the need for balance, and she encourages us to take time off when necessary. That said, there are times when I have to stay late or come in on weekends, especially during busy seasons.

My father worked as a mechanic at a local garage, and my mother was a cleaner at a school. They both worked long hours, often from early morning until late afternoon, and sometimes even into the evening, especially during the school year. I remember seeing them come home tired but always trying to make sure we had enough food, clothes, and a stable home. They never complained about the work, even though it wasn't easy.

I think their hard work taught me the value of perseverance and responsibility, even though they didn't have much education themselves.

Their most important activities were ensuring that the cars they repaired ran smoothly and that the school buildings were clean and safe for the students. My father would often come home with grease on his hands and a tired look in his eyes, but he always made time to talk to us about his day, even if it was just for a few minutes. My mother, on the other hand, would come home with a mop in hand, still cleaning even after she got home. I remember her telling me that she felt proud when she saw the kids at the school smiling after she had finished her work. Both of them had a strong work ethic, and they always put our needs first, even when it meant working extra hours or sacrificing their own comfort.

The garage was run by my uncle, who had been in the business for years, and my father was one of the main mechanics there. He would diagnose car problems, perform repairs, and even teach me a few things about engines when I was older. The school my mother worked at was a middle school, and her job involved cleaning classrooms, restrooms, and common areas, as well as helping with special events and ensuring the school was a safe and welcoming place for students. She would often tell me how important it was to take pride in her work, even if it wasn't always easy. Both of them were part of the same community, and their jobs were deeply tied to the people around them. I remember my father fixing cars for neighbors who couldn't afford much, and my mother cleaning the school gym before big events so the kids could have a good experience. Their work wasn't just about money\u2014it was about helping others and contributing to the life of the town in their own way.
