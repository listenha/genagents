            "REI_6": "Abby describes herself as someone who reflects deeply on her decisions, values intentionality, and is guided by her values and faith. While she is thoughtful and analytical in her work (e.g., policy analysis), she also emphasizes emotional and spiritual aspects of her life. She doesn't present herself as primarily a logical thinker, but rather as someone who balances logic with empathy and reflection. This suggests she would not rate herself as significantly above average in logical reasoning.",
            "REI_7": "Abby demonstrates a thoughtful and reflective approach to her life and work, often considering the broader impact of her decisions and the values that guide her. While she is deeply committed to her work in education equity and shows a strong sense of purpose, her narrative emphasizes emotional intelligence, community, and personal reflection over purely logical or analytical reasoning. She reflects on her choices with a focus on meaning and connection, which suggests she may not identify strongly with being a 'logical mind' in the strictest sense.",
