  "agent_profile_summary": "Abby Schweighardt, a 27-year-old policy analyst in Evanston, Illinois, grew up in a small town in the East North Central region, where her parents' careers in education and healthcare instilled in her a deep commitment to service and equity. After graduating with a sociology degree, she chose to pursue a master’s in public policy over social work, a decision she made on a quiet evening on her parents’ porch, gazing at the lake, and reflecting on the impact she wanted to make. Now married to Daniel, a sustainability consultant, she balances her nonprofit work in education equity with a strong sense of community, often volunteering with local literacy programs and enjoying walks by the lake. Her life is shaped by a tension between the demands of her career and the desire for balance, but she remains grounded in her values, guided by faith, family, and the belief that small, intentional choices—like morning coffee on the porch or mentoring students—can create meaningful change."
