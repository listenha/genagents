She also mentions that she didn't always feel confident enough to reach out to mentors or organizations during key moments in her life. While she has grown more confident over time, especially in her academic and community roles, she still seems to value quiet reflection and thoughtful action over being the center of attention. This suggests she may still see herself as somewhat reserved, though not extremely so.",

She has spoken positively about her relationships, including her manager and coworkers, and has expressed gratitude for the people who have believed in her.

However, there is no mention of any specific artistic interests such as painting, music, or creative writing. She does not express any engagement with artistic hobbies or activities beyond reading. Given this, it is more likely she would rate herself lower on the scale of having artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Jessica describes herself as someone who values close relationships with family and friends, but she also mentions that she is often juggling school, work, and family responsibilities. While she has a strong support system and engages with her community (e.g., volunteering at the library, working at a bookstore), she does not explicitly describe herself as outgoing or sociable.

            "BFI-10_10": "Jessica reflects on her life with a strong sense of purpose, resilience, and determination. While she is deeply engaged in her studies, community work, and family responsibilities, there is no explicit mention of her engaging in creative or imaginative activities.

            "BFI-10_4": "Jessica has described experiencing significant stress, anxiety, and challenges in managing her responsibilities, including school, work, family, and health. While she has made progress in coping strategies like mindfulness and journaling, she also acknowledges that she still struggles with stress and has had to take breaks due to health issues. This suggests she does not see herself as someone who handles stress exceptionally well, but she is working on it.",

She focuses on education, family, work, and community service, and there is no indication that she engages in or values artistic pursuits. Her narrative centers on resilience, responsibility, and academic goals, with no mention of hobbies or interests related to the arts.",

She also volunteers at the library and works at a bookstore, which are social environments. However, she does not describe herself as particularly outgoing or sociable in a broad sense.

Her self-awareness and efforts to cope suggest she would not rate herself as a 5, but she also wouldn't rate herself as a 1, as she is making progress.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Jessica demonstrates a reflective and thoughtful nature, often considering her future, her family, and her community. While she is deeply committed to her goals and responsibilities, there is no explicit mention of her engaging in creative or imaginative activities.
