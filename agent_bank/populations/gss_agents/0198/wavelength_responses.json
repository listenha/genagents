While many things do have clear causes (like poor planning or lack of preparation), there are also moments where things go wrong despite our best efforts, which feels more random. My work in community advocacy has shown me that while systemic issues can be addressed and changed (causality), there are also unpredictable challenges that arise from circumstances beyond our control (randomness).

However, I do not view it as overly aggressive in the sense of being confrontational or forceful. Instead, it is more about proactive investment and long-term growth. Given my values of balance and thoughtful action, I would place it somewhere in the middle, leaning slightly toward the aggressive side due to the risk and assertiveness involved in venture capital decisions."

However, it's not overly bold or vibrant.
