Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nKevin Kozlowski: I was born and raised in Chicago, on the South Side, and I've always had a strong connection to the city. My parents were both working-class folks who didn't have a lot of formal education\u2014my dad worked as a mechanic, and my mom was a nurse's aide. They always emphasized the importance of hard work and doing the right thing, even if they didn't have much to give. I grew up in a tight-knit neighborhood, where everyone knew each other, and I had a pretty typical childhood\u2014playing outside with friends, going to church with my family when I was younger, and always being encouraged to do well in school. I was the first in my family to go to college, which was a big deal for them. I ended up studying business, which I thought would give me a good foundation for whatever I wanted to do. After college, I landed a job in marketing, and I've been working full time ever since. I've never been married, and I've always been focused on my career and personal growth. Life hasn't been without its challenges, but I've always tried to stay grounded and make the best of what I have.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nKevin Kozlowski: Yeah, there was definitely a crossroads. I was in my second year of college, studying business, and I had this internship opportunity at a local startup that was doing some pretty cool work in the tech space. At the same time, my parents were going through a tough time financially\u2014my dad had gotten laid off, and my mom was working double shifts. I felt like I needed to step in and help out, so I almost turned down the internship to take a part-time job at a local store to support them. But then I talked to my mom one night, and she said something that stuck with me. She told me, 'You have to think about your future, Kevin. We'll manage somehow, but if you don't take this chance, you'll always wonder what could have been.' That really hit me. I took the internship, and it changed everything. I got exposed to a whole new world of possibilities, met people who became mentors, and it ultimately led me to the career I have today. I think that moment defined me because it taught me the importance of balancing responsibility with ambition, and it showed me that sometimes the hardest decisions are the ones that lead to the most growth.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nKevin Kozlowski: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made easily. I had to weigh my responsibilities to my family against my own dreams, and it wasn't just about one decision\u2014it was about how I approached everything after that. I remember lying awake at night, thinking about what my mom said, and realizing that she wasn't just being selfless; she was giving me a chance to build something better for both of us. So I made the choice to take the internship, but I also made a promise to myself that I wouldn't forget where I came from. That decision didn't just shape my career\u2014it shaped who I am as a person. I think that's what makes it so meaningful. It wasn't just about taking a path; it was about understanding the weight of the choices we make and the impact they have on the people we love.\n\n",

My parents were pretty proud and didn't want to burden anyone else, but looking back, I wish I had reached out more to the community centers or local nonprofits that were around. There were programs for families in need, and I think if I had taken advantage of those, it might have eased some of the pressure on my parents. I also think my college advisors could have done more to connect me with financial aid or work-study opportunities. It's funny, though\u2014I didn't realize how much support was out there at the time. I guess that's another lesson: sometimes we don't ask for help because we don't want to seem like we're struggling, but in the end, it's better to ask than to suffer in silence.\n\n",

My parents are still in Chicago, and even though they've both retired, they're doing well. My mom still volunteers at the local hospital, and my dad keeps himself busy with some side projects around the house. I visit them as much as I can, especially on holidays or weekends when work isn't too demanding. I also have a few cousins who live in the area, and we keep in touch\u2014sometimes we get together for family dinners or just hang out at the park. I think the most important thing for me is that I've never lost touch with where I came from. Even though I've built a life for myself, I always make sure to stay connected to my roots. I guess I'm not ready for a partner or kids just yet, but when the time comes, I want to make sure I'm in a place where I can give them the same kind of love and support that my parents gave me.\n\n",

While I was focused on school and work, she went into the arts\u2014she's a graphic designer and runs her own small studio. We didn't always see eye to eye growing up; she was more free-spirited, and I was the more practical one. But over the years, we've grown closer. She's always been there for me, even when I wasn't sure I needed her. We talk a lot, especially about life choices and what we want for the future. I admire her for taking risks and living the way she wants to. She's the one who encouraged me to think bigger when I was stuck in my routine.

One of them is Mike, who I met in college. We were in the same business program, and we ended up rooming together for a couple of semesters. Mike was always the more outgoing one, and he pushed me to get involved in campus activities that I probably wouldn't have done on my own.

It's a bit more upscale than where I grew up, but I like that it still has that community feel. There are a lot of young professionals and families in the area, and I've really come to appreciate the mix of cultures and the sense of safety that comes with it. I live in a one-bedroom apartment, which is just enough for me\u2014no need for extra space when I'm single and focused on my work.

The upside is the sense of stability and the opportunities that come with being in a more established part of the city. I've been able to build a routine that works for me\u2014early mornings at the gym, a good commute to work, and evenings spent either catching up on work or just relaxing with a book on the rooftop.

I usually wake up around 6:30 a.m., make a quick breakfast, and head to the gym for an hour or so. That's something I've made a habit of since moving to the North Side\u2014it helps me stay grounded and focused. From there, I commute into the city for work, which is about a 20-minute drive. My job in marketing keeps me pretty busy, so most days are similar: meetings, emails, and working on campaigns. I try to take lunch breaks outside when I can, sometimes grabbing a sandwich from one of the local cafes nearby. In the afternoons, I might meet up with a coworker for coffee or just work through the rest of the day.

I've been seeing a chiropractor every few weeks, and they've been helping me manage it with adjustments and some exercises.

Tell me all about how you have been feeling.\n\nKevin Kozlowski: Over the past year, I've been feeling pretty good overall, though there have been moments of reflection and growth. Life has been busy with work, but I've also made an effort to slow down and appreciate the little things. I've been more intentional about my time, whether it's spending weekends with my parents, catching up with my sister, or just enjoying the peace of the lakefront. I've also been thinking a lot about where I want to go next\u2014both professionally and personally. I've started looking into some leadership training programs at work, which has been exciting but also a bit intimidating. It's a reminder that growth doesn't stop once you've achieved a certain level of success. I've also been trying to stay connected to my Polish heritage in more meaningful ways, like attending a few cultural events and reconnecting with some old family friends who moved back to Chicago. It's been a year of balance\u2014between keeping my feet on the ground and reaching for something bigger. I know I'm not perfect, but I feel like I'm moving in the right direction, and that gives me a sense of peace.\n\n",

I've always known the importance of taking care of my body, especially after seeing how hard my parents worked to give me a good life, but it's only recently that I've started to truly prioritize it in a consistent way. I've also come to realize that health isn't just about physical fitness\u2014it's about mental and emotional balance too. The back pain I've been dealing with is a reminder that even small changes, like posture and stretching, can have a big impact. I'm grateful for the support of my environment and the routines I've built, but I know there's still more to learn. It's comforting to know that I'm not perfect, but I'm making an effort to grow and stay grounded in the things that matter most.",

My mom still volunteers at the hospital, which gives her a sense of purpose, and my dad has taken up some small home improvement projects, which keeps him busy and engaged.

I was raised Catholic, and I remember going to church with my family when I was younger\u2014it was a part of our routine, and I appreciated the sense of community and structure it provided. But as I got older, especially after college, I started to question a lot of things. I didn't feel like I needed to follow the same path my parents did, and I found myself more interested in personal reflection than in organized religion. Now, I wouldn't say I'm spiritual in the traditional sense, but I do believe in the importance of mindfulness, gratitude, and staying connected to the people and values that matter most. I think of it more as a way of living than a belief system. I still respect the role religion played in shaping my early life, and I appreciate the traditions I grew up with, but I've come to see spirituality as something more personal and flexible.

I've always been more of a private person, and I find that platforms like Facebook or Instagram can be a bit overwhelming with all the noise and comparisons. That said, I do use LinkedIn occasionally for professional networking, especially when I'm looking into new opportunities or connecting with people in my industry.

For example, during the winter months, my heating bill went up a bit, which is something I didn't budget for as much as I should have.

My salary as a marketing manager covers most of it, and I've been fortunate to have a stable position that allows me to meet my expenses without too much stress. I know it's not a huge amount, but it's enough to live comfortably, save a little, and still enjoy the things that matter most\u2014like spending time with family or taking a walk by the lake. I've always been careful with money, especially growing up in a working-class family, so I try to stick to a budget and not overspend. It's not about luxury for me\u2014it's about stability and being prepared for whatever comes next.\n\n",

The company has a strong culture that values teamwork and innovation, which I really appreciate. As for the benefits, we have a solid health insurance plan that covers most of my medical needs, including the chiropractic care I've been using for my back pain. We also get a generous amount of paid time off\u2014about three weeks of vacation, plus sick days and holidays. I think the most important thing for me is that the company offers a flexible work schedule, which helps me maintain that balance between work and personal life. I've seen a lot of people in my industry burn out because they don't take enough time to rest, and I want to make sure I don't end up in that place. The benefits aren't just about money or perks\u2014they're about supporting a sustainable lifestyle, and I feel lucky to have that in my job.\n\n",

My manager is someone I respect a lot; she's been a mentor to me since I started and has always encouraged me to take on challenges that push me out of my comfort zone. She's fair, transparent, and doesn't hesitate to give feedback when needed. I think that's one of the reasons I've been able to grow so much in this role. As for my coworkers, we have a good dynamic. We collaborate a lot, especially when we're working on tight deadlines, and I've built some really strong friendships with a few of them. We're all in the same boat, trying to make our campaigns work and meet client expectations, so there's a sense of camaraderie. That said, I'm not one to get too close professionally\u2014I think there's a balance between being a team player and maintaining personal boundaries. I value the relationships I have at work, but I also know that my family and personal life are what truly ground me.

Most days, I start around 9 a.m. and leave around 6 p.m., though I often stay a little later when we're wrapping up a big campaign or preparing for a client meeting. The company allows for some remote work, which I've taken advantage of a few times, especially when I need to focus or when I'm feeling under the weather. That said, I do prefer being in the office most of the time because I find that in-person collaboration sparks more creativity and keeps the team aligned. I also appreciate that I can adjust my hours a bit if needed, which helps me maintain that balance between work and personal life.

He always said he liked the hands-on work, even though it was physically demanding.

What were their most important activities or duties?\n\nKevin Kozlowski: My dad was a mechanic, and his most important duties involved diagnosing and repairing cars, trucks, and other vehicles that came into the garage. He had a real knack for figuring out what was wrong with a machine just by listening to it or looking at it\u2014like he could tell if something was off without even touching the engine. He worked long hours, often coming in early and staying late, especially when the shop was busy or when a customer needed something fixed right away. He always took pride in his work, and I remember him telling me that he didn't just fix cars; he fixed people's lives, because without a working vehicle, a lot of folks couldn't get to work or take care of their families. My mom, on the other hand, worked as a nurse's aide, which meant she was on her feet all day, helping patients with their daily needs\u2014feeding them, helping them move, and just being there for them when they needed someone to talk to. She had a quiet strength about her, and I think that's why she was so respected at the hospital.

The crossroads moment in college, where I chose to take the internship over a part-time job to support my parents, was a defining point in my life. It taught me the importance of balancing responsibility with ambition, and that decision ultimately led me to the career I have now. I've also come to appreciate the support systems I had, even if I didn't realize it at the time. My parents' sacrifices, my sister's encouragement, and the friends I've made along the way have all played a role in shaping my path.
