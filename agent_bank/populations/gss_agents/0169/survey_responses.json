            "REI_1": "Kevin Kozlowski has demonstrated problem-solving skills in his career as a marketing manager, where he oversees campaigns, analyzes data, and collaborates with teams.

            "REI_2": "Kevin has demonstrated strong problem-solving skills in his career as a marketing manager, where he oversees campaigns, analyzes data, and collaborates with teams. He also shows reflective and strategic thinking in his life decisions, such as choosing an internship over a part-time job, which required careful consideration of long-term goals. These traits suggest he is comfortable with logical analysis and likely disagrees with the statement.",
            "REI_3": "Kevin Kozlowski describes himself as a marketing manager who works on campaigns and strategies, which requires some level of analytical thinking. However, he also emphasizes personal reflection, mindfulness, and emotional balance in his life. He does not explicitly mention being highly analytical, and his focus on community, family, and personal growth suggests a more intuitive or balanced approach to thinking. This makes it more likely he would lean toward the middle or lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_4": "Kevin Kozlowski demonstrates a thoughtful and reflective nature throughout the interview. He carefully considers his decisions, such as choosing the internship over a part-time job, and reflects on his life, values, and future goals with intentionality. He also shows a strong ability to analyze his experiences, weigh options, and make deliberate choices. This suggests he is someone who does reason things out carefully.",

            "REI_6": "Kevin Kozlowski describes himself as someone who values balance, reflection, and personal growth. He often speaks about making decisions based on a mix of personal values, family influences, and emotional considerations. While he is thoughtful and strategic in his career (e.g., choosing the internship over a part-time job), he does not emphasize logical reasoning as a defining strength. Instead, he highlights emotional intelligence, family support, and mindfulness. This suggests he may not see himself as particularly strong in logical reasoning compared to others.",
            "REI_7": "Kevin describes himself as a marketing manager who works on campaigns, analyzes data, and collaborates with teams. He mentions making decisions based on balancing responsibility with ambition, and he reflects on his choices with thoughtful reasoning. While he is not explicitly described as highly analytical or logical, he does show a tendency to weigh options carefully and think through the consequences of his actions. This suggests he leans toward the middle or upper range of logical thinking.",
            "REI_8": "Kevin Kozlowski demonstrates a thoughtful and reflective nature throughout the interview.

            "REI_9": "Kevin Kozlowski demonstrates a balanced approach to life, often reflecting on his decisions and considering both practical and emotional factors. While he values stability, responsibility, and growth, he also emphasizes the importance of family, community, and personal connections. He has made thoughtful, deliberate choices (like taking the internship over a part-time job) that reflect a mix of logic and emotional considerations. However, he does not explicitly emphasize logic as his primary decision-making tool, suggesting he may lean more toward a middle ground.",
