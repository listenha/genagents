            "BFI-10_1": "Kevin Kozlowski describes himself as someone who values personal connections but also maintains boundaries, especially at work. He mentions preferring face-to-face conversations over social media, and he reflects on his relationships with family and friends in a thoughtful, but not overly emotional, way. He also shows a tendency to be intentional and reflective, which suggests a more reserved nature. He does not appear to be overly expressive or outspoken in the interview, which aligns more with a lower score on the reserved scale.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Kevin Kozlowski demonstrates a strong sense of connection and trust in his relationships, particularly with his family and close friends. He values support systems, has a deep appreciation for the people who have helped him, and shows a willingness to lean on others when needed. He also reflects on the importance of community and has a positive outlook on people like his parents, sister, and coworkers. These traits align with a higher level of trust.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Throughout the interview, Kevin consistently demonstrates a strong work ethic, responsibility, and dedication to his goals. He talks about his job in marketing, his commitment to personal growth, and his efforts to maintain a healthy lifestyle. He also reflects on the sacrifices his parents made and how he wants to avoid repeating their struggles by being responsible and proactive. These traits are inconsistent with seeing himself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Kevin has reflected on his stress levels and emotional coping strategies multiple times during the interview. He mentions that his stress levels have decreased over the past year, and he has developed strategies like mindfulness, setting boundaries, and relying on family and friends for support. He also talks about being intentional with his time and making peace with not having everything figured out. These behaviors and reflections align with someone who handles stress well and maintains a relaxed demeanor.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Kevin mentions his sister Anna is a graphic designer and runs her own studio, indicating an appreciation for artistic endeavors. He also reflects on his own life with a focus on practicality and structure, but there's no indication he has an aversion to or disinterest in artistic activities. He does not express any artistic interests himself, but he also does not reject or dismiss them. Given the lack of explicit artistic engagement or interest in his life, a score of 2 or 3 might be more accurate, but based on the absence of any artistic inclinations mentioned, a 1 is a plausible lower end response.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Kevin mentions having friends from college and coworkers who have become good friends, but he also emphasizes that he is single and focused on his career and personal growth. He describes himself as someone who values family and personal connections but does not seem to prioritize large social gatherings or being the center of attention. He also mentions that he prefers face-to-face interactions over social media, which suggests a more private or introspective nature. While he is sociable in certain contexts, he does not appear to be highly outgoing or sociable in a broad, extroverted sense.",

He talks about his parents with deep respect, acknowledges his own flaws, and emphasizes the importance of support systems and personal growth.

There is no indication that he tends to find fault with others, and instead, he focuses on personal development and maintaining positive relationships.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Throughout the interview, Kevin consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and a commitment to doing well in his career. He spoke about his role as a marketing manager with a focus on strategy, data analysis, and client satisfaction, all of which require thoroughness. Additionally, he reflected on his parents' work ethic and how it influenced him, suggesting that he values completing tasks carefully and with care.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Kevin describes himself as someone who has faced challenges in life, such as financial struggles in his family and making important decisions like choosing an internship over a part-time job. However, he also emphasizes his ability to stay grounded, make thoughtful decisions, and manage stress through routines like meditation, exercise, and connecting with family and friends. He reflects on his life with a sense of peace and balance, suggesting he is generally calm and composed.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Kevin Kozlowski describes himself as someone who values structure, routine, and stability.
