  "agent_profile_summary": "Kevin Kozlowski, a 30-year-old marketing manager in Chicago, grew up on the South Side in a working-class family where his parents instilled a strong work ethic and the value of hard-earned stability. A pivotal moment came during his second year of college when he chose to take a tech internship over a part-time job to support his family, a decision that ultimately shaped his career path. Now living in a quiet North Side apartment, he balances his professional life with volunteering at a nonprofit that supports youth education and maintaining ties to his Polish heritage through cooking and cultural events. His life reflects a continuous effort to honor his roots while embracing growth, navigating the tension between ambition and gratitude, and fostering meaningful connections with family and community."
