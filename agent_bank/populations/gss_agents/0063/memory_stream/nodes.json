Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nLinda Ng: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Hong Kong, but my parents decided to move to Madison, Wisconsin when I was just six months old. Growing up, I lived with my parents, who were both professionals\u2014my father worked in finance and my mother was a teacher. We moved around a bit within the East North Central region, eventually settling in Madison when I was 12. I always felt a strong sense of community here, which I think influenced my conservative views. My parents instilled a lot of values in me, including the importance of education and hard work. I attended a public school in Madison and was fortunate to have great teachers who inspired me to pursue higher education. After graduating high school, I went on to get a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Since then, I've been working part-time while trying to figure out what my next steps will be. It's been quite a journey so far!\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nLinda Ng: One such moment was during my senior year of college when I had to choose between pursuing a Master's degree and starting my career. I was offered a job at a local tech firm right after graduation, but also had an acceptance letter for a Master's program in Finance. Both options seemed promising, but I knew I needed to make a decision quickly. In the end, I chose the job because I wanted to gain practical experience and see how things worked in the real world first. This decision has definitely shaped who I am today, as I now have a clearer idea of what kind of work environment suits me best.\n\n",

I knew that getting a Master's degree would open up more doors in the future, but I also didn't want to miss out on the opportunity to gain some real-world experience right away. So, in a way, it was a conscious decision, but it also felt like the natural progression given my circumstances at the time. Looking back, I'm glad I took the job, as it gave me valuable insights that I wouldn't have otherwise gained.\n\n",

I try to take breaks throughout the day to walk around and clear my mind, as sitting at a desk all day can be exhausting. In the evenings, I try to unwind by reading or watching TV.

After school, they might join a sports team or participate in an extracurricular activity like music lessons or art club.

Balancing work, social life, and personal growth can be quite demanding. To cope with this, I've been relying more on mindfulness exercises and setting clear boundaries. I've also found it helpful to have a standing desk, which has improved my comfort and productivity. Additionally, I've been reaching out to my friends and family more frequently, which has provided a nice distraction and emotional support. It's important to me to maintain a healthy routine, even if it means making small adjustments to fit in exercise and relaxation time.\n\n",

Rent is the most significant chunk, as I pay $900 for a one-bedroom apartment in Maplewood. Utilities, including internet and electricity, usually cost around $200. Groceries are another big expense, but I try to shop smart and buy in bulk when possible. Other expenses include transportation, which I cover with a monthly transit pass, and entertainment, which isn't as frequent as I'd like but is important for my mental health.\n\n",

It's a decent amount, but I try to manage it carefully to ensure we can cover everything without too much stress.

In the colder months, heating costs have been a bit higher, and I've noticed my utility bills go up a little. Summer tends to be more affordable since we don't need to heat the place as much. Around holidays, grocery expenses spike a bit as we buy more food and gifts.

    "content": "Completing this interview and sharing my life story has been both enlightening and cathartic. It allowed me to reflect on the various choices and experiences that have shaped who I am today. From the early days in Hong Kong to my current life in Madison, Wisconsin, every decision, whether it was pursuing a job or further education, has played a role in defining my values and outlook. The narrative of my life is a testament to the importance of community, relationships, and personal growth. Through the conversations, I realized how much my family has supported me, even from afar, and how much I miss their presence in my daily life. The journey has been marked by challenges, such as balancing work and personal life, but it has also brought moments of joy and fulfillment. Reflecting on these conversations, I am grateful for the insights gained and the clarity in understanding the interconnectedness of my life's journey.",
