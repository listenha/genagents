These situations felt more like the result of predictable human error than pure randomness.

While some might argue that their evolution led to later species, the fact that they went extinct and were not part of the direct lineage of modern humans makes their story more aligned with randomness than with a continuous improvement narrative."

Given that I've grown up in a working-class environment and value community and responsibility, I see drinking more as a neutral or situational activity.

It suggests a moment of reflection in a new place, possibly under the glow of a candle, which could symbolize warmth, comfort, or memory. While it hints at being in a new city (which might imply wanderlust), the mention of candlelight feels intimate and nostalgic, leaning more toward a sense of longing for home or a familiar place.

I’ve had moments where I felt the pressure to be involved in everything, but I’ve also learned to recognize when it’s necessary to take a step back.

In my life, I’ve received notes that were warm and personal, like from my sister or parents, which felt meaningful and full of love. These notes were clearly on the 'warm and fuzzy' side. However, I’ve also seen notes that were brief and utilitarian, like a reminder from a coworker or a simple message without much emotional investment. Based on my experiences, I believe a hand-written note is more likely to be warm and fuzzy than cold and jagged, especially when it’s from someone close. Still, it depends on the intent and content, so I place it slightly toward the warm side but not entirely at 100."

I've seen this in my own life, like when I missed a deadline due to a series of small missteps, or when unexpected problems arose from things I thought were under control.
