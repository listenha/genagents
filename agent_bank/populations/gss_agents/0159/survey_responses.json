            "BFI-10_4": "The participant has discussed moments of stress and burnout, particularly during college and in his current life, but also described learning to manage stress through exercise, journaling, and seeking support from friends and family. While he acknowledges that he still has days where he feels overwhelmed, he has made progress in recognizing stress and taking steps to address it.

However, he has also shown growth in managing his stress through routines, mindfulness, and support systems. He does not appear to be someone who gets nervous easily in most situations, but he is not entirely free of anxiety either.

He also mentions not being into politics and preferring to focus on building a stable life. While he has close relationships with family and friends, he also mentions being more of a private person and not being into the 'influencer' culture of social media.

While he has made progress in managing his stress, he still acknowledges moments of feeling overwhelmed. This suggests he would not score a 5, but he also doesn’t seem to be someone who is consistently overwhelmed or unable to manage stress, which would suggest a 1. A middle score of 3 seems most accurate, as he is actively working on improving his ability to handle stress but still faces challenges.",

            "BFI-10_4": "Marcus has described experiencing stress and burnout in the past, especially during college and when juggling work, volunteering, and personal projects. He has also mentioned learning to recognize when he is overwhelmed and taking steps to address it, such as going for a run, calling his sister, or journaling.

            "BFI-10_5": "The participant mentioned being into comic books and science fiction as a teenager, which suggests some engagement with creative or artistic interests. Additionally, they mentioned reading as a routine and having an interest in building things (e.g., software development, personal projects). While they may not identify as an artist, they do have some artistic or creative inclinations, which would place them somewhere in the middle of the range. However, since the question is about 'few artistic interests,' and the participant doesn’t explicitly mention any strong artistic hobbies or pursuits, they are more likely to lean toward the lower end of the scale.",

While he has made progress, he still acknowledges moments of feeling overwhelmed, particularly when juggling multiple responsibilities. This suggests he is not entirely free of nervousness but has developed coping strategies, placing him somewhere in the middle of the range.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Marcus Johnson mentioned growing up as a 'quiet kid, always reading books or drawing' and being 'into comic books and science fiction' as a teenager.

            "BFI-10_1": "Marcus describes himself as someone who has been quiet as a kid, enjoys reading and reflecting, and values real, meaningful connections over online validation. While he is not shy or withdrawn, he does not actively seek the spotlight or engage in overly social behavior. He prefers deep, meaningful relationships over superficial ones, which aligns more with a moderate level of reserve rather than being very reserved or very outgoing.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Marcus has demonstrated a strong sense of gratitude and a desire to give back, which suggests a trusting nature. He values relationships, especially with family and friends, and has spoken about the importance of community and support systems.

He is clearly driven, responsible, and proactive in his life, which strongly suggests he would not see himself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Marcus has openly discussed his struggles with stress and anxiety, particularly during college and in his early career. He has described moments of burnout and has had to learn how to manage stress through mindfulness, exercise, and support from friends and family. While he has made progress, he still acknowledges that he can feel overwhelmed at times, especially when juggling multiple responsibilities. This suggests that his self-perception of stress management is somewhere in the middle, but not at the highest end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Marcus mentions enjoying comic books and science fiction as a teenager, which suggests an interest in creative and imaginative pursuits. He also volunteers at a community center and mentors others, which could involve creative or expressive elements. While he doesn’t explicitly mention artistic hobbies like painting or music, his background in reading, storytelling, and his passion for tech (which often involves creative problem-solving) suggest a moderate to high level of interest in artistic or creative activities.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Marcus describes himself as someone who values real, meaningful connections but is not overly focused on being the center of attention. He mentions having close friends and family, but also reflects on how he used to be a 'quiet kid' who was more into reading and drawing. He is sociable in a thoughtful, intentional way, not necessarily in a large or outgoing sense. He also mentions that he hasn't been focused on relationships and has been more focused on personal goals and community work. This suggests he is more on the introverted or moderately sociable side of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Marcus Johnson comes across as reflective, empathetic, and focused on personal growth and giving back to his community. He emphasizes gratitude, support from others, and the importance of relationships. He does not exhibit tendencies to criticize or find fault with others; instead, he acknowledges his own struggles and the support he has received. His narrative is centered on collaboration, understanding, and community, which aligns with a low score on this question.",

            "BFI-10_9": "Marcus has discussed experiencing anxiety during college, especially when making major life decisions like turning down a stable job to pursue education. He also mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times when juggling work, volunteering, and personal goals. However, he has also made progress in managing his anxiety through counseling, mindfulness, and support from friends and family. This suggests he would not rate himself as extremely nervous (5), but he also wouldn’t rate himself as completely free from nervousness (1). His self-awareness and efforts to manage stress indicate a moderate level of nervousness.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Marcus mentioned growing up with a love for comic books and science fiction, which are strongly tied to imagination. He also described his current work in software development as something he 'enjoy[s]' and 'use[s] the skills I learned in college,' suggesting a creative and problem-solving mindset.
