            "BFI-10_4": "The participant has discussed moments of stress and burnout, particularly during college and in his current life, but also described learning to manage stress through exercise, journaling, and seeking support from friends and family. While he acknowledges that he still has days where he feels overwhelmed, he has made progress in recognizing stress and taking steps to address it.

However, he has also shown growth in managing his stress through routines, mindfulness, and support systems. He does not appear to be someone who gets nervous easily in most situations, but he is not entirely free of anxiety either.

He also mentions not being into politics and preferring to focus on building a stable life. While he has close relationships with family and friends, he also mentions being more of a private person and not being into the 'influencer' culture of social media.

While he has made progress in managing his stress, he still acknowledges moments of feeling overwhelmed. This suggests he would not score a 5, but he also doesn’t seem to be someone who is consistently overwhelmed or unable to manage stress, which would suggest a 1. A middle score of 3 seems most accurate, as he is actively working on improving his ability to handle stress but still faces challenges.",

            "BFI-10_1": "Marcus describes himself as a quiet kid who loved reading and drawing, and he often mentions being introspective and thoughtful. While he has close relationships with family and friends, he doesn't seem to seek out large social interactions or express himself in a highly visible or outgoing way. He also mentions not being into politics and not being the type to engage in the 'influencer' culture on social media, which suggests a more reserved nature.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Marcus Johnson shows a strong sense of connection and community in his life.

            "BFI-10_4": "Marcus has described experiencing stress and burnout in the past, especially during college and when juggling work, volunteering, and personal projects. He has also mentioned learning to recognize when he is overwhelmed and taking steps to address it, such as going for a run, calling his sister, or journaling. While he has made progress in managing his stress, he still acknowledges moments of feeling overwhelmed and has not fully developed a consistently relaxed or stress-free approach to life.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant mentioned being into comic books and science fiction as a teenager, which suggests some engagement with creative or artistic interests. Additionally, they mentioned reading as a routine and having an interest in building things (e.g., software development, personal projects). While they may not identify as an artist, they do have some artistic or creative inclinations, which would place them somewhere in the middle of the range. However, since the question is about 'few artistic interests,' and the participant doesn’t explicitly mention any strong artistic hobbies or pursuits, they are more likely to lean toward the lower end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Marcus describes himself as someone who has been focused on his studies and career, and while he has close family and a few close friends, he doesn't seem to be particularly focused on being outgoing or sociable in a broad sense.

While he has made progress, he still acknowledges moments of feeling overwhelmed, particularly when juggling multiple responsibilities. This suggests he is not entirely free of nervousness but has developed coping strategies, placing him somewhere in the middle of the range.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Marcus Johnson mentioned growing up as a 'quiet kid, always reading books or drawing' and being 'into comic books and science fiction' as a teenager. He also described his interest in 'building things' and 'problem-solving' in his current job, which suggests a blend of creativity and practicality.
