Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMarcus Johnson: Well, I was born in Des Moines, Iowa, and I've lived here most of my life. My parents were both working-class folks who didn't have a lot of money, but they always made sure I had the basics. My dad worked at a local factory, and my mom was a nurse's aide. We lived in a small apartment, but I never felt like I was missing out. I was a pretty quiet kid, always reading books or drawing. I remember being really into comic books and science fiction as a teenager, which probably explains why I ended up going to college for something like computer science. I got my bachelor's degree from a state school, which was tough because I had to work part-time to help pay for it. I'm still figuring out what I want to do with my degree, but I know I want to make sure I'm not stuck in the same cycle my parents were in. I'm not really into politics, but I do care about things like fair wages and education access. I've never been married, and I don't really see myself getting married anytime soon. I'm focused on building a stable life for myself, and maybe one day starting my own business.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMarcus Johnson: Yeah, there was definitely a crossroads. I was about 20, right after I started college, and I had this job at a local tech store. I was working 20 hours a week, going to classes, and trying to keep up with my studies. One day, my manager offered me a promotion to a full-time position with better hours and benefits. It would have been a stable job, good pay, and I wouldn't have had to worry about money as much. But I remember sitting there, thinking about my parents and how they had always worked hard but never really had the chance to move up. I didn't want to end up in the same place they were. So I turned down the promotion. It was tough, because I needed the money, but I knew if I stayed in school, I could build something better for myself. That decision probably made me who I am today \u2014 someone who's not afraid to take the harder path if it means having more control over my future.\n\n",

I remember talking to my mom about it, and she just said, 'You're not going to be happy if you settle for less.' That stuck with me. I didn't want to be one of those people who looked back and wondered what could have been. So I made the decision to stay in school, even though it meant more stress and less money. Looking back, I don't regret it. It was the right call for me, even if it wasn't the easiest one.\n\n",

I remember my mom worked second shift at the hospital, and she never had time to really help me navigate the college application process or the financial aid stuff. I wish there had been someone at the school or in the community who could have sat down with me and explained my options. I know a lot of people don't have the same resources or support systems, so I think organizations that provide mentorship or financial guidance to students from low-income backgrounds could make a huge difference.

My family is still pretty close, though. My parents are both retired now, and they live in the same neighborhood I grew up in. My mom still works part-time at the hospital, and my dad spends a lot of time gardening and fixing things around the house. I try to visit them as much as I can, even if it's just for dinner on the weekends. They've always been supportive of me, even when I was making tough decisions like turning down that job offer.

The crossroads moment I described, turning down that job offer, was a defining point in my life. It wasn't an easy decision, but it was the right one for me, and I'm proud of the person I've become because of it. I also realized how much I wish I had more guidance when I was in college \u2014 it's something I want to give back to others now.

She's a few years older than me, and she was always the more outgoing one of us. While I was into books and video games, she was the one who got us into music and going to local events. She worked in marketing for a while but eventually went back to school and became a social worker. She's really passionate about helping people, especially kids from tough backgrounds. We don't talk as often as I'd like, but when we do, it's always good. I admire her for the path she's taken, and I think she's been a big influence on me, even if I didn't realize it at the time.

One of them is Jamal, who I met in college. We both had similar backgrounds \u2014 working-class families, first-generation college students trying to figure out our paths. We bonded over our shared struggles and ended up rooming together for a couple of years. Even though we went different ways after graduation \u2014 he ended up in the military, and I stayed in the tech field \u2014 we still keep in touch. He's been a good influence on me, especially when it came to making tough decisions. There's also Sarah, who I met through a community center program. She's a teacher now, and she's always been the one to push me to think bigger, to not settle for the easy path. I don't know if I'd have made it through college without people like her in my life.

It's a mix of older homes and newer apartments, mostly family-oriented. There's a community center nearby that hosts a lot of events, from job fairs to youth programs, and I've been volunteering there a bit when I can. It's a good reminder of where I came from and how much I want to give back. The area isn't perfect \u2014 there are some issues with gentrification and rising rents \u2014 but there's also a strong sense of community.

I've never had any real issues, and I think that's because there's a sense of mutual respect. That said, I do notice some changes \u2014 especially with the younger generation coming in, some of them not knowing the history of the place or the struggles that people like my parents went through.

I've been lucky to have friends and mentors who've helped me through tough times, and I think that's something that's really unique to this place. But there are definitely downs too. The cost of living has gone up a lot in the past few years, and I've had to make some tough choices about where to live and how to budget. I used to rent a small apartment not too far from campus, but when the rent got too high, I had to move in with my parents for a while. It wasn't ideal \u2014 I was used to being more independent \u2014 but it reminded me of where I came from and how much I've grown. I think the biggest challenge is balancing the comfort of home with the need to push myself forward.

It's those little habits that keep me grounded. But what makes it hard is the constant juggling act. When I'm working long hours, volunteering, and trying to keep up with personal projects, it's easy to skip a workout or grab fast food instead of cooking something healthy.

I've been really proud of myself for sticking to my goals, like finishing that online course in data analysis and starting to take my side projects more seriously. It's been rewarding to see the skills I've been building come together, and I feel like I'm finally in a place where I can start thinking about the future in a more concrete way. That said, there have been moments where I've felt overwhelmed, especially when I'm juggling work, volunteering, and trying to keep up with my personal goals. I've had to learn how to say no to some things and prioritize what really matters. I've also been reflecting a lot on where I came from \u2014 how far I've come, but also how much I still have to work on. I think the biggest thing I've been feeling is gratitude. Gratitude for the people who have supported me, for the opportunities I've had, and for the chance to build a better life for myself. It's not always easy, but I'm trying to stay focused on the positive and keep moving forward.\n\n",

How about for you?\n\nMarcus Johnson: I think I've dealt with anxiety in the past, especially during college when everything felt so uncertain. There were times when I would lie awake at night, worrying about money, my future, and whether I was making the right choices. I didn't want to let my parents down, and I was scared of ending up in the same situation they were in. It wasn't clinical depression, but it felt like a heavy weight on my chest most of the time. I started seeing a counselor a few years back, and that really helped me understand what I was going through. I learned how to recognize the signs and take steps to manage it \u2014 like talking to someone, journaling, or just taking a walk when things got too much. I still have days when I feel overwhelmed, especially when I'm juggling a lot of responsibilities, but I've gotten better at handling it. I don't want to minimize what others go through, but I think having that support system \u2014 whether it's friends, family, or professionals \u2014 makes all the difference.

They've always believed in me, even when I wasn't sure I believed in myself.

She worries about me pushing too hard, not taking enough time to rest. I can see it in her eyes when we talk, and I know she's thinking about how she and my dad had to work so hard just to get by. It's not easy for them to watch their kid struggle with the same pressures, even if I'm in a better position now. I try to reassure them that I'm okay, but I also know I need to be more open about how I'm feeling \u2014 about the stress, the uncertainty, the moments when I feel like I'm not doing enough.

When I was 16, I was raised in a Protestant household, and church was a regular part of our lives. My parents believed in it, and I went along with it, but I never really connected with it on a personal level. Over time, as I got older and started thinking more about who I was and what I believed in, I drifted away from organized religion. I don't feel like I need a higher power to guide me \u2014 I prefer to look inward, to my values, my family, and the people who have supported me along the way. That said, I do think about the importance of community and helping others, which I guess is a kind of spiritual belief in its own way. I don't go to church anymore, but I still find meaning in the connections I have with others and the work I do to give back. It's not the same as what I had growing up, but I think it's a different kind of faith \u2014 one that's rooted in action and relationships rather than doctrine.\n\n",

I don't use Instagram much \u2014 I find it a bit too focused on appearances, and honestly, I don't have the time or energy to curate a perfect online image.

But I'm not really into the whole 'influencer' culture or the constant comparison that comes with platforms like TikTok or Twitter.

The biggest shift for me has been learning how to recognize when I'm getting overwhelmed and taking steps to address it before it spirals. I used to push through everything, thinking that if I just worked harder, I could handle it all. But I've started to realize that burnout isn't something you can just power through. Now, when I feel the weight of too many responsibilities, I take a step back. I might go for a run, call my sister, or even just sit in silence for a while and let my thoughts settle.

For example, during the winter, my heating bill went up a bit, which I didn't really anticipate. I had to adjust my budget to cover that, which meant cutting back on some of my streaming subscriptions and eating out less. Then there was the holiday season \u2014 I ended up spending more than I expected on gifts for my parents and sister, even though I tried to keep it simple.

Now, I've learned to recognize the signs and take steps to address them \u2014 whether it's going for a run, calling my sister, or just taking a moment to breathe. I also realized how important it is to have a support system \u2014 not just for emotional reasons, but for practical ones too, like managing my finances and making sure I'm not overspending. It's not always easy to stay on top of everything, but I'm learning that balance is key. I'm grateful for the progress I've made, even if there's still a long way to go.",

That's mostly from my full-time job as a software developer, and a little bit from the freelance work I've been doing on the side. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover my expenses and save a little for the future. I know it's more than my parents ever made at my age, and that's something I'm really grateful for. I've been trying to be careful with my money, not just because I want to save for a house someday, but also because I know how tight things can get if you're not prepared. It's strange, really \u2014 I used to worry so much about not having enough, but now I'm starting to feel like I have a little more control over my financial future. I just hope I can keep it up and make sure I'm not repeating the same struggles my parents had.\n\n",

The company offers a solid benefits package \u2014 health insurance, dental, vision, and a decent amount of paid time off. I get about 15 days of vacation a year, plus sick days and holidays. It's not the most generous package I've heard of, but it's enough to cover my needs. One of the things I really appreciate is the flexibility \u2014 they allow remote work a few days a week, which is helpful when I need to focus on personal projects or volunteer work. The culture is pretty collaborative, and I feel like my contributions are valued. I know not everyone has the same opportunities, especially in places like Des Moines, where tech jobs aren't as common. I'm grateful for the stability and the chance to grow within the company, even if it's not the most glamorous job. It's just another step toward building the life I want \u2014 one where I can support myself and eventually give back to the community that helped me get here.\n\n",

My manager, Karen, is someone I really respect. She's been in the industry for a while, and she's always willing to listen when I have questions or need guidance. She's not one of those bosses who just wants results \u2014 she actually cares about her team and wants us to grow. That makes a big difference, especially when you're trying to balance work with everything else in your life. As for my coworkers, most of them are pretty friendly and collaborative. We work on different projects, but there's a sense of camaraderie \u2014 we'll grab lunch together or chat about things outside of work. I think it helps that we all come from similar backgrounds \u2014 a lot of us are first-generation college graduates or people who had to work their way up. It creates a kind of mutual understanding, even if we don't always agree on everything. I wouldn't say it's perfect \u2014 there are definitely times when things get tense or when priorities clash \u2014 but for the most part, I feel supported and valued at work, which is something I didn't take for granted growing up.\n\n",

The company allows remote work a couple of days a week, which is helpful when I need to focus on personal projects or volunteer work. That said, there are times when the schedule can be less predictable \u2014 especially when we're launching a new feature or dealing with a tight deadline. I've learned to be flexible with my time, but I also make sure to set boundaries so I don't end up working all the time. It's a balance, and I think that's something I've had to work on since I was younger, when I was used to juggling school, work, and family responsibilities all at once.

He was one of the assembly line workers, putting together parts for tractors and harvesters. It wasn't the kind of job that required a lot of education, but it did require a lot of physical strength and attention to detail. My mom worked at Des Moines General Hospital, which was a pretty busy place back then. She was part of the support staff, helping nurses with patients, making sure they had clean clothes, and assisting with basic care. She didn't get a lot of time off, and she never really had the chance to move up in the hospital's hierarchy.

My mom, on the other hand, always said she was doing something that mattered, even if it was just helping someone feel a little better for a day.
