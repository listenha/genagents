Based on my personal experiences, I’ve found that most horror movies fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum—they are intended to scare but are also crafted to be enjoyable. A truly great horror movie can be thrilling and immersive without being overwhelming. I don’t think a horror movie would ever be so boring that it leads to boredom to death, but it could be scary enough to leave a lasting impression. I place it closer to the middle, leaning slightly toward the 'scared to death' end because of the genre's primary purpose."

My personal experiences with unexpected challenges—like work-related issues or family situations—have often felt arbitrary, aligning more with the idea of randomness. However, I also recognize that many of these issues have underlying causes. Still, the essence of Murphy's Law feels more aligned with the unpredictable, chaotic nature of life rather than a deterministic system."

In my culture, drinking alcohol is not common, and when it does happen, it's often in a more reserved or formal setting. However, in social situations where it's done in moderation and with friends, it can feel cool and relaxed. I’ve seen moments where drinking has felt awkward or forced, especially in mixed company or when it's not aligned with personal values.

However, it is not something that would typically be considered entertaining in a traditional sense.

While it suggests being in a new city, the imagery of candlelight often carries a sense of warmth and familiarity, which could hint at a longing for home. However, it doesn’t strongly suggest homesickness, as it could also represent a moment of comfort or peace in a new environment. My personal experience of moving to the U.S. as a child and finding a balance between my Indian heritage and my life here makes me see this clue as leaning slightly toward homesickness, but not entirely. It feels like a moment of reflection rather than a strong emotional pull toward home."

While it is not particularly 'zesty' in the sense of being spicy or tangy, it does have a distinct flavor profile that sets it apart from completely bland beverages. However, it lacks the boldness or intensity that would place it on the extreme 'zesty' end of the spectrum. Based on my personal experience with Diet Coke, I would place it somewhere in the middle to slightly more on the bland side, as it is not overly stimulating or intense in flavor."
