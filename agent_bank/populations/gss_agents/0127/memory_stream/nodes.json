Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nJessica Bennett: I was born in a small town in Alabama, and I grew up in a tight-knit community where everyone knew each other. My parents worked hard to make ends meet, and while we didn't have a lot of money, they always made sure I had the basics and encouraged me to dream big. My mom had a bachelor's degree and worked as a teacher, which inspired me to value education, even though my dad only had an associate degree. We moved from one town to another when I was a teenager, but I always felt connected to the South. I was raised Protestant, but I've become more secular as I've grown older. I went to college on a scholarship, earned my bachelor's degree in social work, and now I work full-time helping others in my community. It's not always easy, but I believe in making a difference, even if I don't have a lot of wealth or resources.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nJessica Bennett: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped my path. When I was 17, I had the chance to either stay in the same small town and take a job at the local community center or move to a bigger city to attend a university that offered a full scholarship. My parents were hesitant because we were already struggling financially, and moving away would mean leaving the only home I'd ever known. But I remember sitting on the porch one evening, watching the sunset, and realizing that if I didn't take this chance, I might always feel like I was standing still. I chose to leave, and that decision led me to pursue my degree in social work. It wasn't easy\u2014there were times I missed home and felt overwhelmed by the pace of city life\u2014but it also opened my eyes to the struggles of people from all walks of life. That experience taught me the importance of resilience and the power of education, and it's what ultimately led me to the work I do now, helping others navigate their own crossroads.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nJessica Bennett: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made lightly. I had to weigh so many things\u2014my family's support, my own fears, and the opportunities in front of me. I remember talking to my mom for hours, crying, and then finally saying, 'I need to try.' It wasn't just about the scholarship or the degree; it was about not letting my circumstances define my future. I wanted to show myself, and maybe even my community, that even if you come from a place with limited resources, you can still build something meaningful. I didn't just 'fall into' this path\u2014it was a decision I made with my whole heart, even if it was scary.\n\n",

My mom was my biggest supporter, but there were also a few teachers at my high school who saw potential in me that I didn't always see in myself. One of them, Ms. Thompson, actually wrote a letter of recommendation for me when I applied to the scholarship program. She didn't just say I was a good student\u2014she said I had a heart for helping others, and that meant a lot to me. I also remember talking to a counselor at the community center who had once been in a similar situation. She told me that sometimes the hardest part isn't making the choice, but believing you're ready for it. Her words stuck with me. So while I made the decision myself, I don't think I would have had the courage to take that step without the encouragement and belief of others.\n\n",

My mom and dad are both still in Alabama, and even though we're not in the same city, we talk often. My mom still teaches, and she's been so proud of me ever since I graduated. My dad works at a local factory, and while he doesn't always say much, I know he's been there for me in his own way. I also have a younger sister who's just starting college, and I try to be a mentor to her, just like some of my teachers were to me. I think family is about more than just blood\u2014it's about the people who believe in you, even when you're not sure you believe in yourself. Right now, I'm focused on my work, but I know that one day, I'd like to have a family of my own, maybe even start a nonprofit to help kids from similar backgrounds have the same opportunities I did.\n\n",

My maternal grandparents live in the same town where I grew up, and even though they're getting older, they still visit us whenever they can. My grandma, in particular, has always been a source of wisdom for me. She used to say that life is like a quilt\u2014made up of different pieces, but when you put them together, they tell a story. I think about that a lot, especially when I'm working with clients who are trying to piece their lives back together. On my dad's side, my grandfather passed away a few years ago, but my uncle is still around, and we have a good relationship. He works in construction, and while our paths are different, he's always been there to offer advice or a helping hand when I needed it.

One of them is my best friend, Alex, who I met in college. We bonded over our shared passion for social justice and helping others. He's the kind of person who always challenges me to think deeper and push harder, even when I'm not sure I can. We've been through a lot together\u2014late-night study sessions, volunteering at shelters, and even some tough moments when I doubted myself. He's like a brother to me, and I don't know where I'd be without him. Then there's my supervisor at work, Ms. Rivera, who took me under her wing when I first started. She's been a huge influence on me, not just professionally but personally. She taught me that leadership isn't about being in charge\u2014it's about lifting others up. I also have a few close friends from my community center days who I still keep in touch with. They remind me of where I came from and why I do the work I do.

My apartment is in a building that's been around for a while, but it's been nicely renovated.

I know not everyone feels safe in their neighborhood, and I try to be aware of that, but for me, this place has become a home.

I usually start my week on Monday with a morning routine\u2014coffee, a quick walk around the neighborhood to clear my head, and then heading into the office. My job as a social worker is pretty demanding, so I often have meetings with clients, case management, and administrative tasks.

I've learned that asking for help isn't a sign of weakness\u2014it's a sign of strength. I've also had to be more flexible with myself, understanding that some days I'll be more productive than others. It's not always easy, but I've come to see that my health is just as important as the work I do. If I don't take care of myself, I can't be there for the people who need me most.\n\n",

On one hand, I feel more confident in my work and in who I am as a person. I've started to take more leadership roles at the nonprofit I work for, which has been both exciting and terrifying. I've also been more open about my mental health, which has helped me connect with others in a deeper way. But there have been tough moments too. I've had to confront some of the financial struggles I've always been aware of, like the pressure of rent and the fact that I'm still working my way up in my career. I've also been dealing with the weight of wanting to support my sister through college while still trying to build my own path. There were times when I felt like I was juggling too many things at once, and I had to remind myself that it's okay to slow down and take a breath. But overall, I feel like I'm moving forward, even if it's not always in a straight line. I've learned to be more compassionate with myself, and that's something I'm really proud of.\n\n",

There were times when I felt like I was constantly on edge, worrying about everything from my job to my family to the future.

She doesn't say it out loud, but I can tell she's proud of me for the work I'm doing, even if it's not the traditional path she might have imagined for me.

Church was a place of comfort, community, and structure, especially when things felt uncertain. But as I got older, I started questioning a lot of the beliefs I was raised with. It wasn't that I stopped caring about morality or meaning; it was more about finding my own way to understand the world. I think I was always more of a thinker than a follower, and that led me to where I am now. These days, I don't identify with any particular religion, but I still find value in spirituality in a more personal, secular way. I believe in the power of human connection, in the importance of kindness, and in the idea that we all have the capacity to grow and change. I also find peace in nature, in moments of stillness, and in the small, everyday acts of compassion. I don't think of it as religion, but I do think of it as something that guides me\u2014just in a different way than I was raised to see it.\n\n",

I've found that it can be both a connection and a distraction, and I've had to be careful about how much time I spend on it. I do use Facebook occasionally to stay in touch with family back in Alabama, especially my mom and sister. It's nice to see their updates, share photos of my work, or just send a quick message to let them know I'm thinking of them. I used to be more active on Instagram, but I found that it often made me feel worse about myself\u2014comparing my life to others' highlight reels. I've since scaled back, and I prefer using it more for professional purposes, like sharing resources or events related to social work.

In the winter, my heating bill went up a bit, which was a challenge because I was already stretching my budget thin. I remember one month when I had to choose between paying the full heating bill or cutting back on groceries, and I ended up doing both\u2014buying cheaper groceries and turning the heat down a few degrees. It wasn't ideal, but I had to make it work. Then, in the spring, I had to pay for my car's maintenance, which I hadn't budgeted for, and that threw me off a little. I also had to pay for some unexpected expenses related to my sister's college, like a textbook she needed for a class. I didn't have much savings, so I had to take on an extra weekend shift at the community center to cover it.

That usually takes up a few hours a week, sometimes more depending on the needs of the organization. I also take on weekend shifts at the community center where I used to volunteer, especially during busy times like back-to-school or holiday events. It's not always easy juggling everything, but I've learned to be really efficient with my time. I also do some freelance writing on the side\u2014mostly for local nonprofits or blogs that focus on social justice issues. It's not a steady income, but it helps supplement my earnings and keeps me engaged with the causes I care about. I think having multiple jobs has taught me a lot about time management, resilience, and the value of hard work. It's not always glamorous, but I know that every hour I put in is helping someone else, and that gives me a sense of purpose.\n\n",

Talking about my stress, worry, and coping strategies reminded me of how far I've come in learning to prioritize my mental health, even when it's hard. It also made me realize how much I've grown in being open about my struggles, not just with my therapist or my coworkers, but with myself. Describing my anxiety and how it's affected my work and personal life made me feel less alone, like there are others who struggle in similar ways. It also made me appreciate the support I've received from my family, especially my mom and dad, who have always been there, even when I didn't ask for it. I've learned that healing isn't linear, and that's okay. It's not about being perfect\u2014it's about showing up, day by day, and doing the work to take care of myself so I can be there for others too. At the same time, reflecting on my financial situation and how I manage my budget reminded me of the resilience I've built over the years. It's not always easy to make ends meet, but I've learned to be resourceful, to make the most of what I have, and to find joy in the small things. I'm proud of how I've managed to keep things afloat, even with so little, and I know that every step I take\u2014whether it's in my mental health or my financial stability\u2014is part of a larger journey toward growth and self-compassion.",

That comes from my full-time job as a social worker and the part-time consulting I do with the community outreach program. I also earned a little extra from the freelance writing I do on the side, though it's not consistent. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover my rent, groceries, and the other essentials. I know it's not much compared to what some people make, but I'm proud of how I've managed to keep things going, especially with helping my sister through college. I try not to focus too much on the numbers, because I know that money isn't everything\u2014it's about what you do with it and how you support the people around you.

The benefits of the job are pretty standard for a nonprofit\u2014health insurance is the biggest one, though it's not the most comprehensive, and I have to be careful with my premiums. We get a certain number of paid days off each year, which is good, but I don't always take them because I feel like I need to be there for my clients. I also have sick time, which is something I've come to appreciate, especially with how much I've been prioritizing my mental health lately. The workplace itself is pretty supportive, and I feel like I'm part of a team that genuinely cares about the people we serve. There's a lot of collaboration, and I've learned so much from my coworkers, even if the pay isn't great. I think the most important benefit, though, is the sense of purpose that comes with this work.

My manager, Ms. Rivera, has been a huge influence on me. She's not just a boss; she's like a mentor. She's always pushing me to think bigger, to take on more responsibility, and to be a leader in my own right. I used to be really shy about speaking up in meetings or sharing my ideas, but she encouraged me to find my voice, and now I feel more confident in my role. As for my coworkers, we have a really strong sense of camaraderie. We're all in this together, working with people who are often in crisis, and that creates a bond that's hard to explain. We look out for each other, whether it's covering for someone who's having a rough day or just offering a listening ear when things get overwhelming.

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nJessica Bennett: My work schedule is pretty flexible, but it's also pretty unpredictable at times. I have a core set of hours from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., but I often end up working late or coming in early depending on the needs of my clients. Some days, I might leave right at 5, and other days, I'm still at the office well past 7 or 8 p.m. I also take on weekend shifts at the community center, which can add another 10 to 15 hours every few weeks. The flexibility is both a blessing and a challenge. On one hand, it allows me to be there for people when they need me most, even if it means adjusting my personal time. On the other hand, it can make it hard to maintain a strict routine or have consistent time for myself. I've learned to be really adaptable, but there are definitely days when I wish I had more structure. Still, I know that this kind of flexibility is part of what makes this job meaningful\u2014it means I can show up for others, even when it's not convenient for me.\n\n",
