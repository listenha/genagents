I don't think a horror movie would ever be so boring that it leads to 'bored to death,' as the genre inherently aims to engage the viewer with tension and suspense. That said, some horror movies may not be as scary as others, so I would place it somewhere in the middle of the spectrum."

From a scientific perspective, their rise and fall were not part of a linear, progressive path of civilization, but rather a series of evolutionary and environmental changes that were largely unpredictable. My personal understanding of history and science leans toward the idea that many events in history, including the dominance and extinction of dinosaurs, are the result of complex, random processes rather than a steady improvement.

However, I’ve also seen it be cool when it’s done responsibly, in a way that feels natural and part of a social experience. Given that I value authenticity and connection, I see drinking more as a neutral or situational activity rather than inherently cringe or cool.
