She also mentions being a mentor to her sister and being open with her coworkers and clients. These behaviors suggest she is not particularly reserved and is more inclined to express herself and engage with others.",

She often mentions the support she received from her mother, teachers, and mentors, and she values connection and community. Her work as a social worker also requires a high degree of trust in her clients and colleagues. These factors suggest she is generally trusting of others.",

Instead, she appears to be someone who is driven, responsible, and constantly working toward her goals.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Jessica has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety and stress, particularly in the past year. She has described feeling overwhelmed at times, needing to take breaks, and learning to manage her mental health through therapy and mindfulness. While she has made progress in handling stress, she has not portrayed herself as consistently relaxed or stress-free. Her self-awareness and honesty about her challenges suggest she would not rate herself a 5, but she also wouldn't rate herself a 1, as she has actively worked to improve her coping strategies.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Throughout the interview, Jessica did not mention any artistic interests or activities. Her focus was on social work, community involvement, and personal growth. She described her life in practical, goal-oriented terms and did not reference art, music, or creative hobbies. This suggests she does not see herself as someone with strong artistic interests.",

She mentions having a close-knit group of friends, mentors, and coworkers, and she often emphasizes the importance of community and support systems.

She consistently reflects on the importance of understanding, helping, and lifting others up, rather than criticizing or finding fault. Her work as a social worker, her focus on community, and her emphasis on gratitude and connection all suggest she is more likely to be understanding and less likely to find fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Jessica describes her work as a social worker with a strong sense of responsibility and dedication. She often mentions being present for her clients, taking on extra shifts, and making sure she is doing what is needed for those she helps. She also reflects on her growth in being more intentional and mindful in her work and personal life. These traits suggest she values thoroughness and takes pride in her work.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Jessica has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, particularly in the past few years. She described feeling constantly on edge, worrying about her job, family, and future. She also mentioned that she used to push through her anxiety without addressing it, which suggests she has experienced it as a significant part of her life. While she has made progress in managing it, the interview indicates that she still experiences anxiety and has had to confront it actively.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Jessica Bennett discusses her work in social work, her personal growth, and her aspirations, but there is no explicit mention of her imagination or creative thinking. While she reflects on her life and goals, her narrative is grounded in practical experiences, responsibilities, and real-world challenges. She does not describe herself as someone who engages in imaginative or creative pursuits, which suggests she may lean toward the lower end of the scale."

She often emphasizes the importance of support systems, personal growth, and emotional vulnerability. While she is not shy about discussing her struggles, she also shows a tendency to reflect and process things internally, as seen in her journaling habits and her thoughtful approach to life.

These traits are inconsistent with seeing herself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Jessica has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety and stress, particularly in the past year. She has described feeling overwhelmed at times, needing to take breaks, and learning to prioritize her mental health. While she has made progress in managing her stress through therapy, mindfulness, and support systems, she still acknowledges the challenges and does not always handle stress effortlessly.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Jessica's interview does not mention any artistic interests or activities. She focuses on social work, community outreach, and practical life management.

            "BFI-10_6": "Jessica describes herself as someone who values connection and has strong relationships with her family, friends, and clients. She is involved in her community, works with others, and has a supportive network. However, she also mentions moments of feeling overwhelmed by her workload and the need to balance her personal and professional life. While she is clearly sociable in her professional and familial roles, she does not explicitly describe herself as outgoing or seeking out social interactions for their own sake.

            "BFI-10_9": "Jessica has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, particularly in the past few years, and has described moments where she felt overwhelmed, anxious, and even broke down under the weight of stress. She has acknowledged that she used to push through without taking care of her mental health, but has since learned to recognize and manage her anxiety. While she has made progress, her self-described experiences with anxiety suggest she would not rate herself as a 1, but she also wouldn't rate herself as a 5. She seems to fall somewhere in the middle, acknowledging her struggles but also showing growth and self-awareness.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Jessica Bennett describes herself as someone deeply connected to her community, focused on helping others, and grounded in her experiences. While she reflects on her past and future with thoughtfulness, her narrative emphasizes practical challenges, responsibilities, and real-world actions over imaginative or creative pursuits.
