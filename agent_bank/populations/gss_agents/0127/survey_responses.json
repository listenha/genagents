            "BFI-10_1": "Jessica Bennett describes herself as someone who has been open about her mental health struggles, has close relationships with friends and family, and is actively involved in her community. She also mentions being a mentor to her sister and being open with her coworkers and clients. These behaviors suggest she is not particularly reserved and is more inclined to express herself and engage with others.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Jessica has shown a strong sense of connection and trust in her relationships, especially with her family, friends, and clients. She often mentions the support she received from her mother, teachers, and mentors, and she values connection and community. Her work as a social worker also requires a high degree of trust in her clients and colleagues. These factors suggest she is generally trusting of others.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Jessica Bennett describes herself as someone who works full-time, takes on part-time and weekend jobs, helps her sister with college, and actively engages in her community. She also reflects on her personal growth, her commitment to her work, and her efforts to maintain her mental and physical health. These behaviors are inconsistent with seeing herself as lazy. Instead, she appears to be someone who is driven, responsible, and constantly working toward her goals.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Jessica has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety and stress, particularly in the past year. She has described feeling overwhelmed at times, needing to take breaks, and learning to manage her mental health through therapy and mindfulness. While she has made progress in handling stress, she has not portrayed herself as consistently relaxed or stress-free. Her self-awareness and honesty about her challenges suggest she would not rate herself a 5, but she also wouldn't rate herself a 1, as she has actively worked to improve her coping strategies.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Throughout the interview, Jessica did not mention any artistic interests or activities. Her focus was on social work, community involvement, and personal growth. She described her life in practical, goal-oriented terms and did not reference art, music, or creative hobbies. This suggests she does not see herself as someone with strong artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Jessica describes herself as someone who values connection with others, particularly through her work with clients, her relationships with family, and her friendships. She mentions having a close-knit group of friends, mentors, and coworkers, and she often emphasizes the importance of community and support systems. While she doesn't explicitly describe herself as outgoing or sociable, her actions and values strongly suggest that she is comfortable engaging with others and forming meaningful relationships.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Jessica Bennett demonstrates a strong sense of empathy, compassion, and support for others throughout the interview. She consistently reflects on the importance of understanding, helping, and lifting others up, rather than criticizing or finding fault. Her work as a social worker, her focus on community, and her emphasis on gratitude and connection all suggest she is more likely to be understanding and less likely to find fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Jessica describes her work as a social worker with a strong sense of responsibility and dedication. She often mentions being present for her clients, taking on extra shifts, and making sure she is doing what is needed for those she helps. She also reflects on her growth in being more intentional and mindful in her work and personal life. These traits suggest she values thoroughness and takes pride in her work.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Jessica has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, particularly in the past few years. She described feeling constantly on edge, worrying about her job, family, and future. She also mentioned that she used to push through her anxiety without addressing it, which suggests she has experienced it as a significant part of her life. While she has made progress in managing it, the interview indicates that she still experiences anxiety and has had to confront it actively.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Jessica Bennett discusses her work in social work, her personal growth, and her aspirations, but there is no explicit mention of her imagination or creative thinking. While she reflects on her life and goals, her narrative is grounded in practical experiences, responsibilities, and real-world challenges. She does not describe herself as someone who engages in imaginative or creative pursuits, which suggests she may lean toward the lower end of the scale."

            "BES-A_6": "Jessica describes herself as someone who values connection and is deeply empathetic, often working with people in challenging situations. She is reflective, kind, and supportive, which suggests she is likely to be more attuned to others' moods and able to work effectively with people regardless of their cheerfulness.
