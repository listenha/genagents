            "BFI-10_1": "Antonio Alvarez describes himself as someone who values close relationships with family and friends, but he also mentions that he is more of a quiet observer on social media and prefers to talk things out with people he knows in person. He doesn't appear to be overly expressive or socially dominant, but he is not entirely closed off either. He has a strong sense of self and is reflective, which suggests a moderate level of reserve.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Antonio Alvarez shows a strong sense of community and gratitude toward the people in his life, including his family, friends, and the community center that supported him. He mentions feeling safe in his neighborhood, values relationships, and has expressed trust in his coworkers and manager.

He reflects on his struggles, takes initiative in his job, and makes an effort to stay healthy and connected with others. These traits suggest he does not see himself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Antonio mentions experiencing anxiety, especially when feeling overwhelmed by work or uncertain about his future. He also describes having to slow down and rethink how he manages his time and energy after dealing with back pain. While he has developed some coping strategies, such as journaling, running, and talking to friends, he also acknowledges that he still has days when anxiety creeps in. This suggests that while he is making progress, he does not yet see himself as someone who consistently handles stress well.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Antonio mentions that he used to play the guitar when he was younger and has recently started practicing again, which indicates some level of interest in music.

            "BFI-10_6": "Antonio describes himself as someone who values relationships with family and friends, and he maintains connections with his sister, coworkers, and community. However, he also mentions that he is not overly active on social media and prefers quiet, personal interactions over large social gatherings. He seems to value close, meaningful relationships but does not describe himself as someone who actively seeks out new social situations or enjoys being the center of attention.",

            "BFI-10_8": "Antonio has described his work ethic as strong, showing up consistently and doing his best at his part-time job. He has also reflected on the importance of education and learning from his parents, who were both hardworking and dedicated to their roles. While he may not have a high-paying or prestigious job, he approaches his work with a sense of responsibility and has taken steps to improve his life, such as staying active and managing his time. These traits suggest he sees himself as someone who does a thorough job, even if not in a high-stakes environment.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Antonio has mentioned experiencing anxiety, particularly when feeling overwhelmed by work or uncertain about his future. He also described moments of stress and worry, such as when he had to take time off work due to back pain or when he felt stuck in his current situation. However, he has also shown resilience and has developed coping strategies like journaling, running, and talking to friends. While he does experience anxiety, it doesn't seem to be a constant or overwhelming part of his life, suggesting he would not rate himself as extremely nervous.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Antonio Alvarez's interview reflects a person who is grounded in his experiences, focused on practical matters like work, family, and financial stability. While he has moments of reflection and personal growth, there is no indication that he engages in imaginative or creative thinking as a defining trait. He is more focused on the realities of his life, such as his job, family responsibilities, and financial struggles, rather than on abstract or imaginative pursuits."

He talks about the importance of family, the support he has received from friends and community, and how he values kindness and relationships.

He has taken on leadership roles in his life, such as making important decisions about his education and helping his family.

He often reflects on the emotional support he has received from others and emphasizes the importance of being present for those he loves.

However, he also notes that it's sometimes hard to stay consistent due to stress, work, and financial responsibilities.

He is reflective, thoughtful, and values deep connections, which suggests he may not be overly expressive or attention-seeking. However, he is not entirely closed off—he has close friends, engages in community activities, and is open about his struggles. This suggests he is neither extremely reserved nor extremely outgoing, but more on the middle ground.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Antonio Alvarez has expressed a strong sense of community and support from his family, friends, and the neighborhood. He has spoken positively about people who have helped him, such as his mother, his friends, and the community center.

            "BFI-10_4": "Antonio mentions experiencing anxiety, especially around work and future uncertainty, and has had to learn coping strategies like journaling, running, and talking to friends. While he has made progress in managing stress, he also acknowledges that it is still a challenge for him, and he doesn't always handle it well. This suggests he would not rate himself as a 5, but he also doesn't seem to be completely overwhelmed, so a 1 is unlikely. A middle score of 3 seems most accurate.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant mentioned having a few hobbies, such as running and playing the guitar, and reconnecting with his heritage through cooking. While he has some artistic interests (like playing guitar), he does not emphasize them as a central part of his identity. He also described his life as being more focused on work, family, and community responsibilities, which aligns with someone who might see themselves as having fewer artistic interests.",

His personality seems more introspective and grounded, which aligns more with a middle or lower score on this scale.",

He takes his responsibilities seriously at work, and he reflects on the importance of hard work and resilience. While he may not always have the resources or time to do everything perfectly, he consistently strives to do his best and has a clear sense of responsibility. This suggests he would rate himself as someone who does a thorough job, even if not always with perfect results.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Antonio Alvarez mentioned experiencing anxiety, particularly when feeling overwhelmed by work or uncertain about his future. He also described having moments of stress and worry, which aligns with a moderate to high level of nervousness. However, he also described coping strategies like journaling, running, and talking to friends, suggesting he manages his anxiety reasonably well. This places him somewhere in the middle range, but closer to the lower end, as he doesn't describe being constantly or excessively nervous.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Antonio Alvarez describes himself as someone who values structure, hard work, and practicality.
