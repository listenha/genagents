            "BFI-10_1": "Antonio Alvarez describes himself as someone who values close relationships with family and friends, but he also mentions that he is more of a quiet observer on social media and prefers to talk things out with people he knows in person. He doesn't appear to be overly expressive or socially dominant, but he is not entirely closed off either. He has a strong sense of self and is reflective, which suggests a moderate level of reserve.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Antonio Alvarez shows a strong sense of community and gratitude toward the people in his life, including his family, friends, and the community center that supported him. He mentions feeling safe in his neighborhood, values relationships, and has expressed trust in his coworkers and manager.

He reflects on his struggles, takes initiative in his job, and makes an effort to stay healthy and connected with others. These traits suggest he does not see himself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Antonio mentions experiencing anxiety, especially when feeling overwhelmed by work or uncertain about his future. He also describes having to slow down and rethink how he manages his time and energy after dealing with back pain. While he has developed some coping strategies, such as journaling, running, and talking to friends, he also acknowledges that he still has days when anxiety creeps in. This suggests that while he is making progress, he does not yet see himself as someone who consistently handles stress well.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Antonio mentions that he used to play the guitar when he was younger and has recently started practicing again, which indicates some level of interest in music.

            "BFI-10_6": "Antonio describes himself as someone who values relationships with family and friends, and he maintains connections with his sister, coworkers, and community. However, he also mentions that he is not overly active on social media and prefers quiet, personal interactions over large social gatherings. He seems to value close, meaningful relationships but does not describe himself as someone who actively seeks out new social situations or enjoys being the center of attention.",

            "BFI-10_8": "Antonio has described his work ethic as strong, showing up consistently and doing his best at his part-time job. He has also reflected on the importance of education and learning from his parents, who were both hardworking and dedicated to their roles. While he may not have a high-paying or prestigious job, he approaches his work with a sense of responsibility and has taken steps to improve his life, such as staying active and managing his time. These traits suggest he sees himself as someone who does a thorough job, even if not in a high-stakes environment.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Antonio has mentioned experiencing anxiety, particularly when feeling overwhelmed by work or uncertain about his future. He also described moments of stress and worry, such as when he had to take time off work due to back pain or when he felt stuck in his current situation. However, he has also shown resilience and has developed coping strategies like journaling, running, and talking to friends. While he does experience anxiety, it doesn't seem to be a constant or overwhelming part of his life, suggesting he would not rate himself as extremely nervous.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Antonio Alvarez's interview reflects a person who is grounded in his experiences, focused on practical matters like work, family, and financial stability. While he has moments of reflection and personal growth, there is no indication that he engages in imaginative or creative thinking as a defining trait. He is more focused on the realities of his life, such as his job, family responsibilities, and financial struggles, rather than on abstract or imaginative pursuits."

He talks about the importance of family, the support he has received from friends and community, and how he values kindness and relationships.

He has taken on leadership roles in his life, such as making important decisions about his education and helping his family.

He often reflects on the emotional support he has received from others and emphasizes the importance of being present for those he loves.

However, he also notes that it's sometimes hard to stay consistent due to stress, work, and financial responsibilities.

He is reflective, thoughtful, and values deep connections, which suggests he may not be overly expressive or attention-seeking. However, he is not entirely closed off—he has close friends, engages in community activities, and is open about his struggles. This suggests he is neither extremely reserved nor extremely outgoing, but more on the middle ground.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Antonio Alvarez has expressed a strong sense of community and support from his family, friends, and the neighborhood. He has spoken positively about people who have helped him, such as his mother, his friends, and the community center.

            "BFI-10_4": "Antonio mentions experiencing anxiety, especially around work and future uncertainty, and has had to learn coping strategies like journaling, running, and talking to friends. While he has made progress in managing stress, he also acknowledges that it is still a challenge for him, and he doesn't always handle it well. This suggests he would not rate himself as a 5, but he also doesn't seem to be completely overwhelmed, so a 1 is unlikely. A middle score of 3 seems most accurate.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant mentioned having a few hobbies, such as running and playing the guitar, and reconnecting with his heritage through cooking. While he has some artistic interests (like playing guitar), he does not emphasize them as a central part of his identity. He also described his life as being more focused on work, family, and community responsibilities, which aligns with someone who might see themselves as having fewer artistic interests.",

His personality seems more introspective and grounded, which aligns more with a middle or lower score on this scale.",

He takes his responsibilities seriously at work, and he reflects on the importance of hard work and resilience. While he may not always have the resources or time to do everything perfectly, he consistently strives to do his best and has a clear sense of responsibility. This suggests he would rate himself as someone who does a thorough job, even if not always with perfect results.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Antonio Alvarez mentioned experiencing anxiety, particularly when feeling overwhelmed by work or uncertain about his future. He also described having moments of stress and worry, which aligns with a moderate to high level of nervousness. However, he also described coping strategies like journaling, running, and talking to friends, suggesting he manages his anxiety reasonably well. This places him somewhere in the middle range, but closer to the lower end, as he doesn't describe being constantly or excessively nervous.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Antonio Alvarez describes himself as someone who values structure, hard work, and practicality.

He often pauses to consider his responses and shares personal experiences with a sense of humility and care. While he is open and articulate, he doesn't appear to be overly expressive or eager to draw attention to himself.

He mentions the importance of people who have helped him in the past, such as his mother, friends, and the community center. This suggests a general willingness to trust others, as he has relied on the support of others throughout his life. However, he also shows awareness of the challenges and uncertainties in life, which might temper his level of trust. Still, his overall narrative reflects a belief in the value of community and support, which aligns more with a mid-to-high level of trust.",

He has mentioned struggling with back pain and feeling overwhelmed at times, though he has also taken steps to manage his stress, such as running, journaling, and talking to friends.

However, he also states that he hasn't played it in a while and only practices it occasionally. This suggests a mild interest in art (music) but not a strong or central one. He does not mention other artistic pursuits like painting or writing, and his life seems focused on work, family, and community service rather than creative expression. Therefore, he likely falls closer to the lower end of the scale.",

Instead, he appears to approach challenges with a problem-solving mindset, even if he acknowledges the difficulty of his circumstances.",
            "REI_2": "Antonio has demonstrated a strong ability to reflect on his life, make thoughtful decisions, and analyze his experiences during the interview. He discussed his crossroads at 18, the support he received from the community center, and his career and financial planning—all of which require logical analysis. He also shows self-awareness and the ability to evaluate his options and future goals, suggesting he is comfortable with logical reasoning.",

He often reflects on his experiences, emotions, and the support of others, rather than focusing on data or logical analysis. While he does mention making decisions based on values and goals, he doesn’t emphasize analytical thinking or systematic reasoning in his responses.

He also mentions struggling with back pain and the emotional toll of balancing work, family, and personal goals.

He also mentions making conscious decisions based on values and responsibilities, which suggests a degree of logical thinking. However, he doesn’t emphasize analytical or problem-solving skills as a defining trait, and his narrative is more reflective and emotional than purely logical.

He often discusses the motivations behind his actions, such as his mother’s influence, his desire to support his family, and his values of education and service.

While he has some artistic interests (like playing guitar), he does not emphasize them as a major part of his identity or daily life.

He also emphasizes the importance of hard work and learning from his parents, which suggests he values thoroughness.

He also described moments of stress and worry, such as when dealing with financial instability or health issues.

He made a pivotal choice to pursue education despite financial challenges, navigated complex personal and financial situations, and shows an ability to plan and reflect on his future.

He also reflects on his life with clarity and has shown an ability to analyze his experiences and plan for the future.

He has also mentioned struggling with anxiety and feeling overwhelmed at times. While he has shown resilience and the ability to cope, there are clear indications that he does not always feel in control or confident when things are difficult. This suggests he might lean toward agreeing with the statement.",
            "REI_6": "Antonio describes himself as someone who values community, family, and emotional support, and he often reflects on his experiences and feelings when making decisions. While he is thoughtful and reflective, there is no indication that he views himself as particularly strong in logical reasoning.

            "REI_7": "Antonio mentions his education in business administration, his part-time job in retail, and his ability to manage inventory and customer service, which require some level of logical thinking. However, he also emphasizes emotional aspects of his life, such as his family, mental health, and community support, which suggest a more balanced approach between logic and emotion. He does not explicitly describe himself as highly analytical or logical, but he also does not deny it. Given his background and self-description, a middle range score seems most accurate.",

This suggests a balance between logic and intuition, but leans more toward practical, experience-based reasoning rather than strict logic as the primary tool.",

He explains his decisions in detail during the interview, showing a clear understanding of the reasons behind his actions. This suggests he is likely to score higher on this scale."

He also described having moments of stress and worry, which aligns more with a higher score on the scale.
