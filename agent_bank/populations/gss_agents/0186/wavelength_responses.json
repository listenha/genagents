My personal experience with drinking is limited, and I’ve always been cautious about how it’s portrayed in my community.

While there may be a sense of novelty or beauty in the new city, the mention of candlelight often evokes intimacy, warmth, and perhaps a longing for the comfort of home. Based on my experiences of moving through different stages of life and feeling both the excitement of new opportunities and the pull of familiarity, I believe this clue leans more toward homesickness.

I remember receiving notes from my mom when I was in college, or writing notes to my sister to check in on her. These notes were never just words on paper—they were expressions of love, concern, or support. They made me feel seen and cared for. While a note could technically be cold if it was a simple, transactional message (like a reminder or a bill), the emotional resonance of a hand-written note tends to lean toward the warm and fuzzy side. It’s the thought and effort behind it that matters most."
