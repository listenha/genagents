Based on my experiences and perspective, horror movies generally fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. While they aim to scare, they also often include suspense, tension, and entertainment value that can prevent them from being completely boring. However, they are not universally terrifying for everyone, so they are more likely to be on the 'scared to death' side rather than the 'bored to death' side. I’ve seen horror movies that were frightening, but I’ve also seen ones that were less intense and more formulaic, which could lean toward boredom. Still, the primary intent of a horror movie is to scare, so I place it closer to the 'scared to death' end."

Instead, it feels like a peaceful, possibly nostalgic moment that could be experienced in a new place without being tied to a longing for home.
