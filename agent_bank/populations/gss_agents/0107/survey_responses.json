While she is reflective and introspective, she also engages with others, such as her children, husband, friends, and neighbors. She is not described as avoiding social situations or being uncomfortable expressing herself, but rather as someone who is grounded and values meaningful connections.

However, she has also shown growth in learning to slow down, be more present, and find ways to cope, such as journaling and relying on her support system. While she has made progress, she still describes days when she feels overwhelmed, which suggests she would not rate herself as a 5. However, she is not entirely at the lower end of the scale either, as she has developed coping strategies and a sense of self-compassion.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant mentioned enjoying gardening, reading, and journaling, which can be seen as creative or artistic activities.

While she mentions having a few close friends and a supportive neighborhood, she does not describe herself as someone who actively seeks out social events or enjoys being the center of attention.

She talks about managing the household, caring for her children, budgeting, and even volunteering at the community center.

This suggests she sees herself as someone who does a thorough job, even if it is not in a traditional work setting.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Throughout the interview, Erin reflects on her life with a sense of resilience and emotional strength. She acknowledges moments of sadness and stress, particularly after her surgery and during times of self-doubt, but she consistently emphasizes her ability to cope, adapt, and find meaning in her life. She also shows a strong sense of self-awareness and emotional regulation, which suggests she does not see herself as someone who gets nervous easily.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Erin describes her life in a very grounded, practical way. She focuses on her role as a homemaker, her family, and her community. While she reflects on her life and has moments of introspection, there is no indication that she engages in creative or imaginative thinking in the way that would suggest an active imagination.

For example, she reflects on her decisions with clarity and considers the consequences of her choices, such as when she decided to stay home after high school. She also shows a structured approach to managing her household, budgeting, and planning for her family's needs. While she does not explicitly describe herself as logical, her behavior and reasoning suggest she has a logical mind.",
            "REI_8": "Erin often reflects on her life, decisions, and emotions, showing that she is thoughtful and introspective. She discusses her choices, such as staying home to support her family, in a deliberate and reflective manner. She also mentions journaling and taking time to process her feelings, which suggests she values careful thinking.",
            "REI_9": "Erin describes herself as someone who has learned to adapt and find solutions through experience, but she also emphasizes emotional support, community, and personal reflection as key to her growth. While she does show some logical thinking (e.g., budgeting, planning for the family), she does not frame her problem-solving as primarily logical. Instead, she often relies on intuition, emotional intelligence, and the support of others. This suggests she may not strongly identify with using logic as the primary tool for solving problems.",
            "REI_10": "Erin reflects deeply on her decisions, especially in moments of crossroads, such as choosing to stay home with her family instead of pursuing education. She often explains her choices with thoughtful reasoning, such as prioritizing her family’s well-being or acknowledging the trade-offs in her life. This suggests she is intentional and reflective in her decision-making process."

            "BFI-10_1": "Erin describes herself as someone who puts others first, values close relationships, and has a strong sense of community. While she is clearly connected to her family and friends, she also mentions that she doesn't use social media much and prefers in-person interactions. She seems introspective and thoughtful, but not necessarily shy or reserved. Her openness in the interview suggests she is not overly reserved, but she also seems to be reflective and thoughtful, which may align with a middle range.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Erin has expressed a strong sense of community and connection with her family, neighbors, and friends. She mentions feeling safe in her neighborhood, relying on her support system, and valuing the relationships she has built. She also shows trust in her husband, her parents, and her friends, often seeking their support during difficult times. This suggests a general tendency to trust others, even if she has faced challenges in her life.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Erin describes herself as someone who is actively managing her household, caring for her children, and contributing to her community. She emphasizes her daily responsibilities, the time she dedicates to her family, and her efforts to stay healthy and engaged. She does not express any tendency toward laziness or avoidance of effort. Instead, she portrays herself as someone who works hard, even if it's not in a traditional job setting.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Erin has described feeling stressed and overwhelmed at times, particularly after her back surgery and during moments when she felt like she wasn't enough. She also mentioned learning to slow down and be more present, which suggests she is still working on handling stress effectively. While she has made progress, she has not yet fully reached a state of being consistently relaxed or stress-free.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant mentioned gardening, reading, and journaling as activities she engages in, but none of these are explicitly artistic in the traditional sense. She does not mention any involvement in visual arts, music, or creative writing. While she finds joy in the garden and reading, these activities are more practical or reflective than artistic. She also does not express any interest in creative pursuits beyond what is necessary for daily life.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Erin describes herself as someone who values family and community, but she also mentions that she doesn't use social media much and prefers in-person connections. While she is clearly connected to her family and neighbors, she doesn't actively seek out large social circles or engage in social media, which suggests she may lean more toward being introverted or selectively sociable. She seems content with her close-knit relationships rather than being highly outgoing in broader social contexts.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Erin comes across as empathetic, supportive, and focused on the well-being of her family and community. She reflects on her own shortcomings with self-compassion and emphasizes the importance of love, support, and understanding. She does not show signs of being judgmental or critical of others, and instead, she values connection and kindness. Her responses suggest she is more likely to overlook faults in others rather than focus on them.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Erin describes her role as a homemaker and caregiver as requiring a great deal of attention to detail and responsibility. She mentions managing the household, budgeting, helping with homework, and organizing events at the community center. These responsibilities suggest she is thorough in her work, even if it is not in a traditional job setting. Her reflection on her role as a 'full-time job' and the care she puts into her daily tasks supports the idea that she sees herself as someone who does a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Erin describes feeling overwhelmed at times, especially after her back surgery and during moments of self-doubt about her life choices. She also mentions struggling with feelings of not being enough and having moments of sadness. While she has learned to be more self-compassionate and has support from her family and friends, she still acknowledges days when she feels overwhelmed. This suggests she is more prone to nervousness or anxiety than someone who is consistently calm and confident.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Erin describes herself as someone who values the practical aspects of life, such as managing her household, caring for her children, and maintaining a stable routine. While she does engage in activities like gardening and journaling, these are more reflective or purposeful rather than imaginative or creative in a fantasy sense. She does not express a strong inclination toward daydreaming, storytelling, or creative exploration beyond what is necessary for her daily life."
