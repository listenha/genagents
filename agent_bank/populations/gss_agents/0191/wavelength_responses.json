Based on my personal experiences, I find some horror movies to be thrilling and engaging, while others are not as effective.

However, I also find that some horror movies can be over-the-top or cliché, which can make them less impactful.

This leans more toward a feeling of longing or nostalgia, which aligns with homesickness rather than wanderlust.

However, I also recognize that there are patterns and principles that many people across cultures find appealing. This makes me place the clue somewhere in the middle, leaning slightly toward the subjective side because of the emotional and personal connections I've witnessed."
