  "agent_profile_summary": "Emily Murphy, a 26-year-old social worker from Charleston, South Carolina, grew up in a family that valued education and service, shaped by her parents' careers in teaching and nursing. After meeting a homeless woman named Margaret during her undergraduate years, she chose to switch from law to social work, a decision that defined her career path and reinforced her commitment to direct, hands-on support for those in need. Now working full-time at a nonprofit called HopeBridge, she manages cases for families in crisis, balancing long hours with a dedication to mindfulness, reading, and community involvement. Her life is guided by a tension between her desire to help others and the need to care for herself, a balance she continues to refine. Her relationships—with her husband James, her supportive family, and her community—are central to her sense of purpose, and she remains grounded in the belief that small acts of connection can make a meaningful difference."
