            "REI_2": "Emily Murphy describes herself as a social worker who focuses on direct, hands-on support for others, often emphasizing emotional connection, mindfulness, and personal relationships. While she is reflective, empathetic, and values human connection, she does not explicitly mention a strong aptitude for logical analysis or structured problem-solving. Her work involves navigating complex human situations, but this seems more intuitive and relationship-based than analytical. Based on her self-description and interview responses, she seems more aligned with a preference for emotional and relational approaches over strict logical analysis.",
