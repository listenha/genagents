However, as one delves deeper into areas like calculus, statistics, or theoretical mathematics, it becomes highly complex. My experience with math has been that it requires both foundational understanding and advanced reasoning. I believe math is best understood as a subject that is neither purely simplistic nor purely complex, but rather a combination of both, depending on the level of study. Given that, I would place it closer to the middle of the spectrum, reflecting its dual nature."

It suggests a moment of introspection in a new place, which could imply a subtle feeling of homesickness. While there is no explicit rejection of the new city, the imagery of candlelight often evokes memories of home, especially in a foreign or unfamiliar setting.
