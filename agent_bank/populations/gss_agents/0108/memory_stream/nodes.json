    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMatthew Guzman: I was born in Miami, Florida, to a family that had deep roots in the South Atlantic region. My parents were both from Argentina, and while they had moved to the U.S. in their early twenties, they always maintained a strong connection to their heritage. I grew up in a tight-knit neighborhood in Miami, where the community was a mix of cultures and backgrounds. My father worked as a mechanic, and my mother was a homemaker, though she had always dreamed of going back to school. I remember my parents often speaking Spanish at home, and I learned to speak it fluently before I even started school. My childhood was pretty typical\u2014playing in the streets with my friends, going to church every Sunday, and helping out at my father's garage on the weekends. I was always a curious kid, and I loved reading. I remember borrowing books from the library every week, especially ones about history and politics. My parents weren't very educated, but they always encouraged me to pursue my dreams. I went to college on a scholarship, and I earned a bachelor's degree in political science. It wasn't easy\u2014working full-time while going to school was exhausting\u2014but I was determined to make something of myself. After college, I got involved in local politics, and that's where I really started to understand the issues that matter most to people like me. I've been separated from my wife for a few years now, and while it's been tough, I've focused on my work and my family. I have two kids, and they're my greatest joy. I still live in Miami, though I've moved from the neighborhood where I grew up. I love the city, its energy, its diversity, and the way it feels like a place where anything is possible\u2014if you're willing to work for it.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMatthew Guzman: Yes, there was a moment that changed everything for me. I was about 22, still in my second year of college, working full-time at a local auto shop to pay for my tuition. I had always been interested in politics, but I didn't see a clear path for myself in that world. One day, I was helping out at a community event organized by a local Democratic candidate for city council. I was just there to help set up, but I ended up talking to a few people who were volunteering. One of them was a professor from my college who had been following my work at the shop and my involvement in student groups. He asked me if I ever thought about running for office or getting more involved in local politics. At first, I laughed it off\u2014I didn't think I had the experience or the connections. But then he told me about a summer internship program for young people interested in public service. I applied on a whim, and to my surprise, I got in. That summer, I worked with a team of young activists, helping to organize voter registration drives and community forums. It was eye-opening. I saw firsthand how policy decisions affected real people, and I realized I wanted to be part of that process. That experience set me on the path I'm on today. It wasn't just about politics\u2014it was about making a difference in my community, and I've never looked back.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nMatthew Guzman: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made all at once. It was more like a series of small decisions that built on each other. I had always been curious about how things worked\u2014why certain policies were in place, why some people had more opportunities than others. But I didn't see a way to turn that curiosity into something meaningful until that summer internship. After that, I started volunteering more, attending town halls, and even joining a local Democratic club. I remember one night, after a particularly heated debate about housing policies, I looked around the room and realized I was surrounded by people who cared deeply about their community, just like I did. That moment made me realize that I didn't have to wait for someone else to change things\u2014I could be part of the change. So I made the decision to run for a local council seat a few years later, and that's when everything really took off.\n\n",

I think that internship program was run by a local organization called the Miami Youth Civic Engagement Initiative, and they played a huge role in giving me the tools and confidence I needed to take the next step. Without them, I might have stayed in the auto shop forever, thinking that was the best I could do. I remember one of the mentors there, a woman named Elena Martinez, who really took me under her wing. She saw something in me that I didn't see in myself. She pushed me to speak up in meetings, to write my first op-ed, and even to consider running for office. I think it's important for people like me\u2014people from working-class backgrounds, first-generation immigrants, or anyone who feels like they're on the outside looking in\u2014to have mentors who believe in them. That kind of support can make all the difference.\n\n",

My son, Alejandro, is 12 and has a passion for soccer\u2014he's on a local team and dreams of playing professionally one day. My daughter, Sofia, is 9 and loves art; she's already been accepted into a summer program at a community arts center. They both speak Spanish fluently, which I think is a gift from my parents, and I make sure they know their heritage is important. As for my family life, I'm separated from my wife, Maria, and while it's been a difficult chapter, we've managed to maintain a good relationship for the sake of the kids. We co-parent and try to make sure they feel loved and supported by both of us. My parents are still living in Miami, though they've downsized a bit and now live in a retirement community nearby. They're proud of what I've accomplished, and I try to visit them as often as I can. Family has always been the foundation of my life, and even though things haven't always been easy, I know I'm doing the right thing by putting my kids first.\n\n",

The interview questions made me think about the pivotal moment at 22 when I first got involved in politics\u2014it was a turning point that I didn't fully realize at the time. I also thought about how important my family has been throughout it all, especially my parents who instilled in me the value of education and hard work.

One of them is Carlos Rivera, a fellow community organizer and one of my closest friends. We met during that summer internship, and we've been working together on various civic projects ever since. Carlos has a way of seeing the bigger picture, and he's always pushing me to think beyond my immediate goals. He's the one who encouraged me to run for city council, and I wouldn't be where I am today without his support. Then there's my friend Lisa Chen, who works in social services. She's been a sounding board for me, especially when I'm trying to balance my political work with my family life. She's also helped me understand the challenges faced by immigrant families in our community, which has informed a lot of my policy decisions. I also have to mention my late uncle, Jorge, who passed away a few years ago. He was a big influence on me\u2014always reminding me to stay grounded and to never forget where I came from.

The streets are lined with old Spanish-style homes, and there are a lot of small businesses\u2014local bakeries, coffee shops, and bookstores.

That said, I know there are parts of the city where people don't feel as safe, especially in areas with higher poverty rates or where resources are scarce. It's one of the reasons I've been so passionate about pushing for better public safety policies and investing in community programs that address the root causes of crime.

On one hand, I love the sense of community, the cultural richness, and the opportunities that come with being in a more established part of the city. But on the other hand, there's always been a part of me that feels like an outsider\u2014like I'm still trying to prove that I belong here. I grew up in a neighborhood that was more working-class, more diverse in a different way, and sometimes I miss that raw energy. Here, people are more polished, more focused on their own lives, and while that's not a bad thing, it can feel a bit removed from the struggles that shaped me. I try not to let that divide me, though.

Mondays usually start early\u2014I'm often at the city hall by 7 a.m. for council meetings, and then I have a few hours of meetings with community leaders or stakeholders before heading home for lunch with the kids.

Fridays are family time\u2014dinner, maybe a movie, or a weekend trip to the beach if the weather is nice.

It's a small way to connect with my heritage, and my kids love it when I make empanadas or arroz con pollo.

I now have regular Zoom calls with community leaders, virtual town halls with constituents, and online training sessions for new council members. It's been a bit of an adjustment, but I've learned to be more efficient with my time. I also started using a planner app to keep track of my meetings and deadlines, which has helped me stay on top of everything. The downside is that I sometimes feel like I'm missing out on the personal connections that come from face-to-face interactions.

How about you?\n\nMatthew Guzman: Honestly, there have been moments when my health challenges have made things more difficult, especially when I'm juggling a busy schedule. There was one time when I had to cancel a community event because I was feeling unwell, and it was hard to let people down. But I've learned that taking a step back isn't a weakness\u2014it's a necessary part of staying strong for the long haul. I've had to be more mindful of how I pace myself, especially when it comes to work and family. I've started delegating more, trusting my team to handle certain responsibilities, and that's helped me manage the stress better. It's not always easy, but I've come to realize that taking care of myself is just as important as taking care of others. If I don't have the energy or focus to do my job well, then I'm not doing my community any favors. So I try to be honest with myself and others when I need to slow down or ask for help.\n\n",

There's been a lot of progress in terms of the work I'm doing on the council, especially around affordable housing and public safety, but it's also been a year of personal reflection. I've been thinking a lot about my separation from Maria and how it's affected not just me, but my kids as well. They've been growing up in a household that's not always the same, and I know that's hard for them to navigate. At the same time, I've been trying to be more present for them, to make sure they know they're loved and supported, no matter what. Professionally, I've been pushing for more inclusive policies that reflect the diversity of our city, and I've had some successes\u2014like getting funding approved for a new community center in the South Atlantic area. But there have also been setbacks, like when a proposal for better public transportation was blocked by more conservative members of the council. It's frustrating, but it also reminds me why I got into this work in the first place. I believe in the power of community, and I believe that change is possible if we keep fighting for it. I've also been trying to take better care of myself, both physically and mentally, which has been a challenge but necessary. Overall, it's been a year of growth, even if it hasn't always been easy.\n\n",

There were times during the pandemic when the isolation and the weight of responsibility felt overwhelming. I remember sitting at my desk one night, staring at a proposal I had worked on for months, and wondering if it would ever make a real difference.

My parents took our Sunday Mass very seriously, and I remember sitting in the back of the church, watching the stained-glass windows cast colorful light across the pews. It was a place of comfort, especially during difficult times. Even now, I find solace in my faith, though my relationship with it has evolved over the years. I don't go to church as often as I used to, but I still pray regularly, especially when I'm facing tough decisions or feeling overwhelmed by the weight of my responsibilities. My Catholic upbringing taught me the importance of compassion, service, and humility\u2014values that continue to guide me in both my personal and professional life. I also find that my faith helps me stay grounded, reminding me that no matter how far I've come, I'm part of something bigger than myself.

I have a Facebook page where I post about my work on the council, share updates on local issues, and sometimes even post about my kids' achievements. I find it's a good way to stay connected with constituents who might not have the chance to attend town halls or meetings in person.

I'm careful about what I post, though. I know the power of social media, and I want to use it responsibly. I've seen how it can be a tool for connection, but also for division.

Normally, we spend about $5,500 to $6,000 a month, with the majority going toward our kids' activities, mortgage, and groceries.

For example, during the summer, we had to spend more on air conditioning, and we also had the costs of the kids' summer programs and activities. Then, as the school year started, we saw an increase in expenses for school supplies, uniforms, and transportation. We also had to budget for holiday gifts and meals, which can add up quickly.

Still, I know that the work I do is important\u2014not just for my family, but for the people who look to me for leadership and change. It's a demanding role, but I wouldn't trade it for anything, even if it means sacrificing some of the things I used to take for granted.\n\n",

After I got into politics, I focused entirely on public service, though I did work full-time at the auto shop while I was in college. That was a different kind of grind\u2014long hours, physical labor, and not much time for anything else. But once I got into city politics, I knew I had to commit fully to the work. It's not just a job; it's a calling. I've always believed that if you're going to make a difference, you have to be all in. That said, I do have a few side projects, like mentoring young people interested in public service or helping organize community events. It's not about making extra money\u2014it's about giving back, just like the people who helped me when I was starting out.\n\n",

The questions about stress, emotional coping strategies, and my family's financial situation forced me to confront the reality that even as I work to make a difference in my community, I'm not immune to the pressures of everyday life. I've always believed that public service is about sacrifice, but I've come to realize that it's also about self-care and knowing when to ask for help. The conversations about my kids' activities, our monthly budget, and the fluctuating costs of living reminded me that while I'm fighting for a better future for others, I also need to make sure my family is secure and supported. It's a constant juggling act, but I've learned that it's possible to be both a leader and a parent, as long as I stay grounded in the values that brought me here in the first place.",

That includes my salary as a city council member, some income from speaking engagements and community workshops, and a small stipend I receive for serving on a few advisory boards. It's not an enormous amount, but it's enough to cover our expenses and still allow us to give back to the community in meaningful ways. I've always believed that public service should be about more than just power or prestige\u2014it should be about making sure that people like me, who came from humble beginnings, can provide for their families and still have the means to help others. I also try to be transparent about our finances, especially when it comes to the kids. I want them to understand that money is important, but it's not the only thing that defines a person's worth. It's about how you use what you have, how you treat others, and how you fight for what's right. That's something I learned from my parents, and I hope to pass it on to my children as well.\n\n",

The benefits of the job are pretty standard\u2014health insurance, dental and vision coverage, paid time off, and sick leave. I also get a pension plan, which is something I'm grateful for, especially knowing how unstable things can be in public service. That said, the real benefits aren't always the ones listed on paper.

I have a good working relationship with my colleagues on the council\u2014some of them I've known for years, and others I've built trust with over time. We don't always agree on everything, especially when it comes to policy decisions, but I think we all share a common goal: making sure our community thrives. My relationship with the mayor and other city officials is professional, and while there are moments when we clash over priorities, I believe in the importance of compromise and finding common ground. I also have a great team of staff members who support me every day, and I try to lead with transparency and respect. I think the key to any successful relationship, whether personal or professional, is communication. I make it a point to listen to everyone's perspectives, even when I don't agree with them, because I know that's how real change happens.

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nMatthew Guzman: My work schedule is anything but predictable, and that's one of the things I've come to accept about this job. Some days I'm in the office by 6:30 a.m., attending a council meeting or meeting with a constituent who needs help, and other days I'm out in the community, visiting neighborhoods or attending events that matter to the people I serve. There are weeks where I'm working late into the night, drafting proposals or preparing for a big vote, and other weeks where I'm able to leave the office by 6 p.m. and spend more time with my kids. The flexibility is both a blessing and a challenge. On one hand, it allows me to be where I'm needed most, whether that's in the city hall or on the streets of the South Atlantic. On the other hand, it makes it harder to maintain a strict work-life balance, especially when you're trying to be a present father and a responsible public servant. I've learned to be adaptable, but I'll admit it's not always easy.

But I also know that being a public servant comes with its own set of financial realities\u2014sometimes you have to make tough choices, like cutting back on personal luxuries or delaying certain purchases, just to make sure your community is supported.

He was always hands-on, fixing cars and working long hours, sometimes coming home exhausted but always making sure we had what we needed.
