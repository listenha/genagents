After college, she chose to join a tech startup over a traditional finance firm, a decision that led to a successful career shift when the startup was acquired. Now, she balances her full-time job with self-improvement, mindfulness practices, and maintaining close ties with her mother and a tight-knit group of friends. Her life is shaped by a tension between the demands of her high-paced career and her commitment to personal well-being, reflected in her structured routine and efforts to save for the future. She speaks with a grounded confidence, often emphasizing the value of support systems and the importance of calculated risks in shaping her path."
