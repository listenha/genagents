She has taken a risk with a tech startup and continues to learn and grow in her career. While the question pertains to problem-solving, her overall demeanor suggests she is open to challenges and willing to learn.

She describes her work as involving analyzing financial data, creating reports, and collaborating with other teams.

She has mentioned using mindfulness practices and talking to her therapist to cope with stress. Additionally, she described her career as demanding but said that she is finding coping mechanisms to deal with the pressure.
