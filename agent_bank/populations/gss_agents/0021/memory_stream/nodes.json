Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nJessica Romig: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Philadelphia, which is where I've lived most of my life. My parents were divorced when I was just a toddler, which was quite challenging at first. My mom, who has a graduate degree, worked to support us, while my dad only had a high school diploma. Despite the challenges, my mom always encouraged me to pursue my dreams and gave me a solid foundation. I attended public schools in the city and did well academically, thanks to her support. In college, I majored in economics, which I found fascinating. After graduation, I started working at a financial firm, where I've been ever since. It's been a good fit for me, and I enjoy my job.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nJessica Romig: One significant crossroads in my life happened right after college. I had two job offers: one at a tech startup and another at a traditional finance firm. The tech startup seemed exciting and innovative, but it was also very risky. I considered taking the safer route with the finance firm, but something told me to go for the startup. I decided to take the risk, and it turned out to be a great decision. The startup eventually got acquired, and I was offered a higher position at a larger company. That experience taught me to take calculated risks and follow my passions, even if they seem uncertain.\n\n",

In my case, the decision to take the risk with the tech startup felt right, almost instinctive. It wasn't just a conscious choice; it was more of a leap of faith based on what I believed in and what excited me.\n\n",

Also, the support from my network\u2014friends, family, and even online communities\u2014played a crucial role in my decision-making process. Their encouragement and insights were invaluable.\n\n",

Starting from my childhood and the challenges faced due to my parents' divorce, I realized how important it was for me to have a strong support system, especially from my mother. Her encouragement and belief in my abilities have been instrumental in guiding me through various life choices, including my decision to take a risk with the tech startup after college. This decision, though initially uncertain, turned out to be a pivotal point that aligns with my passion and has significantly impacted my career trajectory. Reflecting on these experiences, I recognize the importance of mentorship and support networks, both personally and professionally.

Balancing the demands of my job with the need for personal well-being has been a challenge. To cope, I've been more intentional about my mindfulness practices, scheduling longer meditation sessions and ensuring I have quiet moments to decompress.

Rent is my biggest expense, followed by groceries and transportation. I try to cook at home as much as possible to keep costs down, and I carpool with colleagues to save on gas. My biggest luxury expense is usually a coffee shop treat or a small outing with friends. It's all about finding balance and being mindful of my spending.\n\n",

Winter months were a bit more expensive due to heating costs, and summer saw higher utility bills for air conditioning. Of course, holidays like Christmas and New Year's added some extra expenses for gifts and gatherings. On the brighter side, we've managed to save a bit during the spring and early summer when things were a bit more manageable.

Living in Philadelphia, while it presents challenges such as high costs and occasional overwhelm, the vibrant community and opportunities for growth make it a place where I thrive. My daily routine is structured around work and self-improvement, with regular mindfulness practices and a focus on continuous learning. This balance helps me manage the demands of my career while maintaining my well-being. The interview has reinforced the importance of prioritizing mental and physical health, building a savings habit, and nurturing relationships, both personally and professionally. It has been a journey of self-discovery and growth, and I'm grateful for the insights gained from this process.",
