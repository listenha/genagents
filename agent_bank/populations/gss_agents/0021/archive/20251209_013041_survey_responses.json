            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Jessica describes herself as someone who enjoys spending time with friends and colleagues but doesn't mention being outgoing or seeking the center of attention. She also mentions that she enjoys more intimate settings like walking around with friends or meeting up for a picnic. This suggests she leans more towards being reserved rather than outgoing.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Jessica seems to be someone who maintains positive and trusting relationships with her mother, friends, and colleagues. She values these connections and relies on them for support, indicating a generally trusting nature. Additionally, her openness to taking risks and trusting her instincts when making career decisions suggests she trusts others and herself. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that she would fall closer to the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Jessica's responses, she appears to be someone who values discipline and hard work. She talks about her structured routine, mindfulness practices, and the importance of self-care and continuous learning. She also mentions her successful career progression and the challenges she faces with work pressure, indicating a strong work ethic. Therefore, it's unlikely that Jessica would see herself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Jessica describes herself as facing significant work pressures and stresses, but she has been coping with these challenges through mindfulness practices and a strong support network. While she mentions feeling stressed at times, she also notes that she is managing these feelings through strategies such as meditation and journaling, which suggests she is reasonably good at handling stress. Given her awareness of her stress levels and the strategies she employs, it seems she falls closer to the middle of the spectrum rather than at the extremes.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Jessica describes herself as someone who enjoys spending time with friends and colleagues, attending industry conferences, and engaging in personal development activities. While she doesn't mention specific artistic interests, her active involvement in professional and social life suggests she might not fall into the category of having very few artistic interests. However, since she doesn't explicitly state a strong interest in art, it's reasonable to assume she might lean towards having fewer artistic interests compared to someone who is deeply engaged in artistic activities.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Jessica describes herself as someone who maintains close relationships with her mother, friends, and colleagues, and engages in activities like meeting up with friends and attending networking events. She mentions that her relationships with friends and colleagues are important to her, indicating a sociable and outgoing personality. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that she would choose a higher number on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Jessica is described as someone who is slightly liberal, independent, and has a supportive network. She values personal growth, continuous learning, and has close relationships with her mother and friends. Jessica seems to be someone who is generally positive and supportive, which suggests she would not see herself as frequently finding fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on Jessica's responses, she seems to value thoroughness and quality in her work. She mentions taking on freelance projects to diversify her skills and potentially earn extra income, indicating a desire to excel. Additionally, she discusses the importance of staying updated on market trends and conducting thorough research for her job, suggesting she is committed to doing a thorough job. This aligns more closely with someone who would choose 5.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on Jessica's interview, she seems to have a good balance of resilience and adaptability. While she mentions facing challenges and uncertainties in her career, she also talks about effective coping mechanisms like mindfulness and support from her network. Her description of handling work pressures and personal challenges suggests she is not overly prone to nervousness. However, given the nature of her job and the industry she works in, she may still experience some level of nervousness or anxiety from time to time.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Jessica seems to have a more pragmatic and analytical mindset, focusing on her career in finance and her support network for emotional and professional guidance. While she appreciates the importance of creativity and innovation, her primary focus is on her professional responsibilities and the structured aspects of her life. She has taken calculated risks in her career and relies on her support system for guidance, suggesting a preference for a more balanced and practical approach rather than an overly imaginative one."

            "REI_1": "Based on the interview, Jessica demonstrates a strong inclination towards professional success in a field she's passionate about, indicating that she likely has the skills and confidence to handle complex problems. Additionally, her career as a financial analyst suggests that she faces and manages complicated tasks regularly. Therefore, it is less likely that she would choose 1, as it doesn't align with her described competencies and experiences.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Jessica seems to have a career in finance, which requires analytical skills, and she mentions taking on more responsibility after the startup acquisition. This suggests she likely has some capacity for logical analysis. However, she does mention feeling stressed at times and that her work can be demanding, indicating she might not excel in all aspects of logical analysis under stress. Therefore, it seems more likely that she would rate herself slightly below average in this ability.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Jessica appears to have a balanced approach to problem-solving. She emphasizes the importance of mindfulness and emotional coping strategies, which suggests she values intuition and holistic approaches. However, she also has a job that requires analytical thinking, such as financial analysis, indicating she does have some analytical skills. Given her balanced view and the importance she places on non-analytical methods like meditation and personal values, it seems she leans slightly towards the non-analytical side but not strongly.",
            "REI_4": "Based on Jessica's interview, she seems to value intuition and instinct in making decisions. She describes her decision to take a risk with the tech startup as more of a gut feeling rather than a conscious choice. Additionally, she mentions that sometimes her decisions 'just happened,' which suggests a less analytical approach. Jessica also talks about taking calculated risks rather than purely logical ones, indicating a preference for more intuitive decision-making. Therefore, it is more likely that Jessica would lean towards the lower end of the spectrum.",
            "REI_5": "Given Jessica's reflection on her career and the challenges she faces, she mentions that her work can be demanding and that she has had to cope with increased pressures and uncertainties. However, she also talks about using mindfulness practices and emotional coping strategies, which suggests she has developed some tools to handle stress. Additionally, she describes her work relationships positively and her supportive network, indicating she has resources to fall back on. While she does mention that stress is a challenge, she doesn't seem to completely break down under pressure.",
            "REI_6": "Based on Jessica's interview responses, she seems to have a balanced view of her own logical reasoning abilities. She has a strong educational background and works in a field that requires analytical thinking, such as financial analysis. However, she also mentions that she can be overwhelmed by the fast pace of her work and sometimes needs to manage stress through mindfulness practices. This suggests she recognizes her capabilities but doesn't necessarily view herself as significantly better than most people in logical reasoning.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Jessica is described as someone who works in a financial firm and takes calculated risks, suggesting she is analytical and strategic. She also mentions that she enjoys working in a field she finds fascinating (economics), indicating she likely has a logical mind. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume she would rate herself a 5.",
            "REI_8": "Based on the interview, Jessica describes herself as someone who trusts her instincts and follows her passions, which suggests she might lean towards making decisions based on gut feelings and less on careful deliberation. However, her experience with taking risks and making career decisions also shows a level of thoughtful consideration. Given her emphasis on the importance of mentorship and support networks, it indicates she values input and reflection, but she doesn't necessarily take extensive time to think through everything. Therefore, a middle-ground response seems most fitting.",
            "REI_9": "Jessica described herself as someone who makes conscious decisions and follows her passions, even if they seem uncertain. She also mentioned that sometimes these decisions feel natural and instinctive, suggesting a reliance on logic and intuition.

            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Jessica tends to reflect on her decisions and often describes her choices as instinctive rather than purely logical. For example, when discussing her decision to take the risk with the tech startup, she mentions that it felt right rather than a deliberate plan. However, she does recognize the importance of gut feelings and acknowledges that sometimes these decisions happen almost instinctively. This suggests that while she doesn't always have explicit reasons, she values clarity in her decision-making."
