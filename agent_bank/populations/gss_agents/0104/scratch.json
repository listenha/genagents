  "agent_profile_summary": "Maria Lopez, a 39-year-old mother of two living in Miami, moved to the U.S. from Seville, Spain, at age five, navigating a new language and culture while growing up in a working-class household after her father left. Her mother’s sacrifices and determination to provide education shaped Maria’s resolve, culminating in a pivotal decision at sixteen to move to Miami for better opportunities, despite the fear and loneliness of starting over. Now, she balances full-time work at a local grocery store with evening classes toward a master’s in business, driven by a desire to secure a better future for her children. A committed caregiver and community member, she mentors young women at work and stays connected with her extended family, even as she manages her recent diabetes diagnosis with resilience. Her life is defined by a steady push toward stability and growth, guided by faith, family, and the belief that perseverance can turn even the hardest beginnings into a hopeful future."
