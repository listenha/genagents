For someone like Maria, who moved from Spain to the U.S. as a child and has built a life in Miami, this clue would likely reflect a mix of both wanderlust and homesickness.

While it is not particularly 'zesty' in the traditional sense of being spicy or tangy, it does have a noticeable and somewhat bold flavor profile compared to plain water or other bland drinks. However, it is not overly intense or vibrant in the way that something like citrus or spicy food would be. Based on my experience with the drink, I would place it closer to the 'bland' end of the spectrum, as it lacks the strong, zesty qualities that would push it toward 100."
