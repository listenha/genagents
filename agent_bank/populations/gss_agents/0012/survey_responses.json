While she mentions experiencing stress and anxiety in certain moments, such as during work and family planning, she also describes using coping mechanisms like mindfulness and regular check-ins with her partner to manage these feelings. This suggests she is not someone who gets nervous easily in most situations, but also acknowledges that it is a part of her life. Therefore, a middle ground between 1 and 5 seems most appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Lauren Williams seems to be a pragmatic and grounded individual who focuses on her career and family life. She describes herself as conservative and prefers stability over adventure, which suggests she might not engage in much imaginative thinking.

Given her cautious nature and preference for practical matters, it's more likely she would lean towards the lower end of the scale."
