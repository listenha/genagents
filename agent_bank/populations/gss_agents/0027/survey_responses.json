            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Amin Hassan seems to be someone who values community and support, often stepping up to help his family and community. He mentions feeling overwhelmed when things get hectic, which suggests he might not be extremely comfortable in very large social settings or being the center of attention. However, he does mention having good friends and participating in community activities, indicating he can be sociable when he chooses to be. Given these factors, he is more likely to lean towards being somewhat reserved rather than very outgoing.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Amin seems to have experienced significant challenges and losses in his life, such as the death of his father at a young age. While these experiences may have taught him to be cautious, he also values community support and has shown a willingness to help others and build relationships. His comments about the importance of community and support suggest a more optimistic view of people, even if he may not trust everyone immediately.",

He mentions that he sets aside time for relaxation and tries to prioritize his well-being, indicating that he is not someone who is lazy.

            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Amin has shared that he has definitely struggled with anxiety at times, especially when things get really hectic. He mentions trying to manage his anxiety better by setting aside time for relaxation and talking to friends and family when he needs to. This indicates that while he does experience stress, he is actively working on strategies to cope with it. However, given the intensity of his schedule and the recent challenges he has faced, it seems he is not yet at the point where he feels entirely relaxed and in control of all stressors. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems most appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Amin Hassan seems to be someone who values community support and giving back, but his responses indicate that he is focused on practical and academic goals rather than artistic ones.

He has described himself as someone who tries to manage his responsibilities well and seeks to maintain a balanced life. These traits suggest that he would likely see himself as someone who does a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Amin has faced significant challenges and responsibilities, including taking care of his family after his father's passing and managing a part-time job, school, and community work. Despite these pressures, he has described coping strategies like mindfulness and seeking support from friends and family. He also mentioned managing anxiety during stressful periods. While Amin has experienced anxiety, he seems to have developed coping mechanisms and resilience, which suggests he is more likely to feel nervous occasionally rather than frequently.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Amin describes himself as slightly conservative and independent, with a focus on balancing work, school, and community responsibilities. He doesn't mention having a vivid or active imagination in his responses, and seems more focused on practical matters.
