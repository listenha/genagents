Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAmin Hassan: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in San Diego, California, to a Muslim family. My parents are originally from the Middle East but moved here when they were young. They settled in a neighborhood called Point Loma, which is a beautiful area overlooking the ocean. Growing up, we lived with both my parents and my younger sister, though my father passed away when I was just 15. That was a tough time, but it also taught me a lot about resilience and faith.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAmin Hassan: That was indeed a pivotal moment. After my father's passing, my mother took on the role of the primary caregiver and breadwinner. It was challenging, but together we managed. My mother worked hard at her job, often coming home late, and I stepped up to help take care of my sister and manage household tasks. This experience really solidified my values and taught me the importance of perseverance and hard work. It also influenced my political views, making me more appreciative of the opportunities and support systems in place for families in need.\n\n",

I remember my mother telling me that she was going to keep working and support our family, even though it meant long hours and sacrifices. That really resonated with me, and I decided to follow in her footsteps by working part-time during my senior year of high school to help out. It wasn't easy, but it taught me the value of hard work and responsibility. Since then, I've always tried to be self-reliant and contribute to my community whenever possible.\n\n",

However, my mother felt it was important to handle things ourselves. She believed that relying on external help could undermine our independence.

It's been a bit of a rollercoaster, but I'm trying to stay focused on my goals and the support network around me.\n\n",

What were your biggest expenses last month?\n\nAmin Hassan: When it comes to finances, it's definitely a balancing act. My biggest expenses last month were rent, groceries, and transportation. Rent takes up the largest portion since it's fixed, but groceries and gas for my car are always variable depending on the week. I try to keep a budget and track my spending, but there are times when unexpected costs pop up, like repairs for my apartment or a doctor's visit. It's important to stay on top of things to avoid falling behind, but it can be tough when you're juggling so many responsibilities.\n\n",

My mom and I split the remaining expenses, like utilities and internet, which come to about $400 combined. Sometimes, we might spend a bit more on unexpected things, like when my laptop broke and I had to replace it. Overall, it's a tight budget, but we manage.

Additionally, there were months when my car insurance premium was due, which added to the financial burden.

    "content": "Completing this interview and reflecting on my life story has been both enlightening and humbling. From my childhood in San Diego to the challenges I've faced and the values I've learned along the way, it's clear that every experience has shaped who I am today. The resilience and self-reliance I developed after my father's passing have guided me through the ups and downs of my current life, from balancing a part-time job and schoolwork to navigating the demands of community involvement and personal relationships. The support of my family, particularly my mother, has been a constant source of strength and inspiration. Her emphasis on hard work, community support, and the importance of giving back has left a lasting impact on me. As I move forward, I am committed to carrying these lessons into my future endeavors, ensuring that I remain grounded and dedicated to my goals. This interview has not only provided an opportunity to share my story but has also served as a reminder of the importance of perseverance, community, and the power of resilience in shaping one's life journey.",
