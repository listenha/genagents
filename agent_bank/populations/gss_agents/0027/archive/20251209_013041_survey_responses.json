            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Amin has described himself as someone who values community and support, and he has participated in various community activities. He also mentioned forming close friendships and connecting with others. These traits suggest that he is more sociable and outgoing rather than reserved. However, the interview also revealed that he has faced significant personal challenges, which might lead him to be more introspective and reserved in certain contexts. Given his overall demeanor and the variety of activities he engages in, it seems he leans more towards being sociable but acknowledges his reserved side, which would place him closer to the middle of the scale.",

However, he has also mentioned strategies like mindfulness exercises and setting aside time for relaxation to cope with stress. This indicates that while he acknowledges dealing with stress, he also actively works to manage it, suggesting he is not at the extreme end of struggling with stress. Therefore, a middle-ground option seems most fitting.",

He has been trying to manage it better by setting aside time for relaxation and seeking support from friends and family. This suggests that while he does experience nervousness, he is actively working on managing it, which indicates he is not constantly overwhelmed by nervousness. Therefore, he is more likely to choose a number closer to 1 rather than 5.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Amin describes himself as someone who has faced numerous challenges and has had to find creative solutions and maintain a positive outlook.
