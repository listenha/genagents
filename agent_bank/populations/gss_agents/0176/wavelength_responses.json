My own experiences with unexpected challenges—like the back pain I've dealt with or the unexpected car repairs—have made me more inclined to see life as unpredictable and influenced by chance.

In my experience, smoke detectors are generally neutral—only becoming annoying when they are overly sensitive or false-alarm frequently. I have never found one to be entertaining, but I also don’t find them annoying unless they are problematic. Given that, I would place it closer to the neutral side of the spectrum, slightly leaning toward 'annoying' due to the potential for false alarms."
