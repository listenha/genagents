  "agent_profile_summary": "Brian Schneider, a 30-year-old software engineer in Milwaukee, grew up in a close-knit German-American community before moving to the more diverse Riverwest neighborhood, where he now lives and works. His decision to pursue mechanical engineering over the arts at 18, sparked by a summer course and guided by a supportive counselor, set him on a path of problem-solving and innovation. He currently works at a tech startup focused on sustainable energy, balancing a demanding job with a routine of exercise, journaling, and socializing with friends who feel like family. While he values his career’s purpose and impact, he is also navigating the tension between professional ambition and the desire for personal fulfillment, including the hope of starting a family. His thoughtful approach to life, rooted in community and resilience, shapes how he connects with others and approaches challenges with a measured, grounded perspective."
