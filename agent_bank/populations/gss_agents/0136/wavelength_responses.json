I’ve seen some horror movies that were genuinely scary and left me shaken, while others were more about suspense or psychological tension.

Based on my experience, a horror movie typically falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum—scary enough to be engaging but not so overwhelming that it becomes unbearable. I would place it around 60, as it's more likely to be frightening than boring, but not necessarily terrifying to the point of being 'scared to death.'"

On the other hand, especially in areas like environmental science or higher-level mathematics, it can become deeply abstract and challenging. My experience with math in school was more on the simplistic side, but as I explored environmental science and sustainability, I saw how math can be used to model complex systems and solve real-world problems. This duality makes me place it somewhere in the middle, leaning slightly toward the complex side because of the depth it can reach when applied to meaningful issues."

These notes have always felt personal and full of care. While it's possible for a hand-written note to be cold or impersonal, I believe the default emotional tone of a hand-written note is more likely to be warm and fuzzy, especially when it comes from someone close.

They existed long before humans and were part of a natural, evolutionary process that was not guided by the idea of 'improvement' in the sense of civilization. However, their extinction was a significant event that shaped the course of life on Earth, which could be seen as a random occurrence. Given that their existence and extinction were part of natural processes, I lean more toward the 'random' side of the spectrum, but not entirely. Dinosaurs are a reminder that history is not always linear or predictable, which aligns more with the 'history is random' end of the spectrum."

While I don’t have direct experience with venture capital, my understanding of it aligns with an aggressive mindset—driven by ambition, risk-taking, and a focus on growth.

In my experience, smoke detectors are usually quiet and only become noticeable when they are triggered by smoke, which is a serious situation. However, I can imagine that a malfunctioning or overly sensitive detector could be annoying, but it is not usually something that is entertaining. I place it closer to the middle of the spectrum because it is neither inherently annoying nor entertaining, but rather a neutral, functional object."

While it could imply a sense of adventure, the mention of 'New City' and the imagery of candlelight might also evoke a feeling of isolation or longing for a more familiar environment. Based on my experiences with moving to new places and adjusting to unfamiliar surroundings, I associate this clue more with a subtle sense of homesickness rather than a strong desire to wander. It feels like a moment of contemplation in a new place, which leans more toward the homesick end of the spectrum."

However, I've also learned the importance of stepping back and taking time for myself, whether through meditation, journaling, or simply choosing not to attend every social event. 'Avatar 2' feels like a balance between these two extremes, suggesting a moment of reflection or a decision to sit out for a reason. I place it closer to the 'need to sit one out' side because I've come to value the importance of taking breaks and prioritizing my well-being, even if it means not being part of every event."
