She has also mentioned being open about her struggles, such as anxiety and job search challenges, which suggests a level of emotional openness. However, she also mentions being 'stubborn about handling everything on my own' in the past, which indicates a tendency to be private or reserved in certain situations.

She has spoken positively about the support she has received from her mother and sister, and she values connection and community.

She has described feeling overwhelmed, having days where she couldn't get out of bed, and needing to work on self-compassion and mindfulness to manage her mental health. While she has made progress, she still acknowledges the challenges of handling stress well, suggesting she would not score very high on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Madeline mentions friends and activities that involve creativity, such as her friend Marcus, who is a musician, and her own interest in learning Spanish, which involves cultural and linguistic creativity. While she does not explicitly mention artistic hobbies like painting or music, she shows an appreciation for creativity in other forms, such as community engagement and learning.

However, she also demonstrates a commitment to personal growth, such as learning Spanish, volunteering, and reflecting on her life. She often talks about trying to be more consistent and intentional, which suggests she values thoroughness, even if she doesn’t always achieve it. Her reflective nature and efforts to improve suggest she would likely rate herself somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Madeline has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, particularly in relation to her job search and uncertainty about her future. She described feeling overwhelmed, having trouble getting out of bed, and experiencing self-doubt. These are all signs of someone who gets nervous easily. While she has made progress in managing her anxiety, her self-reported experiences align more with the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Madeline mentions her interest in learning Spanish, her engagement with environmental issues, and her appreciation for creativity through friends like Marcus, who is a musician. She also reflects on her ability to find meaning in small moments and has a reflective, introspective nature. While she is not explicitly described as having a highly active imagination, her openness to learning, her appreciation for creativity, and her reflective nature suggest she may lean toward the middle to higher end of the scale."

She acknowledges her struggles with anxiety and uncertainty but also shows a tendency to analyze her experiences, reevaluate her choices, and make intentional efforts to improve her well-being. This suggests she is more inclined to reason things out carefully, even if she sometimes feels overwhelmed by the process.",
            "REI_5": "Madeline has described feeling overwhelmed during periods of uncertainty, particularly during her job search and when dealing with anxiety. She has mentioned struggling with self-doubt and feeling stuck in loops of uncertainty, which suggests she may not reason well under pressure.

She reflects on her life with a focus on feelings, relationships, and meaning rather than strictly logical or analytical reasoning.

She acknowledges uncertainty, emotional challenges, and the importance of small, meaningful actions. While she does show some analytical thinking (e.g., tracking expenses, planning routines), she also emphasizes emotional coping strategies and the value of connection over purely logical problem-solving. This suggests she may not fully align with the logic-first approach.",

            "REI_1": "Madeline has described moments of feeling stuck during her job search, struggling with graduate school, and experiencing anxiety around uncertainty. She has also reflected on her need to reevaluate her path and has shown a tendency to feel overwhelmed by pressure. These experiences suggest she may not feel confident in her ability to solve complex problems, aligning more with the lower end of the range.",
            "REI_2": "Madeline describes herself as someone who values mindfulness, emotional well-being, and community engagement. While she is reflective and values learning, she also acknowledges moments of uncertainty and self-doubt, particularly around her career path and job search. There is no explicit mention of her skills in logical analysis or problem-solving. However, her focus on emotional and practical aspects of life, rather than abstract or analytical tasks, suggests she may not see herself as particularly strong in this area.",
            "REI_3": "Madeline reflects on her life with a focus on emotional growth, relationships, and personal development. She describes her journey in a reflective and intuitive way, emphasizing feelings, personal connections, and mindfulness over structured problem-solving. She does not mention analytical thinking or data-driven decision-making as a strength or part of her identity. Instead, she focuses on emotional and relational aspects of her life, suggesting she is more intuitive and less analytical.",
            "REI_4": "Madeline demonstrates thoughtful reflection throughout the interview, often considering her decisions and their impacts. She reflects on her choices, such as dropping out of graduate school, and evaluates her actions with self-awareness. She also discusses her mental health, coping strategies, and financial planning in a deliberate and reflective manner, which suggests she does reason things out carefully.",
            "REI_5": "Madeline has described experiencing anxiety and self-doubt, particularly during her job search and periods of uncertainty. She has also mentioned struggling with motivation and feeling overwhelmed at times. These traits suggest she may find it challenging to reason well under pressure, aligning more with the lower end of the range.",
            "REI_6": "Madeline describes herself as someone who values community, emotional well-being, and personal growth over rigid logical structures. She reflects on her life with a focus on emotional and relational experiences, and while she is thoughtful and introspective, she does not emphasize logical reasoning as a core strength. Her narrative suggests a more intuitive and emotionally driven approach to life rather than a strictly logical one.",
            "REI_7": "Madeline describes herself as someone who values connection, growth, and mindfulness, and often reflects on her emotions and experiences in a thoughtful, introspective way. While she does show some analytical thinking (e.g., tracking her budget, reflecting on her life choices), her narrative is more centered on emotional and relational aspects of her life rather than logical or systematic approaches. This suggests she may not strongly identify with having a 'logical mind' as the primary way she processes the world.",
            "REI_8": "Madeline often reflects on her decisions and experiences, such as when she dropped out of graduate school or when she reevaluated her career path. She also mentions practices like journaling, mindfulness, and setting small, intentional routines. These behaviors suggest she values thoughtful reflection and careful consideration, even if she sometimes struggles with self-doubt or uncertainty.",
            "REI_9": "Madeline reflects on her life with a mix of emotional insight and practical problem-solving. She acknowledges her struggles with anxiety and uncertainty, but also shows a willingness to adapt, learn, and grow. She uses self-reflection, mindfulness, and support from others to navigate challenges. While she does not explicitly mention logic as her primary tool, her approach to problem-solving—such as tracking expenses, setting small goals, and adjusting her routine—suggests a practical and thoughtful approach that aligns with moderate use of logic.",
            "REI_10": "Madeline reflects on her life with a lot of introspection and acknowledges the influence of external factors, such as her parents' divorce, her job search, and her mental health. She often describes decisions as being influenced by feelings of uncertainty, self-doubt, and external support, rather than purely logical or clear-cut reasoning. While she does reflect on her choices, she also admits to struggling with self-criticism and feeling like she is 'just going through the motions' at times, which suggests she does not always have clear, explainable reasons for her decisions."
