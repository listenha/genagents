            "BFI-10_1": "Madeline describes herself as someone who has been independent, has leaned on others during tough times, and has maintained relationships with friends and family. She has also mentioned being open about her struggles, such as anxiety and job search challenges, which suggests a level of emotional openness. However, she also mentions being 'stubborn about handling everything on my own' in the past, which indicates a tendency to be private or reserved in certain situations. This suggests she may not see herself as completely outgoing, but she also doesn't seem to see herself as highly reserved either.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Madeline has described her life with a sense of resilience and openness, especially in her relationships with family and friends. She has spoken positively about the support she has received from her mother and sister, and she values connection and community. While she has experienced challenges and moments of self-doubt, she has also shown a willingness to lean on others and trust in the support of those around her. This suggests a moderate to high level of trust in others.",

            "BFI-10_4": "Madeline has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety and stress, particularly during her job search and after dropping out of graduate school. She has described feeling overwhelmed, having days where she couldn't get out of bed, and needing to work on self-compassion and mindfulness to manage her mental health. While she has made progress, she still acknowledges the challenges of handling stress well, suggesting she would not score very high on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Madeline mentions friends and activities that involve creativity, such as her friend Marcus, who is a musician, and her own interest in learning Spanish, which involves cultural and linguistic creativity. While she does not explicitly mention artistic hobbies like painting or music, she shows an appreciation for creativity in other forms, such as community engagement and learning.

            "BFI-10_6": "Madeline describes herself as someone who values connection with family and friends, and she maintains regular contact with her mother, sister, and a few close friends. However, she also mentions that she has struggled with feelings of loneliness and has been more introspective during periods of job searching.

Her sociability seems more rooted in meaningful, close relationships rather than being outwardly outgoing.",

There is no indication in the interview that she tends to find fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Madeline has shown moments of self-criticism and a tendency to feel stuck or uncertain, particularly regarding her job search and career path. However, she also demonstrates a commitment to personal growth, such as learning Spanish, volunteering, and reflecting on her life. She often talks about trying to be more consistent and intentional, which suggests she values thoroughness, even if she doesn’t always achieve it. Her reflective nature and efforts to improve suggest she would likely rate herself somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Madeline has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, particularly in relation to her job search and uncertainty about her future. She described feeling overwhelmed, having trouble getting out of bed, and experiencing self-doubt. These are all signs of someone who gets nervous easily. While she has made progress in managing her anxiety, her self-reported experiences align more with the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Madeline mentions her interest in learning Spanish, her engagement with environmental issues, and her appreciation for creativity through friends like Marcus, who is a musician. She also reflects on her ability to find meaning in small moments and has a reflective, introspective nature. While she is not explicitly described as having a highly active imagination, her openness to learning, her appreciation for creativity, and her reflective nature suggest she may lean toward the middle to higher end of the scale."
