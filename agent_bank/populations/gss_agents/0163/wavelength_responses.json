My own education included both sides of the spectrum, and I’ve seen how math can be applied in practical ways (like in business analysis) as well as in abstract, theoretical contexts.

That said, many cats can be affectionate and show clear signs of friendliness, especially with people they trust. Given this balance, I would place the clue 'cat' closer to the middle, but slightly leaning toward the 'standoffish' side due to their general tendency to be more reserved."

While it has a humorous or pessimistic tone, it still implies a kind of deterministic view of the world, where negative outcomes are not random but rather the result of overlooked causes. My own experiences with challenges in life, like career decisions or parenting, have often felt like they were influenced by a series of small, interconnected choices and events, not pure randomness. This makes me lean more toward the causality side of the spectrum."

They were a dominant species for a long time, but their extinction was a significant and somewhat abrupt event, which could be seen as random. However, their existence also paved the way for the evolution of mammals and eventually humans, which could be interpreted as part of a broader pattern of development. Given this, I place the clue closer to the 'history is random' side, as the extinction of dinosaurs was not a planned or progressive event but rather a result of external factors like an asteroid impact."

In my experience, smoke detectors are generally neutral—only becoming a nuisance when they are triggered unnecessarily. However, they are not designed to be entertaining. Given that, I would place it closer to the neutral side of the spectrum, slightly leaning toward 'annoying' due to the potential for false alarms and the loud noise they produce."

On the other hand, the imagery of candlelight might imply a sense of loneliness or reflection, which could lean toward homesickness. Based on my own experiences of moving to a new city and adjusting to life in Fremont, I understand the tension between excitement for new opportunities and the longing for familiar surroundings. The clue seems to hover between these two emotions, but I lean slightly toward wanderlust because the mention of a 'new city' suggests a moment of exploration or curiosity, even if it's accompanied by a touch of reflection."
