Married to Sofia and father to two young children, Isabella and Miguel, he balances a demanding career with active involvement in his children’s lives, from dance classes to a shared gardening project. A committed community member, he volunteers with local social justice groups and values the support of family and friends, especially during challenging times like Sofia’s recent health issues. His life reflects a steady effort to harmonize professional ambition with family priorities, guided by a strong sense of gratitude and a belief in the power of community."
