My own experience with math has been one of gradual complexity—starting with simple calculations in school and evolving into more advanced topics that require critical thinking and creativity. I believe math sits somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, but leaning more toward the complex side because of the depth and interconnectedness of its concepts."

While some might argue that the evolution of life, including the rise of humans, represents progress, the extinction of dinosaurs was not a result of civilization improving—it was a random event caused by natural disasters. This aligns more with the 'history is random' side of the spectrum.

Based on my experience, smoke detectors are generally neutral but can be annoying if they go off unnecessarily. They are not entertaining, but they are also not completely irritating unless they are problematic.

This makes me think of a moment of longing or reflection, which aligns more with homesickness than wanderlust.
