            "BFI-10_1": "Based on Miguel's interview, he appears to be someone who values community and has strong relationships with his family, friends, and community members. He speaks about the importance of giving back to the community and being involved in various activities, which suggests he is comfortable in social situations. Additionally, his description of his family, community, and work environment indicates he enjoys interacting with people. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would see himself as very reserved.",

He has overcome significant challenges and has been fortunate to receive a lot of support and encouragement.

While he doesn't mention engaging in artistic activities, he does talk about his dedication to work, community service, and his family. This suggests he might not identify himself as particularly artistic, but also not as someone with no interest in art whatsoever.

          "raw_responses": {
            "REI_1": "Based on Miguel's story, he grew up in a challenging environment and faced significant obstacles in his early life. Despite these difficulties, he managed to secure a scholarship and pursue higher education, which indicates some level of problem-solving skills and determination. However, he has also faced various stressors and challenges in his professional and personal life, which might suggest that he finds certain aspects of problem-solving challenging. Given that he acknowledges the importance of support systems and community involvement in his life, it's likely that he recognizes his limitations in handling complicated problems but doesn't consider himself completely unable to do so.",
            "REI_2": "Based on Miguel's background and the interview, he doesn't seem to have faced significant challenges with logical analysis. He grew up in a rough neighborhood and had to work hard to get to where he is now, but there's no indication that he struggled with logical reasoning. In fact, his success in securing a scholarship and his current job at a tech startup suggest he has the skills to handle logical analysis. Therefore, it's more likely that he would choose a lower number, indicating he is not very good at these kinds of problems.",
            "REI_3": "Based on Miguel's interview, he doesn't seem to emphasize analytical thinking as a core skill or preference. He describes himself as someone who has relied on support and community rather than deep analytical skills. His focus on giving back and his willingness to trust others and seek help suggests he leans more towards trusting his intuition and the support of others. This makes '1' a more fitting choice for him.",
            "REI_4": "Based on the interview, Miguel describes himself as someone who relies on support systems and community involvement, indicating a more spontaneous and less analytical approach to decision-making. He mentions that his teacher and community organizations helped him make important choices, suggesting he values external support and doesn't necessarily rely on his own careful reasoning.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Miguel seems to have experienced significant stress and pressure, particularly with the launch of his new product and increased community commitments. However, he has also been actively working on coping strategies such as journaling, mindfulness, and attending yoga classes, which suggests he is trying to manage his stress more effectively. He acknowledges that he has felt more stressed in recent months but has been implementing strategies to cope with it. Given his efforts to manage stress and the fact that he recognizes the challenges, but is actively working on them, it is likely that he would not completely agree with the statement that he doesn't reason well under pressure.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Miguel appears to be a reflective and grounded individual who values education and hard work. He has faced numerous challenges, but his persistence and determination suggest he has a strong work ethic and likely possesses a good deal of logical thinking skills, even if he doesn't overtly claim to be exceptional. However, he is not overly boastful, and the interview shows he values the support he has received rather than highlighting his own abilities. Given this, it's reasonable to predict that he would lean towards a moderate confidence level, but not an extremely high one.",
            "REI_7": "Given Miguel's background and his current job at a tech startup where he manages projects and collaborates with teams, it suggests he has strong analytical and logical skills. Additionally, his commitment to giving back and community involvement indicates a well-rounded personality that includes logical thinking. However, he also mentions experiencing stress and anxiety, which could slightly impact his self-assessment. Nonetheless, his professional role suggests he leans towards the upper end of logical thinking.",
            "REI_8": "Given Miguel's reflections on his life, it's clear that he values perseverance and giving back, which suggests a thoughtful and reflective nature. He mentions focusing on coping strategies and managing stress through mindfulness and journaling, indicating that he values careful thinking and planning. Additionally, his work as a project manager at a tech startup requires him to think through complex tasks and decisions carefully, further supporting the idea that he values thorough thought and planning.",
            "REI_9": "Based on Miguel's background and his emphasis on the importance of education and problem-solving, it's reasonable to assume that he would find logic to be a useful tool in solving problems. His experience with applying for scholarships and navigating educational and community challenges suggests a comfort with logical thinking and analytical problem-solving. Furthermore, his current job at a tech startup requires him to manage projects and collaborate with teams, both of which likely involve using logical reasoning to achieve goals.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Miguel appears to be someone who values clear reasoning and has experienced moments where his decisions were guided by thoughtful analysis. For example, he talks about how his teacher encouraged him to apply for a scholarship, which led to a significant turning point. This suggests that he appreciates having clear, explainable reasons for his decisions."
