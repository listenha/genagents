            "REI_9": "Based on Miguel's background and the challenges he has faced, particularly the pivotal moment in high school when a scholarship opened doors for him due to his teacher's encouragement, it suggests he values guidance and support in problem-solving. However, his career at a tech startup and his commitment to giving back through community involvement indicate he is capable and confident in using logical reasoning. Given his current successful position and the importance of problem-solving in his work, a 4 or 5 seems fitting, but considering his appreciation for support systems, a 4 might be more accurate.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Miguel seems like someone who values reason and logic, especially when it comes to his educational and career path. He describes his decision to apply for the scholarship as a combination of an opportunity presented to him and support from his teacher and parents. This suggests that he is likely to have clear reasons for his decisions and to be able to explain them. Additionally, his commitment to community service and giving back indicates a thoughtful approach to his actions. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that he would choose a higher number on this scale."
