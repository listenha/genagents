A pivotal moment came in high school when a teacher encouraged him to apply for a scholarship, leading to a transformative opportunity that opened doors to higher education and a career at a tech startup. Now married to Maria, a social work student, Miguel balances his full-time job with community involvement, including organizing workshops for youth and running a small fund to support local students. His life is guided by a deep sense of gratitude and a commitment to giving back, rooted in the support he received growing up. He navigates the tension between career demands and family aspirations, striving to build a stable future while staying connected to his cultural roots and the community that raised him."
