Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMiguel Santos: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in San Francisco, though my parents are originally from the Philippines. Growing up, we lived in a small apartment in Pacific Heights, which was a pretty rough neighborhood at the time. My parents worked hard but didn't have much formal education, both finishing high school. They managed to scrape by, and it was tough, especially when I was younger. My mom had to work multiple jobs, often coming home late, while my dad tried to help out with whatever he could. Despite the challenges, they always made sure I knew that education was the key to a better life.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMiguel Santos: One such moment came when I was in high school. My parents had always emphasized the importance of education, but it was still tough for them to afford private tutoring or extra resources. However, one day, my math teacher noticed how much I enjoyed problem-solving and suggested that I apply for a scholarship program offered by a local university. At first, I was skeptical; I thought I wasn't good enough. But with my teacher's encouragement and my parents' support, I applied and was surprisingly accepted. That scholarship not only covered my tuition but also provided me with a stipend for living expenses. It was a turning point because it opened doors to opportunities I never imagined possible. From that moment on, I was determined to make the most of my education and give back to my community.\n\n",

It wasn't just something that happened to me; it was a result of the support system I had around me. That experience taught me the power of persistence and the importance of seeking help when needed. It also solidified my belief in the transformative power of education.\n\n",

Additionally, my church and other religious groups often offer support and resources, especially for students in need.

Rent is our biggest expense, followed by groceries and utilities. We also try to save a portion of our income, though it can be challenging with everything going on. Last month, we spent quite a bit on our car maintenance since we've been using it a lot for work and community events.

    "content": "Completing this interview and sharing my life story has been both humbling and enlightening. Reflecting on my journey from a rough neighborhood in San Francisco to the current success and stability I enjoy, I realize how much the support of my family, teachers, and community has shaped who I am today. The interview highlighted the importance of perseverance, education, and giving back, values that have been instilled in me from a young age. It's clear that the challenges I faced, such as the financial struggles and the crossroads I encountered in high school, were pivotal moments that redirected my path. Now, as I look ahead, I am committed to paying forward the support I received, whether through my work at the tech startup, community events, or simply by being there for my partner and future family. This reflection serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of my past experiences and the impact they have on my present and future.",
