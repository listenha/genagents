            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Alyssa seems to value the support of her community and connections, which suggests she has a certain level of comfort in social situations. However, the fact that she appreciates the support of her mom and friends indicates she might not be extremely outgoing. Therefore, she likely sees herself as somewhat reserved but not to a strong degree.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Alyssa seems to have a balanced view of people. She values the support and connections she has, especially from her mother and her community, which suggests she is not overly skeptical. However, she also works in a demanding and sometimes emotionally taxing profession, which might make her more cautious in trusting others. Nonetheless, her willingness to join support groups and engage in community activities indicates a generally positive outlook and trust in people. Therefore, she is more likely to lean towards a moderate level of trust.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Alyssa's description of her life and her responses in the interview, it seems unlikely that she would see herself as someone who tends to be lazy. She describes herself as someone who works full-time, volunteers, and actively seeks to improve her mental health and financial situation. These actions suggest a level of motivation and initiative that does not align with the idea of being lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Alyssa has shared that she struggles with anxiety and has sought therapy to manage her mental health. She also mentioned that stress is a regular part of her life due to the demanding nature of her job as a social worker and her studies. However, she has taken steps to develop coping mechanisms, such as journaling, joining a support group, and meditating. Despite these challenges, she has shown resilience and a willingness to seek support, which suggests she is not completely overwhelmed by stress. Therefore, it seems more likely that she would rate herself as someone who handles stress well, albeit with some room for improvement.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Alyssa Coleman seems to value her connections and support systems, but there's no mention of her engaging in artistic activities. She focuses more on her work as a social worker, her community involvement, and her support network. There's no indication that she has artistic interests, and she doesn't mention any hobbies that fall into that category. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that she would agree more with the statement that she has few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Alyssa Coleman has described herself as someone who enjoys social interactions and has built a strong support network of friends and colleagues. She mentions participating in community events, joining a local support group, and engaging in social media to connect with others. These details suggest she is sociable and enjoys being around people. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that she would choose a higher number on the scale.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Alyssa appears to be a caring and understanding person who values supportive relationships. She emphasizes the importance of resilience and the value of a supportive work environment, which suggests that she is more likely to be patient and understanding with others rather than quick to find fault. Her focus on community and helping others aligns more with the qualities of someone who doesn't tend to find fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on Alyssa's interview, she seems to value thoroughness and reliability in her work. She mentions that her role as a social worker is demanding but fulfilling, and she focuses on providing comprehensive support to the youth she works with. Additionally, she talks about the importance of building relationships and empowering young people, indicating a thorough and thoughtful approach. These traits suggest that Alyssa sees herself as someone who does a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Alyssa Coleman has mentioned experiencing anxiety in the past, particularly with her job and personal life. She has sought therapy and joined a support group to manage her anxiety, indicating that she does experience nervousness and stress. However, she has also developed coping mechanisms, which suggests she is not constantly overwhelmed by anxiety. Given this balance, she seems more aligned with choosing a moderate score between 2 and 4, but leaning slightly towards the higher end of nervousness.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on Alyssa's responses, she seems to value concrete experiences and supports, such as her current job and the community connections she has. She also mentioned that she enjoys outdoor activities and connecting with nature, which suggests a preference for tangible experiences over purely imaginative ones. However, the internship experience and her desire to make a difference in the lives of others indicate that she does have some capacity for imagination and creativity, even if it's not her primary focus."

While she is not explicitly described as having a highly intuitive personality, her experiences and the support she has received from her community suggest she values understanding others.

Her work as a social worker involves helping others navigate challenges, which suggests she has some problem-solving skills. However, she also mentioned feeling the stress of her demanding job and the need to manage her health and finances. Given this balance, it's reasonable to assume she would not rate herself as extremely poor at solving complex problems, but also not at the highest end of the scale. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems most appropriate.",

However, there is no specific mention of her struggling with logical reasoning or problem-solving skills.

            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Alyssa seems to value emotional and interpersonal connections over strict analytical thinking. She has described her work as fulfilling and rewarding, emphasizing the impact she makes rather than breaking down problems analytically.

She has also mentioned that her recent health issues, such as backache and anxiety, have affected her ability to manage stress.

            "REI_7": "From the interview, Alyssa describes herself as someone who has faced various challenges in her life and relies on her ability to work hard and find solutions.

            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Alyssa Coleman describes herself as someone who is committed to helping others and has pursued a career in social work. While she mentions that her highest degree is only high school, she has managed to navigate her career and personal life successfully. Her resilience and problem-solving skills in her current job suggest that she is capable of handling logical and analytical tasks, even if it's not her primary strength. Therefore, it seems unlikely that she would strongly agree with this statement.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Alyssa described herself as someone who balances work and personal life, often dealing with emotional and interpersonal challenges. She seems to value community and support, which suggests a more holistic and less analytical approach to problem-solving. Additionally, her focus on helping others and her work in social services indicates a preference for empathetic and less analytical methods. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume she would lean towards the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_4": "Based on the interview, Alyssa describes herself as someone who feels like she doesn't always reason things out carefully. She mentions that she's trying to manage stress and anxiety, which might make her more prone to making decisions based on her current emotional state rather than a careful analysis. Additionally, her description of her job as demanding and the need to balance work and personal life suggests she often has to make decisions quickly and may not always take the time to reason things out thoroughly.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Alyssa has faced significant challenges and stressors, such as financial pressures, health issues, and the demanding nature of her job. However, she has also developed coping mechanisms like therapy, mindfulness, and support groups, which suggest she is working on managing her stress and improving her ability to reason under pressure. While she has acknowledged struggling with anxiety and backaches, she has shown resilience and support from her network, indicating she is not entirely unable to reason well under pressure.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Alyssa described herself as having a moderate political view and a balanced approach to life. She does not seem to have an overinflated sense of her logical abilities, nor does she appear to undervalue them. Given her balanced perspective and the fact that she is a social worker, which often requires empathy and interpersonal skills rather than purely logical reasoning, she is more likely to rate herself moderately rather than extremely high.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Alyssa seems to have a balanced approach to problem-solving and decision-making. While she values her ability to help others and has a clear sense of purpose, the interview does not suggest that she predominantly relies on logical reasoning over other cognitive processes. She has described her work as fulfilling and rewarding, which implies a holistic approach rather than solely relying on logic. Therefore, a moderate score seems fitting.",
            "REI_8": "Based on the interview, Alyssa is described as a social worker with a moderate political view and a balanced approach to her work and personal life. She seems to value careful thought and planning, as evidenced by her commitment to her career and her efforts to manage her finances and maintain a work-life balance. This suggests she would not choose the lowest end of the scale, indicating that she does have no problem thinking things through carefully.",
            "REI_9": "Based on the interview, Alyssa Coleman seems to have a balanced approach to problem-solving. She describes her work as demanding but rewarding, indicating she has developed strong problem-solving skills. However, she also mentions that her job can be emotionally taxing, suggesting that sometimes she may rely on other methods beyond pure logic to manage her tasks. Given her overall positive outlook and the fact that she feels she's making a difference in her work, it's reasonable to assume she leans towards using logic but doesn't necessarily rely solely on it.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Alyssa is described as a social worker with a moderate political view and independent leaning towards democrats. She seems to have a clear sense of purpose and values, particularly in her career choice. She reflects on how her past experiences and the internship opportunity led her to pursue social work, indicating a thoughtful and considered approach to her career path. This suggests she is likely to have clear, explainable reasons for her decisions."

She does not consistently describe herself as relaxed or someone who handles stress effortlessly, which suggests she would not score a 5. However, she is actively working on improving her stress management, which might place her somewhere in the middle. Given her self-awareness and efforts to manage stress, a score of 3 seems most accurate.",

            "BFI-10_9": "Alyssa mentioned experiencing anxiety, especially during stressful times at work and in her personal life. She also noted that she started seeing a therapist to help manage her anxiety, which indicates she does recognize and experience nervousness.
