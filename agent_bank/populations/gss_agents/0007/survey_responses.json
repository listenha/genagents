            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Alyssa seems to value the support of her community and connections, which suggests she has a certain level of comfort in social situations. However, the fact that she appreciates the support of her mom and friends indicates she might not be extremely outgoing. Therefore, she likely sees herself as somewhat reserved but not to a strong degree.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Alyssa seems to have a balanced view of people. She values the support and connections she has, especially from her mother and her community, which suggests she is not overly skeptical. However, she also works in a demanding and sometimes emotionally taxing profession, which might make her more cautious in trusting others. Nonetheless, her willingness to join support groups and engage in community activities indicates a generally positive outlook and trust in people. Therefore, she is more likely to lean towards a moderate level of trust.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Alyssa's description of her life and her responses in the interview, it seems unlikely that she would see herself as someone who tends to be lazy. She describes herself as someone who works full-time, volunteers, and actively seeks to improve her mental health and financial situation. These actions suggest a level of motivation and initiative that does not align with the idea of being lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Alyssa has shared that she struggles with anxiety and has sought therapy to manage her mental health. She also mentioned that stress is a regular part of her life due to the demanding nature of her job as a social worker and her studies. However, she has taken steps to develop coping mechanisms, such as journaling, joining a support group, and meditating. Despite these challenges, she has shown resilience and a willingness to seek support, which suggests she is not completely overwhelmed by stress. Therefore, it seems more likely that she would rate herself as someone who handles stress well, albeit with some room for improvement.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Alyssa Coleman seems to value her connections and support systems, but there's no mention of her engaging in artistic activities. She focuses more on her work as a social worker, her community involvement, and her support network. There's no indication that she has artistic interests, and she doesn't mention any hobbies that fall into that category. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that she would agree more with the statement that she has few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Alyssa Coleman has described herself as someone who enjoys social interactions and has built a strong support network of friends and colleagues. She mentions participating in community events, joining a local support group, and engaging in social media to connect with others. These details suggest she is sociable and enjoys being around people. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that she would choose a higher number on the scale.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Alyssa appears to be a caring and understanding person who values supportive relationships. She emphasizes the importance of resilience and the value of a supportive work environment, which suggests that she is more likely to be patient and understanding with others rather than quick to find fault. Her focus on community and helping others aligns more with the qualities of someone who doesn't tend to find fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on Alyssa's interview, she seems to value thoroughness and reliability in her work. She mentions that her role as a social worker is demanding but fulfilling, and she focuses on providing comprehensive support to the youth she works with. Additionally, she talks about the importance of building relationships and empowering young people, indicating a thorough and thoughtful approach. These traits suggest that Alyssa sees herself as someone who does a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Alyssa Coleman has mentioned experiencing anxiety in the past, particularly with her job and personal life. She has sought therapy and joined a support group to manage her anxiety, indicating that she does experience nervousness and stress. However, she has also developed coping mechanisms, which suggests she is not constantly overwhelmed by anxiety. Given this balance, she seems more aligned with choosing a moderate score between 2 and 4, but leaning slightly towards the higher end of nervousness.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on Alyssa's responses, she seems to value concrete experiences and supports, such as her current job and the community connections she has. She also mentioned that she enjoys outdoor activities and connecting with nature, which suggests a preference for tangible experiences over purely imaginative ones. However, the internship experience and her desire to make a difference in the lives of others indicate that she does have some capacity for imagination and creativity, even if it's not her primary focus."

While she is not explicitly described as having a highly intuitive personality, her experiences and the support she has received from her community suggest she values understanding others.

Her work as a social worker involves helping others navigate challenges, which suggests she has some problem-solving skills. However, she also mentioned feeling the stress of her demanding job and the need to manage her health and finances. Given this balance, it's reasonable to assume she would not rate herself as extremely poor at solving complex problems, but also not at the highest end of the scale. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems most appropriate.",

However, there is no specific mention of her struggling with logical reasoning or problem-solving skills.

            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Alyssa seems to value emotional and interpersonal connections over strict analytical thinking. She has described her work as fulfilling and rewarding, emphasizing the impact she makes rather than breaking down problems analytically.

She has also mentioned that her recent health issues, such as backache and anxiety, have affected her ability to manage stress.

            "REI_7": "From the interview, Alyssa describes herself as someone who has faced various challenges in her life and relies on her ability to work hard and find solutions.

            "REI_7": "Based on Alyssa's responses, she seems to value practical solutions and seems to approach problems methodically. Her career as a social worker, which involves assessing situations and creating individualized plans, suggests a logical mindset.

While she has described herself as making a positive impact and having supportive relationships, she has also shown moments of needing to take breaks and prioritize her mental health. This suggests she is not entirely comfortable in all social settings but also does not fit the description of someone who is extremely reserved. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems most appropriate.",

However, she has also mentioned taking steps to manage her stress, such as seeing a therapist, practicing mindfulness, and joining a support group.

Therefore, she is more likely to fall somewhere in the middle to slightly above the midpoint.",

She doesn't mention any specific artistic interests, and her description of her life focuses more on her work, community involvement, and personal challenges.

She mentioned participating in a support group for social workers, which indicates she is aware of her emotional state and takes steps to manage it. This suggests she is not completely unaffected by nervousness but also not overly prone to it in most situations.",
            "BFI-10_10": "From the interview, Alyssa described her life and work in a straightforward, practical manner. She didn't mention any inclination towards creativity or imagination beyond her work with youth development. She focuses more on practical solutions and support rather than imaginative thinking.

While she has faced challenges and has had to learn coping mechanisms, there is no indication that she avoids or struggles with complex problems. She seems to handle demanding tasks and is part of a supportive work environment that helps her manage stress. Therefore, it is more likely that she would rate herself higher on this scale.",

She doesn't seem overly confident in her analytical abilities, especially given the challenges she has faced, like the backache and anxiety.

She describes her work and life in terms of relationships and support, indicating a preference for intuitive thinking.

            "REI_5": "Based on Alyssa's description of her experiences, she seems to have faced significant challenges, including financial struggles and health issues. Despite these pressures, she has managed to maintain a steady work schedule and engage in various support mechanisms. However, the internship experience and the recent health issues suggest that she does experience some difficulty reasoning under pressure. She acknowledges that the backache and anxiety have made her realize the importance of having a financial buffer, indicating that she can be affected by stress. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that she would fall somewhere in the middle of the range, closer to 3 or 4, but leaning slightly towards 1 due to her acknowledgment of occasional difficulties.",
