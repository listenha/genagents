Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAlyssa Coleman: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia, in a small hospital just off the interstate. My parents were both from Congo but met here in the States. They got married when I was a baby, but things didn't work out. My parents divorced when I was around five, and we moved to a different neighborhood within the same city. I remember my mom working hard at a local diner to support us. She always made sure we had food on the table and clothes on our backs, even though times were tough. My dad wasn't really around much after the divorce; he had his own struggles. I went to public schools in Atlanta and was fortunate to have some really good teachers who kept pushing me to do better. I graduated high school with a decent GPA and got into a community college nearby. I've been working full-time since then, trying to save up some money and get a bit ahead.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAlyssa Coleman: There was one significant moment that stands out. It happened during my sophomore year of high school when I started thinking seriously about my future. My guidance counselor suggested I apply for a summer internship at a local nonprofit organization focused on youth development. At first, I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the risk, but she convinced me to apply. I got the internship, and it was life-changing. I worked with kids from diverse backgrounds, helping them with homework, organizing activities, and just being a positive influence. It was my first real job, and I learned so much about teamwork, leadership, and making a difference. That experience reinforced my desire to help others and eventually led me to pursue a degree in social work. It's a decision I'm proud of, as it aligns with my values and interests.\n\n",

It wasn't a huge conscious decision, but rather a feeling that I couldn't pass up. Working with those kids, seeing how much impact I could have, was incredibly rewarding. It showed me that I wanted to dedicate my career to helping others, and that's what led me to choose social work. It feels like the right path for me.\n\n",

If not for their encouragement and support, I might not have taken that step. It's amazing how such small nudges can lead to big changes.\n\n",

This experience has deeply influenced my career choices and continues to inspire me to pursue a path that aligns with my values. While I haven't had a partner or children yet, the care and support I experienced through the internship have made me understand the importance of stability and nurturing relationships in my future.

The physical and mental challenges I've faced, particularly the backache and increased anxiety, have significantly impacted my ability to perform at work and manage my personal life. Recognizing these issues and actively seeking support, such as therapy, has been crucial in helping me navigate these difficulties. While the internships and community connections have provided a sense of support, they also highlight the importance of addressing and managing my health proactively. The journey has underscored the necessity of finding sustainable ways to cope with stress and maintain well-being, both for myself and for those around me, such as my mother and friends. This realization reinforces the importance of prioritizing self-care and seeking help when needed, ensuring I can continue to contribute effectively to my community and career.",

Rent is a fixed cost, but I try to keep it affordable by staying in a smaller apartment. Groceries are essential, and I try to plan meals to avoid buying too much processed food. Transportation is tricky since I don't have a car, so I rely on public transit, which adds up. I also had some utility bills and internet fees, but those are relatively stable.

The summer was a bit easier, but with more outdoor activities, my grocery bill increased as I tried to eat healthier. Around the holidays, there were some extra expenses for gifts and parties, but I managed to save by cutting back on non-essential items.

From my childhood in a single-parent household to my current role as a social worker, every experience has contributed to my resilience, values, and aspirations. The support of my mother and the connections I've made throughout my life have been instrumental in guiding me toward a fulfilling career and personal life. The interviews have highlighted the importance of maintaining a balance between work, personal life, and health, and have reinforced the belief that supportive relationships and a sense of purpose are crucial for navigating life's challenges. This reflection serves as a reminder to continue seeking support, prioritizing self-care, and staying true to my values as I move forward in my journey.",
