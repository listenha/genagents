  "agent_profile_summary": "Brian Jackson, a 43-year-old public policy professional from Charleston, South Carolina, has built a life rooted in community and purpose. Growing up in a working-class family, he chose to work with a local nonprofit supporting immigrant communities over a political internship, a decision that shaped his career and values. Now living in the same neighborhood where he grew up, Brian balances a full-time role at Community Roots with a commitment to grassroots activism, community gardening, and maintaining close ties with family and friends. His work focuses on helping low-income families access essential services, a cause he approaches with empathy and a deep understanding of the challenges faced by those in his community. While he values his independence and the stability of his life, Brian also reflects on the tension between staying rooted in his familiar surroundings and the desire to make a broader impact, a balance he continues to navigate with intention and care."
