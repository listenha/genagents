While they were a significant part of Earth's history, they did not contribute to the development of human civilization, and their extinction was not a failure but a natural outcome of environmental and biological factors.

However, I've also seen it be cool when it's done in a relaxed, social setting—like having a beer with friends at a local bar or enjoying a glass of wine with a meal.

I have seen horror movies that were thrilling and engaging, but not so intense that they left me 'scared to death.' At the same time, I have also seen horror movies that were predictable or unoriginal, which could be considered 'bored to death.'
