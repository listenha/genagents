Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMarissa Haddad: My name is Marissa Haddad, and my journey began in a small Syrian village. I was born in the United States, though, and grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan. My parents immigrated here when they were young, and they worked hard to give us a good life. My father pursued a bachelor's degree while working multiple jobs, and my mother managed our household and occasionally worked part-time jobs. Despite not having a college degree herself, she instilled in me the importance of education and hard work. I remember being surrounded by my extended family, who often visited during holidays, bringing with them a mix of Syrian and American traditions.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMarissa Haddad: One such moment came when I was deciding whether to stay in Michigan after high school or move to a different state for college. My parents wanted me to stay close to home, but I felt the urge to explore new places and gain independence. After much consideration, I decided to apply to schools across the country. Eventually, I chose a university in New York City. That decision led me to meet new people, experience a bustling city life, and broaden my horizons. It was a pivotal point that helped shape my identity as someone who values both stability and adventure.\n\n",

I think sometimes decisions are clearer in hindsight, but at the time, it felt like a natural progression. Staying true to myself and pursuing my dreams has always been more important than what others expected of me.\n\n",

Having access to resources like career counseling or mentorship programs could have given me more confidence and clarity.

They'd have breakfast, which might include something simple like cereal or toast, and then head off to school.

I also find that spending time outdoors and engaging in creative activities like painting or writing helps me unwind.

Rent for my apartment is a significant portion of my monthly costs, and I've been fortunate to find a place that fits within my budget. Groceries and other essentials take up another chunk, but I've learned to be mindful of my spending.

The remaining $500 covers miscellaneous expenses like transportation, utilities, and occasional outings with friends.

The moments that stand out are those where I felt compelled to follow my instincts, even when they differed from what others expected. These experiences have taught me the importance of independence and the value of support from others. My journey is a continuous exploration of self and a commitment to living a balanced life that includes both stability and adventure. The interviews have highlighted how my life is deeply intertwined with my family, community, and the dynamic environment of Ann Arbor. Balancing academic pressures with social life is a constant challenge, but the support from my community and the opportunities for personal and professional growth make it worthwhile. Moving forward, I hope to complete my degree with a strong academic foundation and meaningful experiences, and to continue my work with the Syrian-American community.
