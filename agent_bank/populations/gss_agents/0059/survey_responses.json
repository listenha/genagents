            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Marissa has engaged in creative activities like painting or writing to help her unwind and cope with stress. These interests suggest that she has some artistic inclinations, even if they are not her primary focus.

However, she also mentions that she allows herself to be open to opportunities and listens to her instincts rather than overthinking every decision, which indicates a balance between ease and complexity. Given her focus on personal growth and her academic and extracurricular activities, it suggests she is not entirely comfortable with complicated problems but is not completely at a loss with them either.

While she mentions that decisions 'just happened,' she also values personal growth and independence.

She mentions that she allowed herself to be open to opportunities and listen to her instincts, rather than sitting down to plan out every step. This suggests that she is more spontaneous and relies on her gut feeling, which aligns more closely with choosing 1 on this scale.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Marissa seems to have a balanced approach to handling stress and pressure. She acknowledges that she deals with anxiety over deadlines and exams, but she has developed coping mechanisms like mindfulness and therapy.

            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Marissa describes herself as someone who values personal growth and seeks to understand different aspects of life through exploration and instinct. She doesn't explicitly mention being exceptionally good at logical reasoning, but she does discuss her academic pursuits and personal development.

            "REI_9": "Based on the interview, Marissa appears to be a thoughtful and analytical person who values education and has a structured approach to her life. She seems to thrive in environments that require critical thinking and problem-solving, as evidenced by her involvement in various academic and volunteer activities. Her interest in courses like art history and cultural studies, as well as her dedication to improving her language skills, suggests a strong inclination towards logical and methodical approaches to learning and personal development.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Marissa reflects on her decision-making process and mentions that it 'just happened' at times, indicating a more spontaneous approach. However, she also acknowledges the importance of following her instincts and personal aspirations, suggesting she does consider reasons for her decisions, even if not always explicitly stated. Given her balanced view, a score of 3 seems fitting, but leaning slightly towards 4 suggests she often has clear reasons, even if not always explicitly articulated."

She is described as having a 'middle of the road' political view and not being a very strong Democrat, suggesting a balanced perspective. Additionally, she mentions that decisions often 'just happened' rather than being planned out, indicating a more pragmatic and less egotistical approach. This suggests she is unlikely to rate herself as 5, but also doesn't consider herself as far below average in logical thinking.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Marissa describes herself as someone who values both stability and adventure, suggesting she is adaptable and open to different approaches to problem-solving. She also mentions pursuing various academic interests and engaging in creative activities, which indicates a multifaceted mindset rather than solely relying on logic. However, her background in education and her involvement in research and writing suggest a certain level of analytical thinking. Given this balance, it seems more likely that she would lean towards a moderate score, indicating she has a logical mind but also appreciates other ways of thinking.",
            "REI_8": "Based on the interview, Marissa describes herself as someone who allows herself to be open to opportunities and listens to her instincts. This suggests she values intuition and may not always think things through meticulously. However, she also mentions making significant decisions, such as choosing to attend college in New York City, which indicates she does engage in thoughtful consideration. Given this balance, it seems more likely that Marissa would lean towards the middle of the spectrum, indicating she is capable of thoughtful planning but not necessarily always meticulous.",
            "REI_9": "Based on the interview, Marissa describes herself as someone who values independence and follows her instincts, even when they differ from what others expect. This suggests she might not always rely on logic alone, but rather on a combination of intuition and personal judgment. However, given that she has a moderate political view and seems to be thoughtful and reflective, it indicates she does use logical reasoning as part of her problem-solving process.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Marissa describes her decision-making process as following her instincts and valuing personal aspirations over what others expect of her. This suggests that while she does have reasons for her decisions, they are not always explicitly articulated or easily explained. However, she does reflect on her choices and considers their implications, indicating a level of thoughtfulness. Therefore, she is more likely to lean towards the middle of the scale rather than the extremes."

She also mentions valuing stability alongside adventure and being open to new experiences. Given these traits, she seems to lean towards being open and adaptable rather than reserved. Additionally, she has a wide social circle, including friends from college and a tight-knit Syrian-American community, which suggests she is not overly reserved in her social life.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview transcript, Marissa seems to be a moderate individual who values relationships and community support. She has mentioned having a strong support network of family, friends, and community, which suggests she is comfortable with trust. However, she has also talked about her strategies for managing stress and anxiety, indicating she is not overly trusting and prefers to verify situations. Given her balanced approach, she would likely fall closer to the middle of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on the interview, Marissa seems to be quite proactive and dedicated to her studies and various commitments, such as her part-time job and volunteer work. She mentions that she tries to manage her finances carefully, balance her work and studies, and engage in various activities to support her well-being. These traits suggest that she is more likely to see herself as someone who is industrious rather than lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Marissa has experienced stress over the past year, especially around deadlines and exams. However, she has been working on managing it through mindfulness and therapy, and she reports feeling that her stress levels are fairly manageable. She also mentions that she has developed coping strategies like spending time outdoors and engaging in creative activities, which help her unwind. Given this, it seems reasonable to predict that she would rate herself as someone who can handle stress well, but not necessarily someone who is always relaxed in all situations. Therefore, a 3 seems to be the most accurate representation of her self-perception.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Marissa has shown an interest in creative activities like painting or writing as a way to unwind and express herself. She has also been exploring new courses in art history and cultural studies, which indicates a curiosity and appreciation for the arts. These details suggest that she does not identify as someone with few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Marissa describes herself as valuing independence and often being open to opportunities and listening to her instincts. She also mentions having close relationships with her family and friends and participating in various social activities like volunteer work and cultural events. While she does not explicitly describe herself as outgoing, her engagement with her community and the support she receives from her social network suggest she leans towards being sociable and outgoing rather than isolated. Given the context of her life and the support she receives from her community, a score of 3 or 4 seems most fitting, but leaning slightly towards the higher end due to her involvement in social activities.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Marissa seems to value understanding and empathy, especially in her interactions with her community and family. She talks about the importance of support and relationships, suggesting that she is more likely to be understanding and patient rather than quick to find faults. Her emphasis on community involvement and the positive impact of her actions also indicates a more forgiving and understanding outlook.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on the interview, Marissa seems to be someone who values thoroughness and attention to detail. She has described herself as someone who manages her time well, engages in mindfulness practices, and maintains a flexible and supportive work environment. These traits suggest that she is likely to see herself as someone who does a thorough job, rather than someone who rushes through tasks.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Marissa seems to have a balanced view of her stress levels and coping mechanisms. She mentions experiencing some anxiety, especially around deadlines and exams, but she has strategies in place to manage it, such as mindfulness and therapy. This suggests she is not overly nervous all the time but does experience some level of anxiety. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 or 4 would be more fitting, but given the range, a 3 would represent someone who is moderately nervous but manages it well, and a 4 would indicate someone who is somewhat nervous but not consistently so. Since Marissa has strategies in place and acknowledges occasional anxiety, a 3 seems slightly more appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Marissa seems to be someone who engages in creative activities like painting and writing. She also describes herself as valuing independence and the value of support from others, which suggests she is open to new ideas and enjoys creative endeavors. These traits align more closely with someone who sees themselves as imaginative."

She mentioned that she finds social media supportive during tough times and that she reaches out to friends and family for emotional support.

While she has a supportive network, she emphasizes that her decisions are often made by following her own path.

She also mentions that she has a close network of friends and is involved in various social activities, suggesting she interacts with a diverse group of people.

Therefore, it seems more likely that she would not strongly agree with the statement of being poor at solving complicated problems.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Marissa seems to be a moderate individual with a balanced view of her abilities. She is open to the idea of her limitations, but does not appear to have a strong conviction that she is poor at logical analysis. Her reflections suggest she values her independence and seeks support when needed, indicating she is neither overly confident nor overly uncertain about her problem-solving abilities.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Marissa seems to value independence and making decisions based on her instincts rather than necessarily following a structured, analytical thought process.

While she does acknowledge stress, she has developed coping mechanisms like mindfulness and spending time outdoors to manage it. Her ability to balance her academic and personal life suggests that she can reason well under pressure, although she may not rank herself as highly as someone who excels in high-stress situations. Given her adaptive strategies and overall resilience, a moderate score of 3 seems fitting.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Marissa seems to be a well-rounded individual who values both stability and personal growth. While she doesn't mention having exceptional logical reasoning skills, she does speak about exploring different paths and relying on her instincts. This suggests she values her own judgment and problem-solving abilities but doesn't necessarily claim to be much better than others. Therefore, a score of 3 or slightly above 3 seems most fitting, but given the options, a 2 or 3 is more appropriate.",

While she has a strong emphasis on education and personal growth, there is no explicit mention of her excelling in purely logical or analytical fields.

She mentions that she doesn't sit down and plan out every step but rather allows herself to be open to opportunities and listens to her instincts. However, she also acknowledges that sometimes decisions are clearer in hindsight. This suggests that while she values clarity in her reasons for decisions, she doesn't always have a fully articulated rationale for every choice she makes. Therefore, a score of 3 seems most appropriate, but since we must choose between 1 and 5, a 3 would lean closer to 5 given her recognition of her decision-making process, even if it's not always fully explained."

However, she does mention facing academic pressures and stress, indicating she is not entirely unchallenged by complex problems. Given these factors, a moderate response seems fitting.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Marissa seems to be a balanced and thoughtful individual who values education and personal growth. She mentions being open to new experiences and balancing different aspects of her life, which suggests she is capable of handling various types of challenges. However, she also talks about feeling overwhelmed by academic pressures and the need to balance work and personal life, indicating that she may not find logical analysis as straightforward as some others.

She mentions that she didn't sit down and plan out every step when making significant decisions, suggesting a preference for spontaneity and intuition over careful reasoning. This aligns more closely with the description of someone who would choose 1.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Marissa has experienced academic pressures, such as final exams and thesis work, but she has also mentioned that she has developed strategies to manage her stress and anxiety, such as mindfulness and talking to a therapist. This suggests she has some ability to reason well under pressure, even if it's not always easy for her. Given her proactive approach to managing stress, it seems unlikely that she would rate herself as struggling significantly under pressure.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Marissa describes herself as someone who values both stability and adventure, and she has shown a willingness to explore new places and experiences. While she values logical thinking and has a moderate political stance, she doesn't seem to emphasize exceptional logical abilities. Her focus on personal growth and community involvement suggests she might not view herself as exceptionally good at logical thinking compared to others.",

She mentions engaging in various intellectual pursuits such as studying, writing, and volunteering, which suggests she is comfortable with logical reasoning and problem-solving. Her commitment to education and her involvement in activities that require critical thinking further support this assessment.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Marissa seems to value reflection and considers her choices thoughtfully. She mentions that her decisions 'just happened' but also notes that she allowed herself to be open to opportunities and listened to her instincts. This suggests she doesn't always have a clear, step-by-step explanation for her choices, but she does consider them carefully. Therefore, a score of 3 or slightly higher seems fitting, but given the range, 4 seems most appropriate as it aligns with her thoughtful but not overly analytical approach."

However, her emphasis on intuition, cultural heritage, and emotional support suggests she may not rely solely on logic, placing her in the middle range.",
            "REI_10": "Marissa reflects on her decisions as being guided by her instincts and personal values, such as family, education, and giving back to her community. While she acknowledges making decisions based on her feelings and values, she also mentions that some choices felt 'natural' or 'just happened.' This suggests that while she does have reasons for her decisions, they are not always fully articulated or analyzed in a structured way. She also mentions not planning out every step, which aligns more with a middle or lower score on this scale."
