My experience with math has been varied — I enjoy the logic and patterns it offers, and while I find it rewarding, I also recognize its complexity, especially in areas like data analysis and financial modeling. Given this, I would place math somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, acknowledging both its foundational simplicity and its potential for complexity."

For example, my daughter Lily finds beauty in simple things like a rainbow or a flower, which are subjective to her. At the same time, there are objective elements, like the structure of a building or the composition of a painting, that many people might agree on. However, the emotional and personal connection to beauty feels more significant to me, especially in how it shapes our experiences and values."

While there's a hint of being in a new city, the imagery of candlelight suggests a moment of calm or nostalgia. For me, this leans more toward homesickness because the candlelight could symbolize a longing for warmth, familiarity, or a connection to the past.
