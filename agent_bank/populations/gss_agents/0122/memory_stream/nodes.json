    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nEric Chen: I was born in Shanghai, China, but I moved to the United States when I was five years old with my parents, who were both working professionals. Growing up in the Pacific region, specifically in a small town in Washington State, I was surrounded by a tight-knit Asian community, which played a big role in shaping my cultural identity. My parents always emphasized the importance of education, even though they didn't have the highest levels of formal education themselves. My father only finished high school, and my mother went to an associate's program, but they worked hard to provide for our family and support my sister and me. I remember my mother working multiple jobs at times, and my father running a small business on the side. Despite the challenges, we always had a strong family bond. I was raised in a Buddhist household, but as I got older, I found myself drawn to Protestant teachings, which I now practice. I moved to San Francisco for college, where I pursued a graduate degree in business. It was there that I met my wife, and we've been married for about five years now. We've built a life together here, and I'm currently working full-time as a financial analyst. Even though I was born abroad, I've always considered myself an American at heart, and I'm proud to be a U.S. citizen. I also speak Mandarin fluently, which has been both a blessing and a challenge in navigating my professional and personal life.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nEric Chen: One of the most pivotal moments in my life was when I decided to move to San Francisco for my graduate studies. At the time, I had just finished my undergraduate degree in economics back in Washington, and I was faced with a choice: stay in the Pacific Northwest and take a job at a local firm, or move to San Francisco to pursue a master's in business administration. My parents were hesitant because they didn't see the immediate financial benefit, and they worried about me being so far from home. But I felt a deep pull toward San Francisco \u2014 not just for the academic opportunities, but for the sense of possibility it represented. I remember sitting with my mother one evening, telling her how much I wanted to grow, to challenge myself, and to build a future that was more than just stability. She looked at me for a long time and finally said, 'If this is what your heart is telling you, then go.' That decision changed everything. It was in San Francisco that I met my wife, that I learned to navigate a more diverse and fast-paced professional environment, and that I truly began to see myself as an American \u2014 not just someone who had moved here, but someone who belonged here. Looking back, I know that crossroads was the moment I started becoming the person I am today.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nEric Chen: I think, in that moment, it was a conscious choice \u2014 but not one I made alone. My parents had sacrificed so much to give me the chance to have a better life, and I felt responsible to make the most of it. Still, there was something deeper, something almost instinctual, that made me know I had to take that step. I wasn't just choosing a city or a degree; I was choosing a version of myself. I remember standing on the steps of the university for the first time, looking out over the city, and thinking, 'This is where I'm meant to be.' It wasn't just about opportunity \u2014 it was about identity, about becoming someone who could stand on my own two feet and build a life that felt authentic. I think, in the end, it was a combination of intention and intuition \u2014 a choice made with purpose, but also with trust in something bigger than myself.\n\n",

When I was making that decision to move to San Francisco, my uncle, who had already settled here a few years earlier, was a huge support. He not only helped me find temporary housing but also introduced me to people in the business community who became mentors. He believed in me even before I fully believed in myself. That kind of support made all the difference. I also remember reaching out to a local organization that helped international students transition into graduate programs. They provided resources on everything from housing to cultural adaptation, which was incredibly valuable. It reminded me that while we often think of these moments as solely our own, they're usually shaped by the people and systems around us. I'm grateful for those who helped me take that step \u2014 they were like the bridge that connected me to the life I now have.\n\n",

Do you have a partner, or children?\n\nEric Chen: Yes, I'm married to my wife, Sarah, and we have a daughter named Lily, who's four years old. Sarah is a school counselor, and she works in one of the public schools here in San Francisco. We met during my first year in graduate school \u2014 she was a fellow student, majoring in education. We bonded over our shared belief in the importance of community and education, and it wasn't long before we started dating. Our relationship has been built on mutual support and shared values. We both work hard, but we also make sure to prioritize family time. Lily is a bright and curious child, and she's already showing an interest in numbers and patterns, which I find fascinating. I like to think I've passed on some of my love for economics and problem-solving to her, even if she's only four. Sarah and I also have a small but close-knit group of friends that we've known for years, and we often gather for dinners or weekend outings. It's important to me to create a stable and loving environment for Lily, one where she feels safe, supported, and encouraged to explore her interests. Being a father has changed me in ways I never expected \u2014 it's made me more patient, more thoughtful, and more aware of the responsibilities that come with shaping someone else's life. I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\n",

The moment I chose to move to San Francisco for graduate school was a turning point \u2014 it wasn't just about education, but about who I wanted to become. I'm grateful for the support of my uncle and the local organizations that helped me transition, because I know I wouldn't be where I am today without them.

My parents are still living in Washington State, and while we don't see each other as often as I'd like, we stay in close contact through phone calls and video chats. My sister is a few years younger than me, and she's currently studying nursing at a community college. She's always been the more adventurous one of us, and I admire her for taking on such a demanding path. Our relationship has always been strong \u2014 even though we've grown up in different parts of the country, we share a deep bond. As for my uncle, he's been like a second father to me. He was the one who first encouraged me to think about moving to San Francisco, and his support didn't stop there. He's always been there for me, whether it was helping me with my career or just offering a listening ear when I needed it.

Are there people outside of your family who are important to you?\n\nEric Chen: Outside of my family, there are a few friends who have been incredibly important to me over the years. One of them is David, a childhood friend from Washington who moved to San Francisco a few years after I did. We met again through a mutual friend at a local caf\u00e9, and since then, we've kept in touch. David works in tech, and while our careers are very different, he's always been someone I can count on for honest advice and good company. He's also the one who introduced me to the running community here, and I've been able to stay active and meet a lot of like-minded people through that. Then there's Rachel, a former colleague from my time at the financial firm I worked at after graduate school. She and I had a very different career path \u2014 she went into nonprofit work, focusing on education for underprivileged youth. I admire her passion and dedication, and we've stayed friends even as our lives have taken us in different directions. These people, along with the mentors I've had over the years, have helped shape who I am. They've been there during the good times and the tough ones, and I'm grateful for their presence in my life.\n\n",

Tell me all about the neighborhood and area in which you are living now.\n\nEric Chen: I live in a neighborhood in San Francisco called the Mission District. It's a vibrant and diverse area with a rich cultural history, and I've come to love the energy it brings. The streets are lined with colorful murals, and there's always something happening \u2014 from street performers to local food trucks. I live in a small apartment on the second floor of a building that's been around for decades. It's not the biggest place, but it's cozy and feels like home. The neighborhood has a strong sense of community, and I've made a lot of friends here through local events and gatherings. There's also a great mix of businesses \u2014 from independent bookstores to family-owned restaurants \u2014 which makes it feel like a place where everyone has a story to tell. One of the things I appreciate most about living here is the access to public transportation. I can walk to work, which is just a few blocks away, and I'm never too far from a park or a caf\u00e9 where I can grab a quick bite or catch up with friends. Even though the city can be fast-paced and sometimes overwhelming, the Mission District has a warmth to it that keeps me grounded. It's a place where I feel connected to both my roots and my future.\n\n",

I've never had any serious issues, and the people I've met \u2014 neighbors, shopkeepers, even the baristas at my favorite caf\u00e9 \u2014 have always been friendly and welcoming. There's a sense of familiarity and mutual respect that makes me feel like I belong. I also take some basic precautions, like keeping my doors locked and being aware of my environment, but I don't let fear dictate how I live. For me, safety is about both the physical space and the people in it, and I think the Mission District has a good balance of both.\n\n",

Tell me about what it\u2019s been like for you living here.\n\nEric Chen: Living here has had its ups and downs, just like anywhere else. On the positive side, the Mission District has given me a sense of belonging that I didn't always feel when I first moved here. The diversity of the neighborhood is something I truly appreciate \u2014 I love being surrounded by people from all walks of life, each with their own stories and traditions. It's inspiring to see how different cultures come together here, and I've learned so much from my neighbors and friends. The access to good schools, public transportation, and a variety of cultural and professional opportunities has been a huge plus for me, especially as a father. I can take Lily to the park, grab a bite at a local restaurant, or even attend a community event without having to go too far. That convenience makes a big difference in daily life. On the downside, the cost of living here is definitely a challenge. Rent is high, and even with my salary, it's always a balancing act to make sure we're saving for the future while still enjoying the present. There are also times when the pace of the city feels overwhelming \u2014 the noise, the crowds, the constant motion. I've had to learn how to slow down, to find moments of peace in the chaos. But overall, I feel lucky to be here. This neighborhood has been a part of my journey, and I believe it's helped shape the person I've become.\n\n",

I start my week early \u2014 usually around 6:30 a.m., when I wake up, make sure Lily is up and fed, and we have a quick breakfast together. I drop her off at daycare, then head to work, which is about a 15-minute walk from home. My job as a financial analyst keeps me busy, so most days involve meetings, data analysis, and client calls. I try to leave work by 6 p.m. so I can be home for dinner with Sarah and Lily. On weekdays, we usually have a simple meal, and then I help Lily with her bedtime routine. On the weekends, things are a bit more relaxed. I love taking Lily to the park, especially in the mornings when it's quieter. We often go to the Mission Playground, and I enjoy watching her explore and interact with other kids. Sarah and I also try to have a date night once a week \u2014 sometimes it's just a quiet dinner at a local restaurant, other times it's a movie or a walk through the neighborhood. I also make time for myself, like going for runs with David or reading a book in the evenings.

I try to read at least one book a month, and it's become a way for me to unwind and reflect.

Another thing I do is volunteer at a local community center a few times a month. It's not something I do for recognition, but because I believe in giving back, especially to the immigrant and refugee communities that have helped me along the way. It's humbling to see how much people are willing to do for one another, and it reminds me of the support I received when I first arrived in the U.S. These routines, while small, are important to me \u2014 they help me maintain a sense of purpose beyond my job and family responsibilities.\n\n",

When I first moved to San Francisco, I was pretty sedentary \u2014 long hours at the office, not much time for exercise, and a diet that leaned heavily on takeout and convenience foods. That changed a few years ago when I started running with David. It was a small step, but it made a big difference. I began to feel more energetic, and it helped me manage the stress of work and family life. I also started paying more attention to what I eat, trying to incorporate more vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins into my meals. I still have days where I slip up \u2014 like when I'm too busy to cook and end up grabbing a sandwich or a coffee on the way home \u2014 but I've made a conscious effort to be more mindful. I also try to get enough sleep, though with a young child, that's not always easy.

I also find that cooking at home, even on busy days, helps me stay on track. Sarah and I have started meal prepping on weekends, and it's made a big difference in how I eat during the week.

I initially thought it was just from sitting too long at work or from the occasional awkward movement, but after a few months of persistent discomfort, I finally made an appointment with a physical therapist. They diagnosed me with mild lumbar strain and some early signs of disc degeneration. It wasn't a major issue, but it did require me to adjust my routine \u2014 I had to cut back on long-distance runs and focus more on low-impact exercises like swimming and yoga. I also started doing core strengthening exercises at home, which has helped a lot. It was a wake-up call for me to take my body more seriously, and I'm grateful that I caught it early. It's been a reminder that even as I'm trying to be healthier, I also need to be mindful of how I use my body in everyday life \u2014 especially with Lily being so active and requiring a lot of lifting and bending.\n\n",

How about you?\n\nEric Chen: Honestly, the back pain hasn't made it impossible for me to work or care for Lily, but it has definitely changed how I approach both. At work, I've had to be more mindful of my posture, especially during long meetings or when I'm hunched over my computer. I've started taking short walks between tasks to stretch and reset, which has helped a lot. As for caring for Lily, I've had to adjust how I lift her \u2014 I've learned to bend my knees more and keep my back straight, which has made a noticeable difference. There were a few weeks where I was really struggling, and I had to rely more on Sarah to help with some of the physical tasks at home. But I've come to see this as an opportunity to be more intentional about how I take care of my body, not just for myself, but for Lily too. I want to be there for her, not just as a father, but as someone who's strong and healthy enough to keep up with her energy. It's been a humbling experience, but I'm grateful for the lessons it's taught me.\n\n",

One of the most significant feelings I've experienced is a renewed appreciation for the small, everyday moments. Whether it's watching Lily laugh while she's trying to stack blocks higher than her head or sharing a quiet evening with Sarah after a long day, these moments have become my anchor. At the same time, there have been times when I've felt the weight of responsibility \u2014 balancing work, family, and my own health has been a constant juggling act. I've also felt a deep sense of connection to my community, especially through the volunteer work I do at the local community center. It's amazing how much I've learned from the people I meet there, and how much I've grown by giving back. I've also felt a bit of uncertainty at times, especially as I think about Lily's future and how I can best support her as she grows. But overall, I feel hopeful.

Discussing my health brought up some difficult but important realizations about how I need to take better care of my body, especially as I continue to balance work, family, and personal goals. It's easy to overlook the small things, like posture or the way I lift Lily, but these moments add up and shape my ability to be present for the people I love. The interview also made me think about how health isn't just about avoiding illness, but about creating habits that support a balanced and fulfilling life.

How about for you?\n\nEric Chen: Honestly, I've had moments where I've felt the weight of anxiety, especially during the early days of moving to San Francisco and starting my career. There were times when I questioned whether I was making the right choices \u2014 whether I was good enough, whether I belonged here. But over the years, those feelings have become less frequent, and I've learned to manage them through mindfulness, talking to Sarah, and staying connected with my support network. I still have days when I feel overwhelmed, especially with the demands of work and being a father, but I've come to see those moments as part of the human experience rather than something to be ashamed of. I've also started seeing a therapist occasionally, which has been helpful in processing some of the deeper emotions I didn't always know how to express. I think the key for me has been learning to be kind to myself, to recognize that it's okay to feel uncertain or stressed, and to take small steps toward healing and growth.

She's been balancing her work as a school counselor with the demands of being a mother, and I know how much she's giving of herself.

I was raised in a Buddhist household, and my parents always emphasized values like compassion, mindfulness, and respect for others. Even as a child, I found comfort in the rituals \u2014 the way we lit incense, the quiet moments of reflection before meals, and the emphasis on living in harmony with the world around us. But as I grew older, I began to feel a pull toward Protestant teachings, which resonated with me in a different way. It wasn't about changing my beliefs, but about finding a spiritual path that felt more aligned with my personal journey. Now, I don't attend church regularly, but I do find meaning in small, everyday acts of kindness and in the moments of gratitude I take for the people in my life. I think of spirituality as something that lives in the way I treat others, the way I raise Lily with empathy and curiosity, and the way I try to be present in each moment.

Facebook is how I stay in touch with my family back in Washington, especially my parents and my sister. I post occasional photos of Lily or share articles about education or parenting that I find interesting. It's a way to keep them involved in our lives, even though we're not all in the same place. Instagram, on the other hand, is more about following local artists, food spots, and community events in the Mission. I love seeing how creative people are here, and it's a great way to discover new places or ideas. I don't use it for personal updates much, but I do enjoy the visual storytelling aspect. I also follow some professional groups related to finance and data analysis, which helps me stay connected to my field.

I think I've always leaned more on the people I know in real life, like Sarah, my family, or my close friends.

Groceries are also a significant part of our monthly spending, especially since we try to eat healthy and cook at home as much as possible.

Then, when school started back in the fall, we had to pay for new school supplies, uniforms, and a few extra activities for Lily, like a music class she really enjoys.

Being a father has made me more aware of how important it is to be present, both at work and at home, and I try to leave work behind as much as possible once I'm home with Lily and Sarah.\n\n",

Most weeks, I'm in the office from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., but there are times when I need to stay late or come in early to meet with clients or prepare reports. I've learned to be more efficient with my time, especially since becoming a father \u2014 I try to leave work behind as much as possible so I can be fully present with Lily and Sarah. That said, there are moments when the demands of the job require more flexibility, and I've had to adjust my schedule accordingly. I also make sure to take weekends off as much as I can, unless there's something urgent at work. It's a balance, but one that I've come to accept as part of the life I've built here.\n\n",

My full-time role as a financial analyst has been my primary source of income for the past few years. However, I have taken on some side projects or freelance work occasionally, especially when I had more flexibility in my schedule. For example, I've done some data analysis for small startups or nonprofits on a contract basis, which allowed me to apply my skills in different ways and even gave me a chance to work with causes I care about, like education and community development. I also used to teach a few weekend workshops on financial literacy for immigrant families through a local community center, which was both rewarding and a way to give back. While these weren't long-term commitments, they added value to my professional experience and helped me stay engaged with the community. Overall, I've found that having a single, stable job has been the best fit for my family life, especially with Lily needing so much attention and support. I think it's important to have a balance \u2014 enough to provide for our needs, but also enough time to be present for the people who matter most.\n\n",

Talking about my stress levels and coping strategies reminded me of how important it is to have a support system \u2014 whether it's Sarah, my friends, or even the small moments of mindfulness I practice. It also made me think about how I manage my emotions, especially as a father and a professional, and how I've learned to find balance in the chaos. Discussing our monthly budget and expenses brought up the reality of living in San Francisco \u2014 the high cost of living, the sacrifices we make to provide for Lily, and the need to be intentional with every dollar. It's not always easy, but I've come to see it as part of the journey we're on together. I also felt a deep sense of gratitude for the people in my life who help me stay grounded, whether through emotional support, financial advice, or just being there when I need someone to talk to. These reflections have reminded me that while life can be unpredictable, it's also filled with moments of connection, growth, and purpose \u2014 and I'm grateful for every one of them.",

That comes from my full-time salary as a financial analyst, which is around $7,000 after taxes, and Sarah's part-time work as a school counselor, which brings in about $1,500. We also occasionally have some freelance income from my data analysis projects, which can add a few hundred dollars here and there. It's not always consistent, but it helps us cover some of the smaller expenses or unexpected costs. I think the most important thing for us is that we're able to meet our basic needs \u2014 rent, food, Lily's care \u2014 and still have some room to save or enjoy the little things. It's not extravagant, but it's enough to feel secure and to build a life we're proud of.\n\n",

The benefits package is solid \u2014 we have health insurance that covers me, Sarah, and Lily, which is a huge relief, especially with my back issues. We also get paid time off, including vacation days, sick leave, and personal days, which has been really helpful in managing work-life balance. One of the things I appreciate most is the flexibility \u2014 while the core hours are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., there's a lot of autonomy in how I structure my day, which is important when I need to leave early for a doctor's appointment or stay late to finish a project. The company also offers some professional development opportunities, like workshops on data visualization and leadership training, which I've taken advantage of. I think the most valuable part of the job, though, is the sense of purpose it gives me \u2014 knowing that my work helps businesses make better decisions, which in turn supports families and communities.

My manager, Karen, is someone I really respect. She's been with the company for over a decade, and she has a way of balancing professionalism with genuine care for her team. She's given me a lot of autonomy in my role, which I appreciate, but she's also not afraid to step in when I need guidance. I think that trust has helped me grow a lot in the past few years.

There's Marcus, who's been my partner on several projects \u2014 we have a good rapport, and we often joke around, which helps keep the work environment light. Then there's Priya, who's in the finance department and has been a great mentor to me.

That said, there are times when the workload increases, especially around quarter-end or when we're working on big client projects. During those periods, I might have to adjust my hours or work from home a few days a week. I also take advantage of the flexibility to leave early if I need to pick up Lily from daycare or attend a school event. It's a balance, but I think the flexibility helps me manage both my professional and personal responsibilities without feeling completely stretched thin.
