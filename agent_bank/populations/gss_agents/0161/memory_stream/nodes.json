Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMadelyn Whitworth: I was born and raised in a small town in the Middle Atlantic region, though I didn't stay there long. My family moved to Pennsylvania when I was around ten, and I've been in Philadelphia ever since. Growing up, we weren't wealthy by any means\u2014my parents worked hard, but we always struggled to make ends meet. My father only had a high school diploma, and my mother went to an associate's program at a community college, but she worked full-time as well. I remember feeling the pressure of wanting to do better, to break the cycle of limited opportunities. I was a pretty quiet kid, always reading books or writing stories in my notebook. I was raised Catholic, but I haven't practiced that faith in years. I went to college on a scholarship, and I ended up earning a graduate degree in social work, which I'm still working in today. It's a job that keeps me busy, but I find it meaningful. I've never married, and I don't see myself wanting to in the near future. I've had my share of challenges, but I've always tried to stay focused on my goals and make the most of what I have.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMadelyn Whitworth: There was definitely a crossroads moment for me, and it came during my sophomore year of college. I had just started my degree program, and I was working part-time at a local community center while taking a full course load. I was really struggling to balance everything, and I remember feeling like I was barely keeping my head above water. One day, I met a social worker there who had been through a similar background to mine\u2014grew up in a working-class family, didn't have much in the way of financial support, and had to work their way through school. She took me under her wing and started mentoring me. She saw something in me that I didn't see in myself at the time. She encouraged me to apply for a graduate program in social work, even though I was terrified of the idea. I had never considered going beyond a bachelor's degree, and the thought of more school felt overwhelming. But she helped me see that if I wanted to make a real difference in people's lives, I needed to be equipped with the tools to do so. That conversation changed everything for me. I applied, got in, and it was the best decision I ever made. It wasn't just about the degree\u2014it was about finding my purpose. I realized that I wanted to help others navigate the same struggles I had, and that gave me a sense of direction I had never felt before.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nMadelyn Whitworth: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made easily. It felt like I was standing at the edge of something I didn't fully understand, and I was scared of what might happen if I took the leap. But I also knew that staying where I was\u2014just scraping by, working minimum wage jobs, and feeling like I was never going to get ahead\u2014wasn't the life I wanted. That mentor, Ms. O'Connor, she didn't just hand me a path; she showed me that I had the strength to walk it. I remember sitting in her office that day, looking at the stack of applications I had to fill out for the graduate program, and thinking, 'What if I fail?' But then I thought about the kids I had worked with at the community center\u2014kids who looked up to me, who believed I could be something more. I didn't want to let them down. So I made the choice to apply, and I told myself that if I didn't get in, I would keep pushing forward. But I did get in, and it felt like the universe was finally giving me a chance to rewrite my story.\n\n",

I've seen how a single person or organization can be the difference between someone staying stuck in a cycle or breaking free. When I was in high school, I remember there was a local nonprofit that offered tutoring and mentorship programs for kids from low-income families. I didn't have access to much outside of school, but that program gave me the resources I needed to keep going. I don't know where I'd be without people like Ms. O'Connor or that nonprofit. It's why I try to give back now\u2014whether it's through my job or volunteering in my community. I believe in the power of support systems, and I want to be part of that for others.\n\n",

My focus has been on building a stable career and giving back to the community that helped me when I was growing up. My parents are still in Philadelphia, and though we don't see each other as often as I'd like, we stay in touch. My mother, in particular, has always been a source of strength for me. She worked multiple jobs to put me through school, and I know how much she sacrificed. I try to make her proud, even if I can't always be there in person. My father passed away a few years ago, which was a huge loss. He wasn't the most expressive man, but I know he loved me in his own way. I carry his memory with me, and it reminds me of why I fight so hard to make a difference in the lives of others.\n\n",

One of them is Jordan, who I met in college. We bonded over our shared experiences growing up in similar circumstances\u2014neither of us had much in the way of financial support, and we both felt the pressure to prove ourselves. Jordan ended up going into nonprofit work as well, and we've stayed in touch even after graduation.

There's also my best friend from high school, Sam, who's now a teacher in the suburbs. We don't see each other as often as we used to, but whenever we do, it's like no time has passed.

It's a place where people from different backgrounds come together, and I love that about it. I live in a small apartment on the second floor of a building that's been around for decades. It's not fancy, but it's comfortable and has a lot of character. My building has a small courtyard where neighbors gather for barbecues or just to chat, and I think that sense of community is one of the things I value most about living here. I work a few blocks away at a nonprofit that helps families in need, and I often walk to work, passing by the same bodegas, bookstores, and community gardens that I used to walk by as a kid.

Most people know each other, and there's a sense of mutual respect. I've never had any real issues with crime in my building or in the immediate area. I think part of that is because of the community centers and the local organizations that work to keep things positive. I've seen how these places bring people together and create a kind of natural protection\u2014when you care about your neighbors, you look out for them. That said, I'm not naive. I know there are challenges, and I've had to be careful at times, especially when I was younger.

My job at the nonprofit keeps me busy\u2014most days involve meetings with clients, case management, and sometimes attending community events or workshops.

I remember one particular week when I was struggling to get out of bed in the morning, and I had a client meeting scheduled. I had to cancel it last minute, and I felt awful about it. It was a wake-up call that my health isn't just a personal issue\u2014it impacts the people I serve, too. I've had to learn to ask for help when I need it, whether it's from my colleagues at work or from my friends. It's not always easy to admit that I can't do everything on my own, but I'm trying to be more honest about my limits. I think the hardest part is knowing that I want to be there for others, but I also need to be there for myself. It's a balance I'm still learning to strike, but I'm getting better at it.\n\n",

Tell me all about how you have been feeling.\n\nMadelyn Whitworth: Over the past year, I've had a lot of mixed emotions. There have been moments of deep fulfillment, especially when I've been able to make a real difference in someone's life\u2014whether it's helping a family secure stable housing or connecting a client with the resources they need. Those moments remind me why I chose this path, and they give me a sense of purpose that I don't take for granted. But there have also been times when I've felt overwhelmed, especially with the ongoing challenges in our community and the emotional toll of my work. I think the pandemic really took a toll on a lot of people, and I've seen that in my clients, too. Some of them have struggled with mental health issues, financial instability, or just feeling disconnected from the world around them. It's been hard to watch, and sometimes it's hard to separate my own feelings from what I see in others. I've had to lean on my support system more than ever\u2014whether it's my friends, my therapist, or even just the quiet moments I take for myself. I've also been trying to be more intentional about self-care, which has helped me stay grounded. It's not always easy, but I'm learning that taking care of myself isn't a luxury\u2014it's a necessity. I hope that in the coming year, I can continue to grow, both personally and professionally, and find ways to give back even more to the people who need it most.\n\n",

How about for you?\n\nMadelyn Whitworth: I think I've struggled with anxiety more than anything else, though I didn't always recognize it for what it was. There were times when I felt like I was constantly on edge, like I was waiting for something bad to happen\u2014whether it was at work, in my personal life, or just the weight of the world pressing down on me. I used to think it was just stress, but over time, I realized it was more than that. I started seeing a therapist a few years ago, and that was a turning point for me. Through therapy, I learned how to identify the signs of anxiety and how to manage it before it got out of control. I still have days when it creeps in, especially when I'm overwhelmed with work or when I see clients going through really tough situations. But I've learned to take it one day at a time, to breathe when I feel myself spiraling, and to remind myself that I'm not alone in this. It's not something I'm ever going to completely eliminate, but I've come to terms with the fact that it's part of who I am\u2014and that's okay. I've also started practicing mindfulness and journaling, which have been huge tools in helping me stay grounded. I know there are still days when I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle, but I'm learning to be kinder to myself and to seek help when I need it.

She still calls me every week, and even though we don't talk for long, I can always tell she's proud of me. She's been through so much, and seeing me build a life that's stable and meaningful for her\u2014it means the world to her. My father, though he's no longer with us, left a legacy of quiet strength that I carry with me every day. He wasn't the most expressive man, but I know he loved me in his own way, and I think about him a lot when I'm working with clients who are struggling to find their way. My sister, Claire, has been more distant lately, but I know she cares. She's always been the more outgoing one, and I think she sometimes feels like she doesn't understand the path I've chosen. But when we do talk, she reminds me that I'm not alone in this. She's had her own struggles, and I think she sees my work as a way of giving back, even if she doesn't always get it.

How about you?\n\nMadelyn Whitworth: I was raised Catholic, and for a long time, I thought of religion as something I had to follow, even if I didn't always feel connected to it. My family went to church every Sunday, and I remember sitting in the pews, listening to the priest speak about faith and forgiveness. But as I grew older, I started to question a lot of those teachings. I didn't feel like I could reconcile the strictness of the faith with the way I saw the world\u2014especially the struggles my family faced. Over time, I drifted away from organized religion, and now I don't really identify with any particular faith. That said, I think spirituality, in a broader sense, has always been a part of me. I find meaning in the connections I make with others, in the small moments of kindness, and in the work I do. I don't need a church to feel grounded\u2014I find that in the people I serve, in the quiet moments of reflection, and in the belief that we all have the power to change each other's lives.

I know it's a big part of how people stay connected these days, but I've always found it more overwhelming than comforting. I used to have a Facebook account back in college, mostly to keep in touch with friends and family, but over time, I found myself getting caught up in the noise\u2014comparing my life to others, seeing posts about people traveling the world or living these seemingly perfect lives, and it started to affect how I felt about my own journey. I remember one day scrolling through my feed and feeling like I wasn't doing enough, like I was falling behind. It wasn't helping me feel grounded, so I decided to take a break. Now, I only use it occasionally, usually to check in with my mother or to see what my sister is up to. I prefer face-to-face connections or even a phone call over the impersonal nature of social media. I think it's important to be present in the moment, and I find that when I'm not constantly looking at a screen, I'm more aware of the world around me\u2014the people I walk past, the conversations I have, the small acts of kindness that make life meaningful.

That said, I know it's different for everyone. Some people find comfort in those platforms, and I respect that.

There were times when I felt like I was carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders, and it was hard to separate my own emotions from the struggles of the people I serve.

I've taken up journaling more consistently, and I find that writing down my thoughts helps me untangle them and see things more clearly.

Rent is the largest chunk of my budget\u2014my apartment is modest, but it's in a part of the city that's still affordable compared to other areas. I pay around $1,200 a month for it, which is a lot when you consider my salary, but it's something I've had to prioritize.

In the winter, for example, my heating bill went up a bit, which was a challenge since I'm always trying to balance my budget. I remember one month when the temperature dropped suddenly, and I had to use my space heater more than usual, which added a few extra dollars to my electricity bill. Then there were the holidays\u2014December was always the most expensive month because I had to buy gifts for my family, even if it was just small things like a card or a homemade meal. I also had to set aside money for my mother's birthday, which was important to me. In the spring, things were a bit easier, especially when the weather warmed up and I used less heating. But then there were unexpected costs, like when my bus pass needed to be renewed, or when I had to buy a new pair of shoes for work. I also noticed that my physical therapy sessions became a more regular expense, which I hadn't anticipated when I first started. It's been a learning process, trying to track these fluctuations and adjust my budget accordingly.

It's not always easy work\u2014it can be emotionally draining and sometimes frustrating when the system doesn't move as quickly as we'd like. But what keeps me going is the moments when I see a client's face light up because they finally got the help they needed. That's what makes it all worth it.

Mondays are typically the busiest days with a lot of administrative work, meetings, and planning for the week ahead. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are more about direct service\u2014visiting clients, attending community events, and just being there to listen and support them. Thursdays are a mix of both, and I try to use Fridays to catch up on paperwork or attend a training session. I also volunteer at a local food pantry on weekends, which adds a few more hours to my week. It's not always easy balancing everything, but I've learned to prioritize what matters most. Some days I feel like I'm running on empty, but others, when I see a client's face light up because they finally got the help they needed, it all feels worth it.\n\n",

I've always focused on my work at 'Community Roots' because it's the kind of job that requires a lot of emotional and mental energy, and I want to be fully present for my clients. I used to work part-time at a bookstore during college, which was a nice balance\u2014it gave me a creative outlet and a way to connect with people in a different way. But once I started my social work career, I realized how much it demanded of me, both in time and in emotional labor. I've tried to keep my schedule as structured as possible, and I don't think I could handle having multiple jobs without compromising the quality of my work or my well-being. I've learned that for me, it's better to be fully committed to one path, even if it means working long hours, than to spread myself too thin and not be able to give my best to anyone.\n\n",

It wasn't until I started paying closer attention to my emotional well-being that I realized how much I had been carrying on my own. I used to think that pushing through stress and anxiety was just part of the job, but now I see it as a sign that I need to take better care of myself. Learning to acknowledge my emotions, journaling, and practicing yoga have been small but meaningful steps in that direction. At the same time, reflecting on my family reminded me of the quiet strength and support they've always provided, even when they didn't have the words to express it. My mother's unwavering belief in me, my father's silent love, and my sister's occasional but meaningful presence all remind me that I'm not alone in this journey. And while I've chosen to step back from social media, I've come to appreciate that real connection and support come from the people I know and love, not from the likes and comments of strangers. These reflections have helped me see that my well-being is not just about surviving\u2014it's about thriving, even in the midst of challenges.",

It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover my basic needs and some of the smaller things that make life a little more comfortable. I know it's not much compared to what some people earn, but I'm grateful for the stability it provides.

The benefits of the job are pretty standard for a nonprofit\u2014health insurance is the biggest one, which has been a lifesaver, especially with the chronic back pain I've been dealing with. I also get a certain number of paid days off each year, though I don't always take them because I feel like I'm always needed. There's sick time, which is important, and I've used it a few times when I've been struggling with my health. The organization also offers some professional development opportunities, like workshops on trauma-informed care or mental health first aid, which I've found really helpful in my work. One of the things I appreciate most is the sense of purpose that comes with the job.

I have a good rapport with my manager, Sarah, who's been with the organization for over a decade. She's seen a lot, and she has this way of knowing when to push me and when to give me space.
