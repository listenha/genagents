  "agent_profile_summary": "Madelyn Whitworth, a 23-year-old social worker in Philadelphia, grew up in a working-class family in the Middle Atlantic region before moving to Pennsylvania, where she has lived since childhood. Raised Catholic but now non-religious, she pursued a graduate degree in social work after a pivotal mentor, Ms. O'Connor, encouraged her to apply during her sophomore year of college—a decision that reshaped her path from part-time community center work to a career helping low-income families with housing and healthcare. Living in West Philly, she balances a demanding 45-hour workweek at a nonprofit with volunteering at a food pantry and maintaining a small but meaningful routine of reading, cooking, and mindfulness. Her life is driven by a deep commitment to community support and a desire to break cycles of poverty, shaped by her parents’ sacrifices and her own struggles with anxiety and chronic back pain. She values connection above all, striving to be both a steady presence for others and a mindful steward of her own well-being."
