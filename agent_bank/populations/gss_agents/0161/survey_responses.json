She also mentions that she didn't feel like she was doing enough during her early career and often felt overwhelmed by the emotional weight of her work. While she has grown more confident in her role as a social worker, she still seems to value introspection and self-reflection, as seen in her journaling and mindfulness practices. She also mentions that she doesn't use social media much and prefers face-to-face connections, which suggests a more reserved nature.",

She values real, meaningful connections and has spoken about the importance of trust in her work as a social worker. Her ability to listen, support, and care for others suggests a trusting nature.

She has described feeling overwhelmed at times and has had to actively work on coping strategies like mindfulness and journaling. While she has made progress in managing her stress, she still acknowledges the challenges and doesn't always feel in control of her emotions. This suggests she would not rate herself as a 5, but she also isn't someone who is completely overwhelmed, indicating a middle range.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant mentions being a reader and having a routine of reading fiction and nonfiction, which suggests some engagement with creative or expressive activities. However, she does not mention any direct involvement with visual arts, music, or other traditional forms of art. Her focus on her work as a social worker and her emphasis on community service and practical problem-solving suggest a more utilitarian or service-oriented personality, which aligns more with the lower end of the range.",

She consistently shows up for her clients, takes their needs seriously, and reflects on her work with a sense of purpose and responsibility.

She has described feeling overwhelmed at times and has had to work on coping strategies like mindfulness, journaling, and therapy. While she has made progress in managing her anxiety, she has not described herself as someone who is consistently calm or unbothered. This suggests she would likely rate herself higher on the scale, reflecting her ongoing struggles with nervousness.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Madelyn frequently mentions her love for reading, writing stories in her notebook as a child, and her work in social work, which involves understanding and empathizing with others' stories.

            "REI_9": "Madelyn's narrative reflects a strong emphasis on empathy, personal connections, and emotional intelligence in her work as a social worker. While she does show problem-solving skills, her approach is deeply rooted in understanding people's lived experiences and emotional contexts, rather than purely logical analysis. She also describes her decision-making as being influenced by mentors and personal values, which suggests a more intuitive or emotionally guided approach to problem-solving.",
            "REI_10": "Madelyn frequently reflects on her decisions, such as choosing her career path, prioritizing self-care, and making conscious choices about her work and personal life. She often explains her reasoning, such as why she chose social work, how she balances her responsibilities, and why she values certain aspects of her life.

            "BFI-10_1": "Madelyn describes herself as a quiet child who preferred reading and writing stories in her notebook. She also mentions not being very expressive in her early life and not being the most outgoing person. While she has grown into a confident social worker, she still seems to value introspection and meaningful connections over loud or attention-seeking behavior. This suggests she would lean more toward the lower end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Madelyn has demonstrated a strong sense of empathy, connection, and willingness to support others in her work as a social worker. She values real, meaningful connections and has spoken about the importance of trust in her relationships with clients, family, and friends. Her work requires her to trust others and be trusted in return, which suggests she is generally trusting in nature.",
            "BFI-10_3": "The participant describes herself as someone who is driven by purpose, works full-time in a demanding field, and has consistently worked to improve her life and the lives of others. She mentions her strong work ethic, the sacrifices her parents made, and her commitment to her job and community. These traits are inconsistent with viewing herself as lazy. Instead, she portrays herself as someone who is dedicated, hardworking, and intentional about her goals.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Madelyn has discussed her struggles with anxiety and the emotional toll of her work as a social worker. She has acknowledged that she sometimes feels overwhelmed and has had to learn coping strategies like mindfulness and journaling. While she has made progress in managing her stress, she has not described herself as consistently relaxed or someone who handles stress effortlessly. This suggests she would likely rate herself somewhere in the middle of the range, but not at the higher end.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant mentions being a reader and having a routine that includes reading fiction and nonfiction, which shows some engagement with creative or artistic activities. However, there is no explicit mention of other artistic interests such as music, visual arts, or creative writing. The participant’s focus on social work, community service, and practical life management suggests a more utilitarian approach to life, which aligns with having few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Madelyn describes herself as someone who values meaningful connections but is not particularly focused on being outgoing or sociable in a traditional sense. She mentions having a few close friends and a strong sense of community, but she also emphasizes her quiet determination and introspective nature. She does not describe herself as someone who actively seeks out social situations or enjoys being the center of attention. Instead, she seems more content with deep, meaningful relationships rather than a wide social network.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Madelyn describes herself as someone who is empathetic, compassionate, and focused on helping others. She emphasizes listening, supporting, and lifting others up, especially in her work as a social worker. She also reflects on her own struggles and the importance of self-care and understanding, which suggests she is more likely to be forgiving and less prone to finding fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Madelyn describes her work as a social worker with a strong sense of purpose and dedication. She emphasizes the importance of listening, connecting clients with resources, and being present for her clients.

            "BFI-10_9": "Madelyn has discussed her struggles with anxiety, particularly in the context of her work as a social worker, where she faces emotionally heavy situations daily. She has also reflected on how she has learned to manage her anxiety through therapy, mindfulness, and journaling. While she acknowledges her anxiety, she has also made progress in coping with it. However, she has not described herself as someone who is consistently calm or unbothered, which suggests she would not rate herself as a 1. Given her openness about her anxiety, she is more likely to identify with a higher number on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Madelyn mentions in the interview that she was a 'quiet kid, always reading books or writing stories in my notebook.' She also references her love of reading fiction and her connection to storytelling, which suggests a strong imagination. Her work in social work also involves empathy and understanding others' perspectives, which can be seen as imaginative in nature. These details align with a higher score on the imagination scale."
