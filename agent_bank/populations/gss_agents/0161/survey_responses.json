She also mentions that she didn't feel like she was doing enough during her early career and often felt overwhelmed by the emotional weight of her work. While she has grown more confident in her role as a social worker, she still seems to value introspection and self-reflection, as seen in her journaling and mindfulness practices. She also mentions that she doesn't use social media much and prefers face-to-face connections, which suggests a more reserved nature.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Madelyn has shown a deep sense of empathy, connection, and commitment to her clients, colleagues, and community. She values real, meaningful connections and has spoken about the importance of trust in her work as a social worker. Her ability to listen, support, and care for others suggests a trusting nature.

She has a strong sense of purpose and dedication, particularly in her role as a social worker.

            "BFI-10_4": "Madelyn has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety and the emotional toll of her work as a social worker. She has described feeling overwhelmed at times and has had to actively work on coping strategies like mindfulness and journaling. While she has made progress in managing her stress, she still acknowledges the challenges and doesn't always feel in control of her emotions. This suggests she would not rate herself as a 5, but she also isn't someone who is completely overwhelmed, indicating a middle range.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant mentions being a reader and having a routine of reading fiction and nonfiction, which suggests some engagement with creative or expressive activities. However, she does not mention any direct involvement with visual arts, music, or other traditional forms of art. Her focus on her work as a social worker and her emphasis on community service and practical problem-solving suggest a more utilitarian or service-oriented personality, which aligns more with the lower end of the range.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Madelyn describes herself as quiet in her childhood, preferring to read or write stories in her notebook. While she has close relationships with friends and family, she does not actively seek out large social interactions or describe herself as someone who enjoys being the center of attention.

She consistently shows up for her clients, takes their needs seriously, and reflects on her work with a sense of purpose and responsibility. Her job requires her to be thorough in order to effectively support people in need, and she mentions moments where she sees the impact of her work, which suggests she takes her responsibilities seriously and strives to do a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Madelyn has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, particularly in relation to her work as a social worker and the emotional weight she carries. She has described feeling overwhelmed at times and has had to work on coping strategies like mindfulness, journaling, and therapy. While she has made progress in managing her anxiety, she has not described herself as someone who is consistently calm or unbothered. This suggests she would likely rate herself higher on the scale, reflecting her ongoing struggles with nervousness.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Madelyn frequently mentions her love for reading, writing stories in her notebook as a child, and her work in social work, which involves understanding and empathizing with others' stories. These traits suggest a rich inner life and imagination. She also reflects on her life in a narrative and introspective way, indicating a strong imaginative capacity."

Instead, she portrays herself as someone who is dedicated, hardworking, and intentional about her goals.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Madelyn has discussed her struggles with anxiety and the emotional toll of her work as a social worker. She has acknowledged that she sometimes feels overwhelmed and has had to learn coping strategies like mindfulness and journaling. While she has made progress in managing her stress, she has not described herself as consistently relaxed or someone who handles stress effortlessly. This suggests she would likely rate herself somewhere in the middle of the range, but not at the higher end.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant mentions being a reader and having a routine that includes reading fiction and nonfiction, which shows some engagement with creative or artistic activities. However, there is no explicit mention of other artistic interests such as music, visual arts, or creative writing.

She mentions having a few close friends and a strong sense of community, but she also emphasizes her quiet determination and introspective nature.

She has also reflected on how she has learned to manage her anxiety through therapy, mindfulness, and journaling. While she acknowledges her anxiety, she has also made progress in coping with it. However, she has not described herself as someone who is consistently calm or unbothered, which suggests she would not rate herself as a 1. Given her openness about her anxiety, she is more likely to identify with a higher number on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Madelyn mentions in the interview that she was a 'quiet kid, always reading books or writing stories in my notebook.' She also references her love of reading fiction and her connection to storytelling, which suggests a strong imagination.
