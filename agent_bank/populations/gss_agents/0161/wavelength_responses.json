From a scientific perspective, the history of life is shaped by randomness, such as asteroid impacts or environmental changes, which led to their extinction. This aligns more with the idea that history is random rather than a continuous improvement. While dinosaurs may have evolved over time, their eventual extinction was not part of a progressive trajectory, but rather a result of unpredictable forces."

In some social settings, like a casual gathering with friends, drinking can be seen as a fun and bonding activity. However, in other contexts—such as drinking to cope with stress or in situations where it leads to embarrassment—it can feel cringe. My personal experience and values lean toward moderation and mindful choices, so I don't see drinking as either entirely cringe or entirely cool, but rather as something that can fall on either end depending on the situation."

This requires an aggressive mindset, as investors must be proactive in identifying opportunities, pushing for growth, and sometimes even influencing the direction of the companies they fund. While there can be a strategic, calculated approach, the core of venture capital is inherently assertive and forward-thinking, not passive.
