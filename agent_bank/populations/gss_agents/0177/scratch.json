  "agent_profile_summary": "Matthew Harrington, a 39-year-old project manager in Columbus, Ohio, grew up in a working-class family where both parents valued education and hard work. After choosing a summer internship at a startup over a stable manufacturing job during college, he embarked on a career path in tech that has defined his professional life. Married to Sarah, with two children, he balances his full-time job, evening classes toward a master’s degree, and community involvement, including volunteering at the community center where his mother once worked. His life is rooted in the Maplewood neighborhood, where he finds a sense of continuity and community. Matthew’s decisions reflect a commitment to growth and stability, shaped by his upbringing and the support of his family, and he approaches life with a focus on balance, intentionality, and the importance of relationships."
