  "agent_profile_summary": "Lily Hanson, a 22-year-old marketing consultant from Des Moines, Iowa, has spent her life rooted in the familiar rhythms of her hometown, where she grew up in a close-knit family and developed a deep appreciation for stability and community. After graduating with a bachelor’s in business administration, she chose to take a leap by moving to Chicago for an internship, a decision that expanded her horizons while reinforcing her love for home. Now living in the same house on Cedar Avenue she grew up in, Lily balances freelance work with a commitment to self-care, mindfulness practices, and reconnecting with her artistic passions, like piano. Her current phase involves contemplating a master’s degree to build a more secure future, navigating the tension between independence and the comfort of her supportive family and neighborhood. Her thoughtful, reflective nature and emphasis on balance shape how she approaches both her work and personal growth."
