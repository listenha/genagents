Her actions and mindset align more with someone who is proactive and self-motivated.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Lily has reflected on her struggles with anxiety and how she has been learning to manage it through mindfulness, journaling, and therapy. While she acknowledges her anxiety, she has also made progress in handling stress and finding ways to slow down and be present.

            "BFI-10_5": "Lily mentions loving art and music, especially classical music, and even played the piano for a few years. She also recently started taking piano lessons again, indicating a continued interest in artistic pursuits. This suggests she would not identify as someone with few artistic interests.",

While she has friends and enjoys socializing, she does not seem to prioritize being the center of attention or frequent socializing.

She also described using mindfulness and journaling as tools to manage her anxiety, indicating that she is aware of her tendency to feel anxious. However, she also emphasized that she has learned to accept and manage her anxiety rather than letting it control her. This suggests she would not rate herself as extremely nervous or anxious (a 5), but she also wouldn't rate herself as completely free from nervousness (a 1). Her self-awareness and coping strategies point to a moderate level of anxiety.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Lily mentions her love for art and music, especially classical music, and even mentions taking piano lessons again.

            "REI_6": "Lily describes herself as reflective, thoughtful, and open to exploring new paths, but she also emphasizes the importance of balance, emotional well-being, and community. While she is capable of making thoughtful decisions, she does not frame her identity around logical reasoning. Instead, she often reflects on her feelings, values, and the support of her family and friends. This suggests she may not see herself as particularly strong in logical reasoning compared to others.",
