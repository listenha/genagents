From my own experience, smoke detectors can be quite bothersome when they go off unnecessarily or when they are old and prone to false alarms.

Based on my experiences, I have a balanced relationship with new places—while I appreciate the comfort of home and the stability of Des Moines, I also understand the value of new experiences. However, this clue feels more like a moment of calm and introspection in a new setting rather than a strong feeling of wanderlust or homesickness.

However, it lacks the boldness or intensity of something truly zesty.

I remember receiving notes from my parents, friends, or even from my mom when I was younger—notes that felt thoughtful and caring. These were never cold or impersonal. While a hand-written note could theoretically be cold, in my life, they've always been a source of warmth and comfort. I value the personal touch and intention behind handwritten notes, which makes them feel warm and fuzzy to me."
