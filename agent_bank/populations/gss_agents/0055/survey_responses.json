            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Theresa describes herself as someone who values community and support, indicating a level of social engagement. She has a close family network, participates in community activities, and enjoys being involved in the arts. These traits suggest she is not someone who sees herself as extremely reserved. However, she also mentions feeling the need for self-care and sometimes needing breaks, which might indicate a preference for more personal space. Given this balance, Theresa is likely closer to the middle of the spectrum but leans slightly towards the 'reserved' side.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Theresa appears to be a warm and supportive person with a strong emphasis on community and family. She has described herself as moderate politically and independent, which suggests a balanced worldview. Additionally, she values the support of her family and community, indicating a generally positive and trusting outlook towards people. This aligns more closely with the higher end of the trust spectrum.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on the interview, Theresa appears to be a hardworking individual who values balance and productivity in both her professional and personal life. She mentions that she tries to maintain a strict grocery list to avoid unnecessary spending, and she actively seeks ways to manage stress and find emotional coping strategies. These traits suggest that she is not likely to see herself as lazy. Furthermore, she describes a busy and fulfilling life, indicating a strong sense of engagement and purpose.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Theresa appears to handle stress reasonably well. She mentions incorporating mindfulness practices like journaling and deep breathing exercises, and she acknowledges the importance of self-care. However, she also recognizes that stress is a part of her life and that she has been dealing with it through various coping mechanisms. Given her ability to maintain a balanced life and her awareness of stress management techniques, it seems she is not entirely relaxed all the time but is certainly capable of handling stress well compared to someone who would choose a lower score.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Theresa describes herself as someone who pursued a career in the arts and considers herself an artist. She mentions her passion for art and its importance in her life. Therefore, it is unlikely that she would choose the lowest end of the scale (1), indicating few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Theresa describes herself as being deeply involved in community activities, supporting her children's extracurricular activities, and being actively engaged in her professional and personal life.

            "BFI-10_8": "Based on Theresa's interview, she appears to be someone who values her work and takes pride in her contributions. She mentions curating exhibitions and managing a gallery, which suggests she pays close attention to detail and ensures everything runs smoothly. Additionally, she talks about her children's development and her involvement in their activities, indicating she is detail-oriented and thorough in her parenting. This aligns more with someone who would choose 5.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Theresa describes herself as someone who has faced various challenges and has developed resilience. She mentions coping strategies like mindfulness practices and support from her community. These factors suggest that she is capable of managing her nervousness and anxiety. However, she does mention dealing with stress and anxiety, especially in the context of balancing work and family life. This indicates that while she can handle it, she may still experience nervousness from time to time. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems most fitting.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Theresa is described as someone who pursues a career in the arts and is passionate about creativity. This indicates that she likely has a vivid and active imagination. Additionally, she values nurturing her children's unique talents and aspirations, suggesting she is someone who can envision and inspire creativity in others.

While she values her work in the arts and her contributions to her community, she also acknowledged that she is trying to manage stress and find coping mechanisms, suggesting a willingness to recognize areas where she might need improvement. Given her reflective and balanced nature, it is reasonable to assume she would not strongly agree with the statement that she is not good at figuring out complicated problems. However, she might not completely disagree either, as she has faced and overcome challenges in her life. Therefore, a moderate response is more fitting.",

While she mentions that she has had to balance practical considerations with her dreams, there is no indication that she struggles with logical analysis or problem-solving.

She mentioned that she has been trying to incorporate mindfulness practices but also acknowledged the importance of her support network.

She mentions facing various challenges and stressors, such as managing a busy schedule, dealing with unexpected expenses, and supporting her children's development. While she acknowledges that she has experienced stress and anxiety, she also mentions strategies like mindfulness practices and seeking support from her network, which suggests she is not completely overwhelmed by pressure. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that while she might find some situations challenging, she doesn't consistently struggle to reason well under pressure.",

She values her community and support network, suggesting she might not always rely solely on logic. However, her profession as a curator involves a significant amount of planning and decision-making, which often requires logical thinking. Given her described career and the fact that she finds value in both community and logic, it's reasonable to assume she would lean towards valuing logic in problem-solving.",

She reflects on significant choices and the importance of balancing her dreams with practical considerations. This suggests she is thoughtful about her decisions and can explain them. However, she also mentions that certain moments felt like they 'just happened,' indicating she isn't always overly analytical. Given her thoughtful nature and the emphasis on clear explanations in her life, a score of 4 or 5 seems fitting, but considering her reflections on spontaneous moments, a 4 might be more accurate."
