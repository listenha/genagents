Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nTheresa Mikell: Sure, let's take it from the beginning. I was born in Yugoslavia, though I moved to the United States when I was six years old. My family and I immigrated here during a time of political turmoil in our home country. We settled in Princeton, New Jersey, which became my home. Growing up, I lived with my parents, who both worked to support us. My father had less than a high school education, while my mother also didn't complete high school. However, she worked hard to help provide for our family, even though it wasn't easy. I remember the challenges we faced, but also the close-knit community and the support we received from friends and neighbors.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nTheresa Mikell: One such moment came when I was in high school. I had always been good at academics, but I was also passionate about art and music. I faced a decision whether to pursue a career in the arts or focus on academics, which could potentially lead to a more stable future. I remember sitting with my parents one evening, discussing our options. They encouraged me to follow my heart and pursue what truly made me happy. That night, I decided to apply to art schools and community colleges, even though it meant taking on more debt. It turned out to be one of the best decisions of my life. I ended up attending an art school and later got a graduate degree. Looking back, that moment really shaped who I am today - someone who values creativity and happiness alongside stability.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nTheresa Mikell: It definitely felt like a conscious choice, but it also felt like something that was pushing from within me. I knew deep down that I couldn't just sit back and let life pass me by without pursuing my passions. My parents were incredibly supportive, but they also understood the importance of having a plan for the future. I think that moment taught me a lot about balancing my dreams with practical considerations, and it has stayed with me throughout my life.\n\n",

They often offer scholarships, resources, and guidance that can make a huge difference. Looking back, I'm grateful for all the support I received, but I also recognize that sometimes you need to take the initiative yourself.\n\n",

Over the past two years, I've faced minor health issues like a back strain and my daughter's cold, which have been reminders to stay vigilant about health precautions. Managing these challenges while balancing work and family has required careful planning and support from my network. The importance of self-care, whether through physical activity, healthy eating, or simply having a stocked medicine cabinet, cannot be overstated. Additionally, acknowledging and addressing feelings of depression and anxiety has become increasingly important. Engaging in therapy and leaning on my support system, including my therapist and close friends, has been crucial in navigating these feelings. It's a continuous process, and I am grateful for the tools and resources that help me maintain balance and resilience in the face of life's challenges.",

We try to stick to a strict grocery list to avoid unnecessary spending, and we split the costs for things like utilities and mortgage. My husband's income from his job helps cover the basics, and my salary from the gallery supplements it.
