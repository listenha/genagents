  "agent_profile_summary": "Theresa Mikell, a 44-year-old gallery curator from Princeton, New Jersey, grew up in Yugoslavia before immigrating to the U.S. at age six. Her decision to pursue an art education over a more stable academic path in high school, despite the financial risks, shaped her career and values, leading her to a graduate degree and a fulfilling role in the arts. Married with two children, she balances her work with family life, often prioritizing community involvement and her children’s development. A committed advocate for the arts, she curates exhibitions that bring her community together, while also relying on her close-knit family and friends for support. Her life reflects a continuous negotiation between creative passion and practical responsibility, evident in how she manages her time, nurtures her children’s talents, and maintains a strong sense of connection to both her heritage and her present."
