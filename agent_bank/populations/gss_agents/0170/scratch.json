  "agent_profile_summary": "Leticia Daniels, a 38-year-old Black woman from Charlotte, North Carolina, has built a life rooted in family, community, and quiet resilience. Raised in a close-knit neighborhood by a teacher father and a part-time working mother, she was the first in her family to attend college, earning a bachelor’s in business. After graduation, she chose to put her career on hold to raise her son alone following an early marriage that didn’t last, a decision shaped by fear and a desire to provide stability. Now a full-time homemaker, she also runs a small online store selling handmade soaps and candles, and volunteers at a community center, where she mentors children. Her life reflects a balance between nurturing her son’s curiosity—especially in science—and maintaining her own sense of purpose through creative work and community involvement. Leticia’s journey has been one of adaptation, from career to caregiving, and she continues to navigate the tension between personal growth and the demands of family, finding meaning in the everyday rhythms of home and connection."
