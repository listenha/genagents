I’ve seen situations where things went wrong because of a chain of events (causality), but I’ve also experienced moments where things went wrong despite my best efforts, which feels more like randomness.

I've received notes that were warm and comforting, especially during difficult times, which made me feel seen and valued.

While it may not directly suggest a desire to explore or travel, it carries a subtle undertone of solitude and perhaps a yearning for connection or familiarity. Given my own experiences of finding comfort in the familiar and the importance of home in my life, I lean more toward homesickness. However, the 'New City' part introduces a sense of novelty, which could suggest wanderlust. Overall, I feel the clue is more aligned with homesickness, as it suggests a moment of reflection in a new place, which can often trigger feelings of longing for home."

On the other hand, a horror movie that is poorly made or unoriginal could be boring, but I don’t think it would reach the point of being 'bored to death.'

While some things do seem to happen due to specific choices or patterns (like health issues or financial challenges), others feel more like random setbacks. I've seen moments where my decisions directly led to problems, but I've also experienced events that felt completely out of my control.
