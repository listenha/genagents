He also mentions that he uses social media to stay connected, suggesting he is not extremely reserved. However, he also talks about finding solace in his own space and balancing his busy life, which hints at a more reserved nature. Given his balanced perspective and the importance he places on privacy and personal space, a middle ground seems appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Hassan appears to be someone who values trust and has a supportive family and community. He describes his relationships with his wife, friends, and colleagues positively and emphasizes the importance of community.

            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Hassan describes himself as a software engineer working at a tech startup. He mentions that his wife is a talented artist and graphic designer, but there is no indication that Hassan himself is involved in or interested in art.

While he acknowledges that his stress levels have been higher due to the launch of the new product at work, he also notes that he has been using these strategies to manage his stress. This suggests that while he does experience some nervousness, he is not overly anxious and has developed methods to cope with it. Therefore, it is more likely that he would lean towards a lower score on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Hassan seems to have a solid foundation in practical matters, such as his current career as a software engineer, which often requires a logical and analytical mindset.

His confidence in his ability to handle various tasks suggests that he is not overly pessimistic about his problem-solving skills. However, he also acknowledges that there have been moments of stress and that he relies on coping mechanisms, indicating that he may not view himself as exceptionally skilled at solving complicated problems.

Given his awareness of stress and the steps he's taking to manage it, a score of 3 seems appropriate, but leaning towards the higher end of the scale to reflect his efforts to improve.

While he is dedicated and hardworking, there are no explicit mentions of him being introverted or reserved. He talks about his family, work, and community with enthusiasm, suggesting he is more on the outgoing side. However, he also mentions that he values privacy and has moments of stress, which could indicate he might be more reserved than overtly extroverted. Given his balanced personality, 3 seems most appropriate, but since the scale leans towards the middle, 1 is slightly more fitting.",
