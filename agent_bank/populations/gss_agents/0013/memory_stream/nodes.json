Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nHassan Nguyen: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in China, but my family moved to San Francisco when I was just a toddler. My parents worked hard to give us a better life in America, even though they didn't have much education themselves. They both worked multiple jobs to support us, which meant we didn't get to spend as much time together as I would have liked. Despite that, they always made sure to instill in us the importance of education and hard work.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nHassan Nguyen: One such moment came when I was in high school. I had the opportunity to join a scholarship program that offered summer internships in tech companies. At first, I wasn't sure whether to apply because it meant leaving behind the comfort of home and spending the summer away from my family. But my parents encouraged me to take the chance, saying that it would open doors for me. It turned out to be a pivotal decision. Not only did I gain valuable experience, but I also discovered a passion for software development. That summer internship led me to pursue a degree in computer science, which has since become my career path. I'm grateful for that choice because it shaped my future and gave me a sense of direction.\n\n",

But at the same time, I was also eager to explore new opportunities and prove to myself that I could succeed outside of what was expected of me. That experience taught me a lot about taking risks and pursuing my passions, even when it means leaving familiar surroundings.\n\n",

The pivotal moment in high school, where I took the chance to intern in tech companies, not only introduced me to my passion for software development but also set the course for my future. This decision, influenced by both external encouragement and internal ambition, taught me the importance of stepping out of my comfort zone and pursuing my dreams.

I've started meditating in the morning to help calm my mind before starting the day.

Our biggest expenses are housing, groceries, and education for the kids. Rent is pretty steep in Pacific Heights, but we're fortunate to have a good support system in terms of community resources and occasional financial help from my parents. Groceries can add up quickly, especially with the extra costs of organic options that we prefer for the kids' health. Education is a priority, so we spend quite a bit on extracurricular activities and school supplies. Thankfully, we've been able to save a bit for the future, and I try to put aside some money for emergency situations.\n\n",

We spend about $500 on Ali and Aria's education, including tutoring and extracurricular activities. Health insurance and other miscellaneous expenses round out the remaining $1,200.

Then, during the holiday season in December, we spent more on gifts and festive decorations.

    "content": "Completing this interview and reflecting on my life story has been both enlightening and humbling. It's clear that my life has been shaped by a series of significant moments, from my childhood in China and the sacrifices made by my parents to give us a better life in America, to the pivotal decision to intern in tech companies during high school, which set the course for my career path. The support and encouragement from my family, especially my wife Li Wei and our children Ali and Aria, have been indispensable. Their love and understanding have helped me navigate the challenges of balancing a demanding career with family life. The assistance from external sources, such as the scholarship program and community centers, has also played a crucial role in guiding me through my early career. Living in Pacific Heights has provided a sense of safety and belonging, and the tight-knit community has been a source of comfort and support. Reflecting on this interview, I realize that my life journey is a testament to the importance of perseverance, hard work, and the power of community. It's a reminder that no matter how challenging life may seem, with the right support and a clear sense of purpose, one can achieve great things and create a fulfilling life.",
