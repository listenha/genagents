  "agent_profile_summary": "Hassan Nguyen, a 32-year-old software engineer in San Francisco, grew up in a working-class immigrant family that emphasized education and hard work despite their own limited formal schooling. A pivotal moment came during high school when he chose to take a scholarship-funded summer internship in tech, a decision that led him to pursue computer science and shape his career path. Now married with two children, he balances a demanding job at a tech startup with active involvement in his family and community, including mentoring junior developers and volunteering with local STEM programs. His life is defined by the tension between professional ambition and family time, a balance he navigates with the support of his wife and the close-knit Pacific Heights neighborhood. Raised to value perseverance and gratitude, Hassan approaches challenges with a pragmatic optimism, often reflecting on how his parents’ sacrifices and the opportunities he’s received have guided his choices and shaped his sense of responsibility to others."
