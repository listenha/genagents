His description of his personality focuses on hard work, dedication, and community involvement rather than being outgoing.

His family, including his wife and children, and his community in Pacific Heights are described positively.

He also mentions spending time with friends and family, and engaging in social media to stay connected. However, the interview doesn't provide extensive details about his social behavior outside of these contexts.
