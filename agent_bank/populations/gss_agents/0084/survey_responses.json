However, she has also taken steps to manage these feelings, such as attending therapy and practicing mindfulness. While she acknowledges the presence of stress, she seems to have developed coping mechanisms that allow her to handle it reasonably well.

She has described herself as a social worker who works in a field that requires empathy and interpersonal skills, but she has also shown a willingness to engage in mindfulness and other activities that require cognitive flexibility. This suggests she is neither overly confident nor overly uncertain about her logical abilities, but rather somewhere in the middle.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Alicia describes herself as a moderate in political views and emphasizes the importance of empathy and community in her life. While she appreciates the value of logic in her work as a social worker, her responses suggest she places equal importance on human connection and support.

However, her openness to exploring different perspectives and her experience with diverse communities also indicate a willingness to consider multiple approaches. Given these factors, it is reasonable to predict that she would not fully dismiss the effectiveness of logic in problem-solving.",

She mentions enjoying activities like hiking and visiting museums, which suggests she is not overly reserved. However, she does value her personal space and self-care, indicating she is not entirely extroverted either.
