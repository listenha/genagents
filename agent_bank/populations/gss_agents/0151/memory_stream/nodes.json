Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nEmily Johnson: I was born in Madison, Wisconsin, and I've lived here most of my life. My childhood wasn't easy. My parents were divorced when I was young, and we struggled financially. My mom worked a lot of hours at a local grocery store, and my dad wasn't really around after the divorce. We lived in a small apartment, and I remember always being aware of money \u2014 never having enough for things other kids took for granted. I was raised Catholic, but I haven't been religious since I was a teenager. I graduated high school, but I didn't go to college because I couldn't afford it, and I didn't have much support to help me figure out what I wanted to do next. I tried a few jobs, but nothing really stuck. I've been laid off a couple of times, and it's been tough trying to find steady work. I'm still figuring out my path, but I hope to get back on my feet soon.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nEmily Johnson: There was a moment when I was 17, right after high school, when I had to choose between staying in Madison or moving to another city with a cousin who had a job and was offering me a place to stay. I was really torn because I didn't want to leave my mom alone, but I also knew that if I stayed, I wouldn't have any direction. I remember sitting on the floor of our apartment, staring at the ceiling, thinking about what my life could be if I took that chance. In the end, I decided to stay, thinking I could figure things out later. That decision probably kept me from getting a foot in the door somewhere else, and it's something I think about often. I wonder what my life would be like if I had taken that risk.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nEmily Johnson: I think I made the choice consciously, even if it wasn't the easiest one. I remember feeling like I had to be strong for my mom, like leaving would be abandoning her. But deep down, I knew I was staying out of fear \u2014 fear of the unknown, fear of failing, fear of not being able to come back. I didn't want to admit that I was scared, so I told myself I was making the right decision. Looking back, I realize that fear held me back more than anything else. I wish I had been brave enough to take that chance, even if it meant being away from her for a while.\n\n",

But I didn't know where to turn. I felt like I was on my own, and I didn't want to bother anyone else with my problems. I guess I was too proud or too scared to ask for help. It's funny, though \u2014 I remember my mom tried to talk to me about it, but I just shut her down. I didn't want her to feel like I was leaving her behind, even though I knew I needed to grow.

She's been through a lot, and I feel like I've let her down in some ways. I try to stay in touch, but life has a way of pulling you in different directions. I have a few cousins who I keep in contact with, and they've been pretty supportive. One of them, the one I almost moved with when I was 17, still checks in on me sometimes. I guess I don't have a lot of people in my life, but the ones I do have, I value.

I remember him being around when I was really little, but after a while, he just faded out. I don't even know where he is now or if he's still in the country. I guess I don't think about him much, except for the occasional memory \u2014 like when I was sick as a kid and he stayed up with me, or when he taught me how to ride a bike.

One of them, Sarah, was like a sister to me \u2014 we used to hang out all the time, and she was always the one who encouraged me to dream bigger. She ended up going to college and is now working in social services, which is pretty cool. She's tried to check in on me from time to time, but I guess life got in the way. I feel bad about that, honestly. I know she cares, but I haven't been the best at staying connected. There's also this guy named Jake who I used to work with at the grocery store where my mom worked. We became pretty close for a while, but things kind of fizzled out when I got laid off. I think I was too focused on my own struggles to really invest in a relationship. I don't know \u2014 maybe I'm just not great at maintaining relationships. But I do miss having someone to talk to, someone who isn't just family. I guess I'm learning, though. I've started going to a community center sometimes, and there are a few people there who are nice and who I've started talking to. It's not the same as having close friends, but it's a start.\n\n",

It's not dangerous, not really, but you can tell it's been neglected for a while. There's a small park nearby where I sometimes sit and people-watch, just to clear my head. The community center I mentioned earlier is right across the street from my apartment, so that's been a good place to meet people. My apartment itself is pretty small, just one bedroom and a kitchen, but it's all I can afford right now. I like the quiet, though \u2014 it gives me space to think, to reflect on things.

But there's also a part of me that feels like I'm stuck \u2014 like no matter how safe it is, this neighborhood doesn't offer the kind of future I want.

People are pretty much like me \u2014 struggling, trying to make ends meet, figuring life out as we go. That sense of shared experience can be comforting, in a way.

Tell me all about how you have been feeling.\n\nEmily Johnson: The past year has been a mix of ups and downs, honestly. There were moments where I felt like I was finally starting to make progress \u2014 like when I began going to the community center more regularly, or when I started taking those online classes. It felt like I was taking control of my life in small ways, even if it wasn't dramatic or fast. But then there were other times when I felt like I was just going through the motions again, like I was stuck in this loop of trying to get by without really moving forward. I think the biggest thing that's changed for me is that I'm not as afraid to ask for help anymore. I used to think I had to do everything on my own, but I've started realizing that it's okay to lean on others \u2014 whether it's my mom, my friends, or even the people at the community center. I still have days where I feel overwhelmed, but I'm learning to be kinder to myself, to take things one step at a time, and to believe that even if progress is slow, it's still progress. I don't know what the future holds, but I'm trying to be more present in the moment, more open to change, and more hopeful that things can get better \u2014 not just for me, but for the people I care about too.\n\n",

I remember going to church every Sunday, learning about faith, and feeling like there was something bigger out there. But as I got older, especially after my parents' divorce and the struggles we had, I started to question a lot of things. It wasn't that I stopped believing in God, more like I stopped needing religion to make sense of the world. I think I got to a point where I realized that faith was more about the people around me \u2014 my mom, my friends, the small moments of kindness that kept me going \u2014 than about prayers or rituals. These days, I don't really think about religion much. I don't go to church, and I don't follow any specific spiritual practices. But I do believe in something \u2014 in the idea that people can change, that even in the hardest times, there's still hope.

Rent is the biggest chunk, and it's always tight, especially when I don't have steady hours at the caf\u00e9. I try to stretch my food budget by buying in bulk or going to the discount store, but sometimes I end up skipping meals or buying the cheapest options just to make it last.

For example, during the winter, the heating bill goes up, and I have to be extra careful with how much I use. I don't have a thermostat, just a basic heater, so I end up wearing more layers and trying to keep the apartment as warm as possible without turning it up too high. Then there's the grocery bill \u2014 it tends to go up around holidays or when I'm trying to make sure I have enough food for the week. I also noticed that when I was laid off for a few weeks, my income dropped, and that made everything feel even more stressful. I had to cut back on things like bus fare and even skipped some meals to make sure I could pay rent.

I'm learning that it's okay to ask for help, to take small steps, and to believe that even if progress is slow, it's still progress. I just hope I can keep moving forward, not just for myself, but for the people who believe in me too.",

Some weeks I bring in a little more, especially if I pick up extra shifts or do some odd jobs, but other weeks it's just enough to cover the basics. I don't really track it in detail, but I know that's pretty much what I'm working with most of the time. It's not a lot, but it's what I can manage right now \u2014 just enough to keep the lights on, buy groceries, and pay for the bus when I need to get to work or the community center. I guess I'm used to living on a tight budget, and I've learned to make it work, even if it's not always easy.\n\n",

It's not the kind of job that offers a lot of benefits \u2014 no health insurance, no paid time off, just a few days off here and there when they need me less. I used to think that having a job meant stability, but I've learned that's not always the case. The only thing I get is a small hourly wage and a few employee discounts, which I appreciate, but they don't really help much when you're trying to make ends meet. I've been at other jobs before, like the grocery store and the library, but none of them offered anything better. I guess that's just how it is for a lot of people in my situation \u2014 working hard, but not really getting the support or security that comes with it.

My manager is pretty straightforward \u2014 she doesn't really try to be friendly, but she's fair and knows when to give us a break. I don't think she's ever been particularly kind to me, but she also hasn't been cruel. The coworkers I have are mostly people I've known for a while, or at least I've seen around town. We don't really talk much outside of work, but when we do, it's usually about the job or something going on in the neighborhood. I don't know, maybe I'm just not the type of person who builds strong relationships at work. I think I've always been more focused on surviving than on connecting.

Some days I know I'll be there early in the morning, other days I might not have a shift at all. It depends on how busy the caf\u00e9 is, how many people are working, and sometimes even how the manager feels that week. I used to wish for more consistency, like having the same hours every week so I could plan better \u2014 plan when to go to the community center, when to visit my mom, or even when to take a walk in the park. But I've learned to roll with it, to be flexible even when it's hard. It's not ideal, but I guess it's part of the job. I've gotten used to it, even if I don't always like it.\n\n",

I don't know if I'll ever be in a better financial position, but I'm trying not to lose hope. I think the biggest thing is that I'm learning to be more patient with myself, to accept that change doesn't happen overnight, and to believe that even small steps \u2014 like saving a few dollars here and there or taking a class \u2014 can add up over time.
