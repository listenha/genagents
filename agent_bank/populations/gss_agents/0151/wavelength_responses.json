Even if the note is brief, the act of writing it by hand feels personal and meaningful. I’ve also written notes to others, and I know how much they can mean.

I see history as full of unpredictable events, and the dinosaurs are a prime example of that randomness."

While it might hint at a new experience, the imagery of candlelight suggests intimacy, comfort, and perhaps a longing for familiarity. Given my own experiences of feeling stuck in my current neighborhood and the emotional weight of being away from my mom, I associate this clue more with homesickness than wanderlust.

However, she has also shown moments of growth, like starting to engage with the community center, taking classes, and being more open with her mom. While she still feels some fear of missing out, she is learning to sit one out when needed, such as when she chooses to focus on her own well-being or when she steps back from social situations to reflect.

However, I also recognize that a note could be cold or impersonal if it was a reminder or a bill. But overall, I lean toward the idea that a hand-written note, especially in a personal context, is more likely to be warm and fuzzy. It represents a human touch that digital messages often lack."
