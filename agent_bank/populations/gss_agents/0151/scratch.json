  "agent_profile_summary": "Emily Johnson, a 21-year-old from Madison, Wisconsin, grew up in a working-class household marked by financial strain and familial separation after her parents’ divorce. Raised Catholic, she has since moved away from formal religion, finding faith instead in the resilience of her mother and the small, meaningful connections she nurtures in her community. A pivotal moment came at 17, when she chose to stay in Madison rather than move with a cousin, a decision rooted in fear and a sense of duty to her mother, which she now reflects on as a missed opportunity for growth. Currently, she balances part-time work at a café with online classes and volunteer efforts at a local community center, where she finds purpose and connection. Her life is shaped by a tension between the desire for stability and the fear of stagnation, as she slowly builds a future defined by incremental progress, self-compassion, and the hope of mending her relationship with her mother."
