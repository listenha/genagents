            "BFI-10_1": "Emily Johnson describes herself as someone who has struggled with asking for help, has been hesitant to open up to her mother, and has generally taken a quiet, introspective approach to life. She reflects on her past decisions with a sense of regret and self-awareness but doesn't often express her emotions outwardly. She also mentions not being the type to use social media for support and prefers face-to-face connections, which suggests a more reserved nature.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Emily has shared experiences of feeling isolated, having made decisions based on fear, and not asking for help even when needed. She has also described her relationships as limited, with a sense of distance from her father and a cautious, sometimes strained relationship with her mother. While she has started to open up and engage with others at the community center, her overall narrative suggests a general wariness or hesitation in trusting others fully, especially given her history of feeling stuck and unsupported.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Emily describes herself as someone who has struggled with financial instability, anxiety, and making decisions that could improve her life. However, she also shows a strong sense of self-awareness and a desire to grow, take small steps, and improve her situation. She is actively engaging with community resources, taking online classes, and reflecting on her past decisions. This indicates she sees herself as someone who is trying to be proactive and improve, rather than lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Emily has described experiencing anxiety, panic attacks, and struggles with stress, particularly during times of financial instability or uncertainty. She has also mentioned feeling overwhelmed and having difficulty coping at times, though she is working on improving her emotional coping strategies. While she is making progress, she has not yet reached a point where she consistently feels relaxed or handles stress well.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Emily does not mention any artistic interests or activities in her interview. She focuses on her struggles with employment, family, and daily survival. There is no indication that she engages in creative or artistic pursuits, nor does she express any interest in them. Her life seems centered around practical concerns rather than artistic expression.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Emily Johnson describes herself as having a small social circle and not being very active on social media. She mentions having a few friends from high school and a few people at the community center, but she also expresses feelings of isolation and a lack of close relationships. She often reflects on how she has been holding back and not being open with her mom or others. These descriptions suggest she is more reserved and not highly sociable.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Emily reflects on her life with a sense of self-awareness and empathy, particularly in her interactions with her mother, friends, and community. She acknowledges her own fears, shortcomings, and the impact of her decisions, but she does not express a tendency to criticize or find fault with others. Instead, she shows a willingness to grow, apologize, and seek support. She also values the people in her life and seems to focus on her own journey rather than judging others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Emily often describes her life as being on a tight budget, struggling with job stability, and feeling like she is just getting by. She has mentioned not always having the time or resources to focus on details, and she often reflects on how she has been holding back or not taking full advantage of opportunities. This suggests she may not see herself as someone who consistently does a thorough job, especially given the challenges she has faced in her life.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Emily has described experiencing anxiety and panic attacks, particularly during times of stress such as being laid off. She also mentioned struggling with fear and uncertainty in her past decisions, such as staying in Madison instead of moving with her cousin. These experiences suggest she is prone to feeling nervous or anxious in challenging situations, aligning her more with the higher end of the range.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Emily Johnson reflects on her life with a lot of introspection and emotional depth, but she does not express a strong inclination toward creative or imaginative thinking. Her narrative is more grounded in her experiences, struggles, and practical concerns. She does not mention engaging in creative activities or imagining alternate paths beyond her current reality in a way that would suggest an active imagination."

She expresses understanding of her mother's struggles and acknowledges the importance of support from others. She also shows empathy toward her past self and the choices she made, suggesting she is capable of understanding and relating to others' emotions.",
            "BES-A_2": "Emily Johnson has described her relationships as somewhat distant and has mentioned that she feels isolated at times. She has also reflected on her difficulty in maintaining close connections and being open with others. While she values the people in her life, she has acknowledged feeling disconnected from her mom and others, which suggests she may have difficulty reading emotional cues in others, including fear.",
            "BES-A_3": "Emily has shown a strong ability to reflect on her own emotions and the emotions of others, particularly in her relationship with her mother and the people she interacts with at the community center. She acknowledges her own struggles with anxiety and mental health, and she has also expressed understanding of her mother's sacrifices and challenges. This suggests she is emotionally aware and capable of empathizing with others' feelings.",
            "BES-A_4": "Emily has shown in the interview that she is emotionally aware and reflective, especially when it comes to her own fears and struggles. She also values connection and has expressed a desire to be more open and supportive of others, including her mom and friends. While she has struggled with anxiety and fear herself, she has also taken steps to care for her mental health and has started to engage more with others at the community center. This suggests she is capable of recognizing and responding to others' emotional states, even if she hasn't always done so in the past.",
            "BES-A_5": "Emily Johnson demonstrates a strong awareness of her own emotions and the emotions of others, especially in her reflections on her mother, her past decisions, and her interactions with people at the community center. She often acknowledges the feelings of others, such as her mother's struggles and the emotional impact of her own decisions. However, she also reflects on her own limitations in connecting with others and being open, which suggests she may not always be able to intuitively understand others’ emotions without them expressing them first.",
            "BES-A_6": "Emily Johnson describes herself as someone who has struggled with emotional awareness and social connection, particularly in her early life. She mentions feeling isolated, not always understanding her own emotions, and having difficulty maintaining close relationships. While she has made progress in connecting with others at the community center, she still seems to have moments of emotional distance and introspection. This suggests she may not be highly attuned to recognizing when others are cheerful, though she is not entirely disconnected from social cues.",
            "BES-A_7": "Emily Johnson describes her life as one marked by emotional struggles, including anxiety and a tendency to feel isolated. She also mentions difficulty with emotional openness, both with her mother and in her relationships. She does not appear to be particularly attuned to the emotional states of others, as she often feels disconnected and has not emphasized emotional awareness in her interactions with friends or family. Her emotional awareness seems limited, which aligns more with a lower score on this question.",
            "BES-A_8": "Emily mentions having a few friends from high school and a few people she interacts with at the community center, but she also reflects on not being great at maintaining relationships. She feels she has let people down and expresses a desire to be more open and connected. However, she also notes that she doesn’t always prioritize these connections, which suggests she may not be highly aware of her friends’ feelings.",
            "BES-A_9": "Emily has described having a limited social circle and feeling somewhat isolated, with only a few friends from high school and a few people at the community center. She also mentions feeling like she's been holding back from others and not being as open as she would like. This suggests she may not be very attuned to the emotional states of her friends, making it difficult for her to recognize when they are happy."

She has mentioned feeling stuck, not having clear direction, and making decisions based on fear or lack of support. These factors suggest she may feel less confident in her ability to solve complicated problems, especially given her limited resources and opportunities.",
            "REI_2": "Emily has described her life as one of struggle, limited resources, and emotional challenges. She has not mentioned any specific skills or experiences related to logical analysis or problem-solving, and her narrative suggests she often feels stuck or uncertain about her future. She has also mentioned anxiety and a lack of support, which may contribute to her feeling less confident in her ability to solve complex problems logically.",
            "REI_3": "Emily's interview suggests she tends to reflect on her life in emotional and narrative ways, often focusing on personal experiences, relationships, and feelings rather than logical or analytical frameworks. She discusses her struggles with anxiety, her decisions based on fear and emotional connections, and her reflections on her past in a deeply personal and introspective manner. There is little indication that she approaches her life or decisions through a highly analytical lens.",
            "REI_4": "Emily reflects on her life with a lot of introspection, showing that she is capable of thoughtful reasoning. She acknowledges her past decisions, evaluates her current situation, and contemplates her future with a sense of intentionality. While she admits to past fears and hesitation, she also demonstrates a growing ability to reflect on her actions and consider how to move forward. This suggests she does have some capacity for careful reasoning, even if she occasionally struggles with it.",
            "REI_5": "Emily has described experiencing anxiety, especially during times of uncertainty or when facing challenges like being laid off or struggling financially. She also mentioned having panic attacks and feeling overwhelmed at times, which suggests she may not reason well under pressure. Her reflections on her own struggles with fear and stress support the idea that she might find it difficult to think clearly when under pressure.",
            "REI_6": "Emily often reflects on her life with emotional insight and introspection, but she doesn't demonstrate a strong tendency to analyze situations in a highly logical or systematic way. She tends to focus on personal relationships, emotional well-being, and small steps toward progress rather than abstract or analytical reasoning. Her responses suggest she values emotional connection and personal growth over logical problem-solving as a primary strength.",
            "REI_7": "Emily's interview suggests she reflects deeply on her life, decisions, and emotions, often acknowledging her fears, limitations, and the impact of her environment. While she shows some introspection and self-awareness, there is no clear emphasis on systematic, logical thinking or problem-solving. Her responses are more emotional and narrative-driven, indicating a stronger reliance on intuition and personal experience than structured logic.",
            "REI_8": "Emily reflects on her life with a lot of introspection, often revisiting past decisions and considering how they shaped her current situation. She acknowledges moments of fear, hesitation, and regret, and she actively tries to understand her choices and their consequences. This suggests she is capable of and does engage in careful thinking, even if she sometimes feels stuck or uncertain. Her willingness to reflect and analyze her life indicates a tendency to think things through carefully.",
            "REI_9": "Emily reflects on her life with a lot of emotional insight and acknowledges her struggles with anxiety, fear, and decision-making. She often attributes her past choices to emotional factors like fear and lack of support, rather than logical reasoning. She also expresses uncertainty about her future and feels stuck in cycles, which suggests she may not consistently rely on logic to solve problems.",
            "REI_10": "Emily reflects frequently on her past decisions, often acknowledging that they were influenced by fear, lack of support, or uncertainty. She also shows a tendency to look back and analyze her choices, which suggests she is capable of reflecting on her reasoning. However, she also admits to making decisions out of fear or without clear direction, especially in her younger years. This suggests she may not always feel she has clear, explainable reasons for her decisions, especially in the past."

She has mentioned feeling isolated, not being very open with her mom, and avoiding deeper emotional conversations. She also mentions not being very active on social media and preferring face-to-face interactions over online ones. These behaviors and reflections suggest she may be more reserved in her self-perception.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Emily has shared a life marked by financial instability, personal struggles, and limited support systems. She has expressed feelings of being isolated, having made decisions out of fear, and not having asked for help even when needed. These experiences may have contributed to a cautious or guarded view of others, suggesting a lower level of general trust.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Emily has described her life as one of struggle, where she has faced financial hardship, limited educational opportunities, and emotional challenges. However, she has also shown a willingness to take small steps toward improvement, such as attending community classes, volunteering, and reflecting on her life. While she has faced obstacles, she does not appear to be lazy — rather, she is actively trying to improve her situation despite limited resources and support. She is aware of her challenges but is working to overcome them.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Emily has described experiencing anxiety, panic attacks, and struggling with stress, particularly after being laid off and during times of financial uncertainty. She has also mentioned that she is learning to manage her stress better through small steps like walking, journaling, and reaching out to others. However, she still feels overwhelmed at times and has not fully developed a consistent strategy for handling stress. This suggests she would not score a 5, but she is also not completely overwhelmed or unable to manage stress, so a 1 is too extreme. A score of 2 or 3 seems more accurate, but based on her recent efforts to manage stress, a 3 feels more aligned with her current state.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Emily's interview does not mention any engagement with artistic activities or interests. She describes her life as focused on survival, work, and basic needs, with little mention of hobbies, creative pursuits, or anything that suggests a strong interest in the arts. Her narrative centers around practical concerns, family, and community, but not artistic expression.",

She mentions feeling disconnected from others and not being great at maintaining relationships. She also admits to not being very active on social media and preferring face-to-face interactions over online ones. These details suggest she is more reserved and not highly sociable.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Emily Johnson's interview reveals a person who reflects on her own shortcomings and struggles with fear, anxiety, and self-doubt. She shows empathy toward her mother, acknowledges her own limitations, and expresses a desire to be more open and supportive. She does not demonstrate a tendency to find fault in others, but rather a tendency to be self-critical and to recognize her own fears and challenges. She seems to be more focused on her own growth and understanding of others rather than pointing out their faults.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Emily has described her life as one of struggle, inconsistency, and limited resources. She often mentions feeling stuck, not having enough support, and working part-time jobs with unpredictable hours. She also acknowledges that she hasn't always taken the best steps to improve her situation, such as not pursuing higher education or not being more proactive in seeking help. This suggests she may not see herself as someone who consistently does a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Emily has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, including panic attacks and feelings of being overwhelmed by stress. She has described moments where she felt stuck, worried about her future, and even called her mom in a moment of panic. These experiences align with a higher level of nervousness and anxiety, suggesting she would rate herself closer to the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Emily reflects on her life with a focus on her struggles, relationships, and small steps forward. While she does engage in introspection and has moments of reflection on what could have been, there is no explicit mention of her engaging in creative or imaginative thinking beyond her personal experiences and future hopes. Her narrative is more grounded in her reality, her past decisions, and her practical efforts to improve her life, rather than a vivid or expansive imagination."

She also expresses a desire to be more present for others and to build connections. However, she also acknowledges her own emotional struggles and the difficulty of asking for help, which might make it harder for her to fully understand others' feelings in a deeply empathetic way. She seems to have a moderate level of emotional awareness and connection, which would place her in the middle range.",

She mentions feeling isolated and not always being open with her mom or others. She also reflects on how she has been holding back and not fully engaging with people in her life.

She also shows empathy toward others in her life, such as her friends and community members. However, she does not explicitly mention being able to sense others' emotions before they are expressed.

            "REI_8": "Emily Johnson reflects on her life with a great deal of introspection and often considers her choices and their consequences. She discusses her past decisions, such as staying in Madison instead of moving with her cousin, and how she feels about them now. She also shows a willingness to reflect on her current situation, including her work, relationships, and future goals. This suggests that she is capable of and comfortable with careful thinking.",
            "REI_9": "Emily often reflects on her decisions with a sense of regret and acknowledges that fear and emotional barriers have influenced her choices. She has described moments where she felt stuck and made decisions based on fear rather than logic. While she is beginning to take small steps toward change, she does not demonstrate a strong reliance on logical reasoning as a primary tool for problem-solving in her life.",
            "REI_10": "Emily reflects on her decisions with a sense of introspection and acknowledges that some of her choices were driven by fear, lack of support, or uncertainty. She often describes making decisions based on emotional or situational factors, such as staying with her mom out of fear of abandonment or not seeking help due to pride. While she is becoming more reflective and aware of her choices, she still seems to view many of her decisions as being shaped by external pressures or emotional responses rather than clear, deliberate reasoning."

            "BFI-10_2": "Emily has shared a life marked by personal struggles, financial instability, and emotional challenges. She has expressed feelings of being isolated, having made decisions based on fear, and having difficulty asking for help. These experiences may have made her more cautious and less trusting of others. However, she also shows a willingness to connect with others, such as her mom, friends, and community center members, which suggests some level of trust. Still, her overall narrative leans toward a sense of being on her own and having to navigate life without much support, which aligns more with a lower score on trust.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Emily has described her life as one of struggle, where she has worked part-time jobs, taken online classes, and made efforts to improve her situation.

She mentions feeling isolated at times and not being great at maintaining relationships.

She often acknowledges her fears, limitations, and the ways she has let others down, but she does not express judgment or criticism toward others. Instead, she shows empathy and understanding, especially toward her mother and others in her life. She is more focused on her own growth and the challenges she has faced, rather than finding fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Emily often describes her life as one of struggle, survival, and making do with what she has. She works part-time at a café and does odd jobs, but she doesn’t describe her work as something she takes pride in or feels is thorough. She also mentions that she has not pursued further education or training and has taken a more passive approach to her future. This suggests she may not see herself as someone who does a thorough job, especially in a professional or structured sense.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Emily has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, including panic attacks, difficulty sleeping, and feeling overwhelmed by life's challenges.

            "BFI-10_10": "Emily's life story reflects a focus on practicality and survival rather than imagination or creativity. She describes her life in terms of daily struggles, financial constraints, and routine work. While she reflects on her past and contemplates her future, her narrative does not suggest a strong engagement with imagination or creative thinking. Her thoughts are more grounded in reality and survival."

            "BES-A_8": "Emily mentions having a few friends from high school and a few people she interacts with at the community center, but she also reflects on not being the best at maintaining relationships. She expresses a sense of loneliness and a desire for more meaningful connections, which suggests she is somewhat aware of her friends' feelings but may not always act on that awareness.

Her narrative suggests she relies more on intuition and emotional insight than on structured, logical reasoning.",
            "REI_7": "Emily's interview reflects a more introspective, emotional, and reflective approach to life. She often discusses her feelings, fears, and relationships in depth, and she frames many of her decisions as being influenced by emotions, past experiences, and the need for support. While she shows some ability to reflect on her life and make small, intentional steps, she does not emphasize logical reasoning or systematic problem-solving as a primary trait.

She also shows a tendency to analyze her life, her choices, and her relationships, which suggests she does engage in careful reasoning, even if it's not always perfect or immediate.",
            "REI_5": "Emily has described experiencing anxiety, particularly during times of financial instability or uncertainty. She has mentioned struggling with panic attacks, difficulty focusing, and feeling overwhelmed by life's challenges. These experiences suggest she may not reason well under pressure, especially when her mental health is impacted by stress and uncertainty.",
            "REI_6": "Emily often reflects on her life with emotional insight and introspection, but she does not emphasize logical reasoning or problem-solving as a strength. She describes her decisions as being influenced by fear, family obligations, and emotional connections, rather than a systematic or logical approach. She also acknowledges that she has struggled with anxiety and has not pursued formal education or training that would likely enhance her logical reasoning skills.",
            "REI_7": "Emily Johnson's interview suggests she often makes decisions based on emotions, fears, and personal connections rather than structured reasoning. She reflects on her past choices with regret and acknowledges that fear and emotional ties influenced her decisions, such as staying in Madison instead of moving with her cousin. She also describes her current life as one of survival and incremental progress, rather than strategic planning. These traits align more with someone who relies on intuition and emotional insight rather than logical analysis.",
            "REI_8": "Emily reflects on her past decisions with a great deal of introspection, especially when discussing her choice to stay in Madison at 17. She often looks back on her life with a critical eye, analyzing her fears, regrets, and missed opportunities. This suggests she does engage in careful thinking, even if it sometimes leads to feelings of regret or hesitation. Her thoughtful nature is evident in how she processes her experiences and considers how they shaped her present.",
            "REI_9": "Emily reflects on her life with a lot of emotional and introspective thinking, often acknowledging her struggles with anxiety, fear, and uncertainty. She emphasizes small steps, emotional connections, and personal growth over structured, logical problem-solving. She does not appear to rely heavily on logic to navigate her life, instead focusing on emotional resilience and gradual progress.",
            "REI_10": "Emily often reflects on her decisions, especially in interviews, and acknowledges that many of her choices were influenced by fear, lack of support, or external pressures. She also expresses a desire to understand her motivations better and has started to engage in self-reflection and small steps toward change. However, she also admits to making decisions based on fear and uncertainty, particularly around the choice to stay in Madison at 17. This suggests she does not always have clear, explainable reasons for her decisions, but is working toward having them."

She also mentions that she prefers face-to-face connections over social media, indicating a preference for meaningful, but not necessarily frequent, interactions. While she is not explicitly described as reserved, her tendency to hold back, avoid deep conversations, and reflect on her fear of abandonment or failure suggests a more reserved nature.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Emily has shared a life marked by financial instability, familial separation, and a lack of consistent support. She has expressed feelings of isolation, fear of the unknown, and a tendency to carry things on her own. These experiences suggest a cautious approach to trust, as she has likely been let down or felt unsupported in the past. While she has made efforts to connect with others, such as through the community center, she also reflects on moments of fear and hesitation, which align more with a lower level of trust.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Emily has described her life as one of struggle, where she is trying to make progress despite financial and emotional challenges. She has taken steps to improve her situation, such as attending classes, volunteering, and seeking support. She reflects on her past decisions and acknowledges areas where she could have been more proactive, but she is clearly working to change. She does not describe herself as lazy or avoiding effort — rather, she frames her challenges as stemming from fear, lack of support, and external circumstances.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Emily has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, panic attacks, and feeling overwhelmed by stress. She has described feeling stuck, financially strained, and emotionally burdened by her past decisions and current circumstances. While she is making efforts to manage her stress through small steps like going to the community center, taking classes, and journaling, she has not yet demonstrated a strong sense of relaxation or confidence in handling stress effectively. Her self-reported experiences align more with a lower score on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Emily does not mention any artistic interests or activities in her interview. She focuses on her work, family, and community involvement, which are more practical and less creative in nature. There is no indication that she engages in or values artistic pursuits.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Emily describes herself as having a small social circle and not being very active on social media. She mentions having a few friends from high school and a few people at the community center, but she also reflects on feeling isolated and not being great at maintaining relationships. She doesn't seem to seek out large social interactions or describe herself as naturally sociable or outgoing.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Emily Johnson's interview reveals a person who reflects on her own shortcomings and struggles with self-compassion and growth. She often acknowledges her own fears, limitations, and past decisions without placing blame on others. She also shows empathy and understanding toward her mother, coworkers, and others in her life, indicating a tendency to be more forgiving and less judgmental. She does not come across as someone who frequently finds fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Emily often describes her life as being in a state of survival, where she is focused on getting by rather than excelling. She has mentioned feeling stuck, struggling with consistency in work hours, and not always having the resources or motivation to focus on quality. While she is trying to improve and take small steps, she doesn’t present herself as someone who consistently completes tasks with thoroughness or precision.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Emily has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, including panic attacks and difficulty managing stress. She has described feeling overwhelmed by financial instability, fear of the future, and emotional tension with her mother. These experiences suggest she is prone to nervousness and anxiety, aligning her more with the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Emily's life experiences suggest she is more grounded in practical realities, such as financial struggles, part-time work, and daily survival. While she reflects on her past and contemplates her future, there is little indication that she engages in imaginative or creative thinking as a defining trait. Her focus is on making ends meet, improving her situation incrementally, and maintaining relationships, which are more practical concerns than imaginative ones."

Her empathy is present but not consistently strong.",

She has also reflected on her difficulty in maintaining close connections and being open with others, including her mother. While she values connection, she also acknowledges that she is not always in tune with others' emotions, as seen in her reflections on her own struggles with anxiety and her difficulty in maintaining close friendships. This suggests she may find it hard to recognize when others are frightened.",
            "BES-A_3": "Emily has shown a strong ability to reflect on her own emotions and the emotions of others, particularly in her relationship with her mother and the people she interacts with at the community center. She expresses understanding of her mother's struggles and her own emotional challenges, indicating a capacity for empathy. While she has had moments of emotional isolation and fear, she has also demonstrated the ability to connect with others and show compassion, which suggests a moderate to high level of empathy.",

However, she also describes feeling isolated and not always connected to others, suggesting she may not always be able to intuit others' emotions without explicit communication. Her introspection and emotional depth suggest some level of empathy, but her tendency to feel disconnected and her own emotional struggles may limit her ability to consistently read others' feelings.",
            "BES-A_6": "Emily has described feeling emotionally isolated and struggling with anxiety, which may make it harder for her to notice or interpret others' emotional cues. She also mentioned that she doesn't use social media much and has limited close relationships, which could reduce her exposure to and practice in reading others' emotions. However, she has started to engage more with people at the community center, which might improve her ability to recognize others' moods over time. Still, based on her current emotional state and self-reported challenges, it's more likely she would score lower on this scale.",

She also mentions feeling disconnected from others at times and not being the type to rely on social media for support.

            "BES-A_8": "Emily has mentioned having a few friends from high school and a few people she interacts with at the community center, but she also expressed feelings of isolation and difficulty maintaining close relationships. She reflects on not being the best at staying connected and admits to feeling like she’s missed opportunities for deeper connections.

She acknowledges her own limitations, such as not having a college degree or steady work, and has expressed a sense of being overwhelmed by the challenges in her life.

Her responses suggest she may feel less confident in these areas.",

She often discusses her emotions, relationships, and personal growth in a reflective and introspective way, rather than breaking down problems into structured, logical components. She doesn’t describe herself as someone who systematically evaluates options or uses data to make decisions. Instead, she focuses on feelings, small steps, and personal connections, which aligns more with a non-analytical thinker.",
            "REI_4": "Emily has shown moments of reflection and self-awareness, such as when she discusses her decision to stay in Madison at 17 and how fear held her back. She also reflects on her life, health, and relationships with thoughtful consideration. While she acknowledges her struggles with anxiety and uncertainty, she also demonstrates an ability to analyze her situation and consider her options, even if she feels stuck. This suggests she does engage in some level of careful reasoning, though it may not always be her strongest point.",
            "REI_5": "Emily has described experiencing anxiety, especially during times of instability such as being laid off or struggling financially. She has also mentioned moments of panic and difficulty coping with stress, which suggests she may not reason well under pressure.

While she does show some awareness of her circumstances and is beginning to take small, intentional steps, she does not emphasize logic or structured problem-solving as a primary method for navigating her life. Instead, she leans on personal connections, community support, and emotional resilience. This suggests she may not view logic as the most effective tool for her.",

            "REI_1": "Emily has described moments in her life where she felt stuck, made decisions based on fear, and struggled with uncertainty. She has also mentioned feeling like she's been holding back, not asking for help, and not always knowing how to move forward. These reflections suggest she may not feel confident in her ability to solve complicated problems on her own, especially when she has faced financial, emotional, and personal challenges without much support.",
            "REI_2": "Emily has described her life as one marked by financial strain, limited educational opportunities, and a lack of consistent support. While she has shown some initiative in taking small steps like attending classes and volunteering, she also reflects on past decisions made out of fear and a lack of guidance. This suggests she may not feel confident in her ability to engage in careful logical analysis, especially in complex or high-stakes situations.",
            "REI_3": "Emily reflects on her life with a focus on emotions, personal experiences, and relationships. She often describes her decisions as being influenced by feelings, fears, and connections with others rather than logical analysis. She doesn’t emphasize problem-solving or structured thinking in her responses, and her narrative is more introspective and emotional. This suggests she would align more with the idea that she is not a very analytical thinker.",
            "REI_4": "Emily reflects on her life with a lot of self-awareness and introspection, often looking back on decisions and considering their impact. She has moments of self-doubt and has acknowledged her fear of the unknown, but she also shows a willingness to reflect and grow. While she doesn't always act on her reflections immediately, she does engage in thoughtful processing, especially when it comes to her relationships and personal development. This suggests she has some capacity for careful reasoning, though she may not always act on it immediately.",
            "REI_5": "Emily has described experiencing anxiety, especially during times of instability or uncertainty, such as after being laid off or when facing financial stress. She has also mentioned struggling with mental health, including panic attacks and difficulty managing stress. These factors suggest she may not reason well under pressure, as she has acknowledged feeling overwhelmed and struggling to cope with stress.",
            "REI_6": "Emily reflects on her life with a sense of introspection and emotional awareness, often acknowledging her fears, struggles, and the influence of her environment on her decisions. She does not describe herself as particularly analytical or logical in her decision-making, instead emphasizing emotional and relational factors. She also acknowledges moments of uncertainty and the impact of external circumstances, which suggests she may not see herself as particularly strong in logical reasoning.",
            "REI_7": "Emily's interview suggests she is more reflective, emotional, and introspective rather than analytical or logical. She often talks about her feelings, fears, and relationships in a way that emphasizes emotional depth and personal experience over structured reasoning. She also describes her life in terms of small, incremental steps and emotional growth rather than strategic planning or logical analysis.",
            "REI_8": "Emily often reflects on her past decisions, such as staying in Madison at 17, and acknowledges that fear and lack of support influenced her choices. She also mentions struggling with anxiety and feeling overwhelmed by her current situation, which suggests she may not always feel comfortable or capable of thinking things through carefully. While she is reflective and self-aware, her narrative shows that she sometimes feels stuck or overwhelmed, which may make careful thinking more difficult for her.",
            "REI_9": "Emily often reflects on her life with a sense of introspection and emotional awareness, but she also acknowledges her struggles with decision-making and fear-based choices. While she has started to take small steps toward growth and self-reflection, there is no clear indication that she relies heavily on logic to solve her problems. Instead, she seems to rely more on emotional insight, small actions, and support from others.",
            "REI_10": "Emily reflects on her decisions, especially significant ones like staying in Madison at 17, and often attributes them to emotional or situational factors like fear, duty, or lack of support. She acknowledges that some of her choices were made out of fear or uncertainty, and she often looks back on them with a sense of regret or ambiguity. While she has moments of clarity, she also expresses a sense of being stuck or unsure about her path, which suggests her decisions are not always clear or explainable in hindsight."

She also mentions that she prefers face-to-face connections over social media, and she reflects on how she has been holding back from her mom and others. These behaviors and reflections suggest that she is more reserved in her interactions and self-expression.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Emily has shared a life marked by financial instability, emotional struggles, and a sense of isolation. She has described feeling stuck, having made decisions out of fear, and not always feeling supported by others. While she values the people in her life, such as her mother and the community center, she also reflects on moments of distance, missed opportunities, and a lack of support. These experiences suggest a cautious approach to trust, rather than an open or optimistic one.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Emily describes herself as someone who is actively trying to improve her life, even if progress is slow. She talks about taking small steps, like attending classes, volunteering, and trying to manage her mental health. She also reflects on past decisions and is working to be more open, honest, and brave. These behaviors suggest she does not see herself as lazy but rather as someone who is working through challenges and striving to grow.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Emily has spoken extensively about her struggles with anxiety, including panic attacks, difficulty sleeping, and feeling overwhelmed by financial and emotional stress. She has also described feeling stuck, worried about the future, and struggling with the unpredictability of her life. These experiences suggest that she does not see herself as someone who handles stress well or is relaxed in the face of challenges.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Emily does not mention any artistic interests or activities in her interview. Her life seems focused on survival, work, and community involvement, with no indication of engaging in creative or artistic pursuits. She describes her life in practical terms and does not reflect on art or creativity as part of her identity or daily routine.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Emily describes herself as someone who values connection but also acknowledges that she has struggled with maintaining close relationships. She mentions having a few friends from high school but feels distant from them, and she is more focused on her immediate family and the people at the community center. She also mentions that she doesn't use social media much and prefers face-to-face interactions. While she values connection, she also shows signs of being more introspective and cautious in social situations, which suggests she may not see herself as highly outgoing or sociable.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Emily reflects on her past decisions with self-awareness and compassion, particularly regarding her relationship with her mother and her own fears and limitations. She shows empathy toward others, including her mother, coworkers, and community members. She does not exhibit tendencies to find fault with others, instead focusing on her own growth and the need for support. Her narrative is rooted in self-reflection and understanding rather than judgment.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Emily often describes her work as part-time, inconsistent, and not particularly meaningful or structured. She mentions working at a café and doing odd jobs, and she doesn't seem to have a strong sense of pride or satisfaction in her work. She also reflects on her life with a sense of being stuck or going through the motions, which suggests she may not see herself as someone who does a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Emily has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, including panic attacks and feelings of being overwhelmed by life's challenges. She has described moments of intense worry, such as after being laid off, and has acknowledged that her mental health has been a significant struggle. These experiences align with someone who sees themselves as getting nervous easily.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Emily reflects on her life with a focus on practical realities, survival, and incremental progress. While she does engage in some introspection and has moments of hope or imagination (like imagining a better future for herself or her mother), her narrative is rooted in her current struggles and the tangible steps she is taking to improve her life. She does not describe herself as someone who often engages in fantasy or creative imagination, but rather someone who is learning to be present and take small, realistic steps forward."

She reflects on her past decisions with self-awareness and shows understanding of others' struggles, such as her mother's sacrifices and the challenges faced by others in her neighborhood. She also expresses care for her friends and community members, indicating she is capable of understanding and relating to others' emotions, including their happiness.",
            "BES-A_2": "Emily has described her relationships as limited, with few close friends and a focus on small, surface-level interactions. She mentions feeling isolated and not having many people in her life, which suggests she may not have developed strong emotional attunement to others. She also reflects on her own struggles with anxiety and emotional awareness, which may make it harder for her to recognize similar emotions in others.",
            "BES-A_3": "Emily has shown a deep awareness of her own emotional struggles, including anxiety, fear, and feelings of isolation. She also reflects on the emotional states of others, such as her mother and friends, and has expressed a desire to be more open and supportive. Her ability to reflect on her own emotions and the emotions of others suggests a moderate to high level of empathy.",
            "BES-A_4": "Emily has described her relationships as limited and often strained, particularly with her mother, whom she feels distant from. She also mentions struggling with anxiety and emotional coping, which suggests she may not be very in tune with others' emotional states, including her friends'. She hasn't demonstrated a strong ability to support others emotionally in the interview, and her focus has been more on her own struggles than on others'.",
            "BES-A_5": "Emily describes herself as someone who has struggled with emotional connection and has often felt isolated or disconnected. She mentions not being very open with her mother and having limited close relationships. While she has started to engage more with others at the community center, she does not demonstrate a strong ability to intuitively understand others' emotions. Her reflections suggest she is more focused on her own struggles than on reading others' feelings.",
            "BES-A_6": "Emily Johnson shows some awareness of others' emotions, particularly in her interactions with her mother and friends. However, she also describes feeling isolated and struggling with emotional connection at times. She doesn't explicitly mention being able to interpret others' cheerfulness, but her introspective nature and ability to reflect on relationships suggest she is somewhat socially aware. However, her tendency to feel stuck and emotionally distant may make it harder for her to consistently recognize or respond to others' cheerful moods.",
            "BES-A_7": "Emily describes herself as someone who has struggled with emotional awareness, both in her own life and in her relationships. She mentions feeling disconnected from others at times and having difficulty maintaining close relationships. She also reflects on how she has been 'holding back' and not being fully present in her interactions, which suggests she may not be very attuned to the emotional states of others, including her friends.",
            "BES-A_8": "Emily has mentioned having a few friends from high school and a few people she interacts with at the community center, but she also reflects on feeling distant from them and not being great at maintaining relationships. She admits to not being in touch as much as she would like and feels bad about it. This suggests she may not be highly aware of her friends' feelings or may struggle with emotional connection.",
            "BES-A_9": "Emily has mentioned having a small social circle and not being very active on social media. She values the people in her life but admits to struggling with maintaining close relationships. She also described feeling isolated at times and not being very connected with others beyond her family and a few people at the community center. This suggests she may not be very attuned to the emotional states of her friends, which aligns with a lower score."

While she shows determination and a willingness to take small steps toward improvement, she has not demonstrated a strong focus on logical analysis or problem-solving in her narrative. Her reflections are more introspective and emotional, and she has not mentioned engaging in tasks that require complex logical reasoning. This suggests she may not view herself as strong in this area.",
            "REI_3": "Emily reflects on her life with emotional depth and introspection, often focusing on personal connections, feelings, and small steps toward growth. She does not emphasize logical planning or systematic thinking in her narrative. Instead, she describes her life through emotional and relational lenses, suggesting she may not identify as an analytical thinker.",
            "REI_4": "Emily reflects on her life with a great deal of introspection and self-awareness, often considering her decisions and their consequences. She has taken time to reflect on her past choices, such as staying in Madison at 17, and has shown a willingness to analyze her emotions and actions.

She has mentioned experiencing panic attacks and struggling with anxiety, which suggests she may not reason well under pressure. Her tendency to feel stuck, fear failure, and avoid risks also aligns with difficulty in reasoning under pressure.",
            "REI_6": "Emily often reflects on her life with emotional insight and introspection, focusing on personal growth, relationships, and emotional well-being. While she is thoughtful and self-aware, she does not emphasize logical reasoning or problem-solving as a key strength. Her narrative is more about emotional resilience, small steps, and personal connections rather than structured or analytical thinking.",
            "REI_7": "Emily's narrative reflects a more intuitive and emotionally driven approach to life, shaped by personal experiences, relationships, and emotional challenges. She often reflects on her decisions in terms of feelings, fears, and connections with others rather than logical analysis or structured reasoning. While she does show some self-awareness and planning (e.g., taking online classes, tracking expenses), her overall perspective seems more grounded in emotional and relational experiences than in systematic logic.",
            "REI_8": "Emily often reflects on her past decisions, such as her choice to stay in Madison at 17, and she frequently contemplates her future and how to move forward. She also shows a tendency to analyze her situation, such as evaluating her financial state, work schedule, and mental health.

            "REI_9": "Emily often reflects on her life with emotional and introspective thinking, acknowledging her fears, past decisions, and the influence of relationships and environment. While she is aware of her struggles and has begun to take small steps toward change, her narrative emphasizes emotional processing, intuition, and the importance of community over structured problem-solving.

She acknowledges that her decision was driven by fear and a sense of duty, and she now sees it as a missed opportunity. This suggests she can reflect on her decisions and understand the reasoning behind them, though she also acknowledges uncertainty and regret. She is self-aware and capable of explaining her choices, even if she feels they were not the best ones."

She has described feeling stuck, struggling with anxiety, and having moments where she felt abandoned or unsupported. These experiences may have made her more cautious or guarded in her interactions with others. While she has shown some openness in her relationships (e.g., with her mother and community center connections), there is also a theme of fear, hesitation, and a lack of trust in systems or people to provide support. This suggests she is more likely to score on the lower end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Emily has described her life as one of struggle, but also of effort and small steps toward progress. She works part-time, takes online classes, volunteers, and reflects on her life with a sense of intentionality.

She has described moments where she felt stuck, unable to move forward, and has admitted to not handling stress well in the past. While she has made progress in learning coping strategies, such as walking, journaling, and seeking support, she still identifies with feelings of being overwhelmed and stressed. This suggests she would not score high on this scale.",

She seems to be more self-reflective and understanding of others, which aligns with a lower score on this question.",

She has mentioned struggling with consistency in work hours, financial planning, and even her own personal growth.

While she values connection and has started to engage more with her community, she also reflects on past decisions where she chose to stay with her mother out of fear and a sense of duty rather than seeking her own growth.

            "REI_1": "Emily has described feeling stuck in cycles, struggling with financial instability, and making decisions based on fear or lack of support. She also mentions feeling overwhelmed at times and needing to take small steps to manage her life. These reflections suggest she may not feel confident in her ability to solve complex problems, especially when they involve long-term planning or navigating systemic barriers.",
            "REI_2": "Emily has described her life as one marked by financial strain, emotional challenges, and limited opportunities. She has not pursued higher education or specialized training, and her work is primarily part-time and low-skilled. While she shows some self-awareness and a desire to improve, she has not demonstrated a strong focus on logical analysis or problem-solving in a structured, analytical way. Her responses suggest she may not see herself as particularly skilled in this area.",
            "REI_3": "Emily's interview reflects a more intuitive and reflective approach to life, with a focus on emotional experiences, relationships, and personal growth rather than systematic or logical analysis. She often speaks in terms of feelings, small steps, and emotional connections, rather than structured planning or analytical reasoning. This suggests she is more aligned with the idea that she is not a very analytical thinker.",
            "REI_4": "Emily often reflects on her decisions and the consequences of her choices, such as when she discusses her decision to stay in Madison at 17 and how it impacted her life. She also shows a willingness to think through her future and consider small steps toward improvement, which suggests she does engage in careful reasoning, even if she feels uncertain or overwhelmed at times.",
            "REI_5": "Emily has described experiencing anxiety, particularly during times of financial instability, job loss, and personal uncertainty. She has also mentioned feeling overwhelmed and struggling with self-doubt, which suggests she may not reason well under pressure. Her tendency to feel stuck, her history of making decisions based on fear, and her acknowledgment of mental health challenges all support the idea that she would likely agree with this statement.",
            "REI_6": "Emily often reflects on her life with a sense of introspection and emotional awareness, but she does not demonstrate a strong emphasis on logical reasoning or systematic problem-solving. She tends to focus on personal growth, relationships, and emotional well-being rather than analytical or logical approaches. Her narrative is more about emotional resilience and small steps toward progress, not about structured or logical thinking.",
            "REI_7": "Emily reflects on her life with a strong emotional and introspective lens, often focusing on feelings, relationships, and personal growth. She describes her struggles with anxiety, her relationship with her mother, and her efforts to find meaning in small steps. While she does show some problem-solving behavior (e.g., taking classes, volunteering), her narrative is more rooted in emotional resilience and connection rather than logical or systematic thinking. This suggests she is more likely to identify with a lower score on this statement.",
            "REI_8": "Emily often reflects on her past decisions, such as choosing to stay in Madison at 17, and acknowledges that she made choices out of fear or lack of support. She also shows a willingness to reflect on her current situation, such as evaluating her job, health, and relationships. This suggests she does engage in careful thinking, even if it's not always easy or consistent.",
            "REI_9": "Emily reflects on her life with a sense of introspection and acknowledges her struggles with fear, anxiety, and uncertainty. She often describes decisions made out of fear or lack of support, and she emphasizes emotional and relational factors over structured logic. While she has started to take small, intentional steps (like attending classes or volunteering), she does not describe using logic as a primary tool for problem-solving. Instead, she focuses on emotional growth, small progress, and the support of others.",
            "REI_10": "Emily reflects frequently on her decisions, often looking back on past choices with a sense of regret or curiosity about what might have been. She is aware of the emotional and situational factors that influenced her decisions, such as fear, lack of support, and financial strain. While she is not always clear on her reasoning at the time, she is able to explain and analyze her decisions in hindsight, which suggests she has some level of self-awareness and intentionality."

She also mentions that she doesn't use social media much and prefers face-to-face interactions, which suggests she is not naturally inclined to be open or expressive. She also reflects on how she shut down her mother when she was younger and how she has only recently started to open up more. These behaviors and reflections align more with being reserved rather than outgoing.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Emily has shared experiences of feeling isolated, having made decisions based on fear, and having a strained relationship with her mother. She also mentions not having many close friends and feeling like she has been carrying things on her own. These factors suggest a level of wariness or caution in trusting others, which aligns more with a lower score on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Emily has described her life as one of struggle, where she is working part-time, trying to take online classes, and volunteering. She reflects on past decisions and acknowledges her fears and challenges, but also shows a clear desire to improve and move forward. She is actively trying to make small changes in her life, such as attending classes and engaging with her community. This indicates a sense of motivation and effort, even if progress is slow.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Emily has described experiencing anxiety, panic attacks, and difficulty managing stress, particularly after being laid off. She also mentions that she used to push through stress on her own and only recently started seeking small coping strategies like walks, journaling, and talking to others. While she is making progress, she still feels overwhelmed at times and has not fully developed a consistent way to handle stress well.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Emily does not mention any artistic interests or activities in her interview. She focuses on practical matters like work, family, and survival, and there is no indication that she engages in creative or artistic pursuits. Her life seems to be centered around stability and basic needs rather than self-expression or creativity.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Emily describes herself as someone who has a small circle of close friends and values the people she has in her life, but she also acknowledges that she struggles with maintaining relationships and feels like she's not great at it. She mentions feeling isolated at times and not being the type to use social media for support. While she values connection, she also reflects on how she has been holding back and not fully engaging with others. This suggests she may not see herself as highly outgoing or sociable.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Emily's interview reveals a person who reflects on her own shortcomings, fears, and decisions with self-awareness and self-compassion. She often acknowledges her own struggles and the impact of her choices, but does not express a tendency to judge or find fault with others. In fact, she emphasizes the importance of connection, empathy, and learning from others, including her mother and community. There is no indication that she is critical or judgmental of others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Emily often describes her life as one of struggle, uncertainty, and making do with what she has. She mentions working part-time at a café with inconsistent hours and not having a clear career path. She also reflects on past decisions that she feels were made out of fear or lack of support. These factors suggest she may not see herself as someone who consistently does a thorough job, especially given her financial and emotional challenges.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Emily has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, including panic attacks, difficulty sleeping, and feeling overwhelmed by stress. She described moments where she felt stuck and afraid of the unknown, particularly around her decision to stay in Madison at 17. Her reflections on her mental health and the impact of stress on her ability to work and live her life suggest she identifies with feeling nervous or anxious in various situations.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Emily's interview suggests she is more grounded in her daily life, focused on survival, and dealing with practical challenges like financial instability, work, and family relationships. While she reflects on her past and has moments of introspection, there is little indication of a strong emphasis on imagination or creative thinking in her current life. Her narrative is more about resilience, coping, and incremental progress rather than imaginative or creative pursuits."

She values connection and has expressed a desire to be more open and supportive of others. However, she also described feeling isolated at times and struggling with her own emotional challenges, which might make it harder for her to fully relate to others' happiness. Still, her overall narrative suggests she is capable of understanding and caring about others' successes.",
            "BES-A_2": "Emily has described her relationships as limited and often characterized by a lack of deep emotional connection. She mentions having only a few friends from high school and feeling distant from them, as well as not being very close to her coworkers. She also describes herself as someone who has carried her struggles alone, often not asking for help or being open about her feelings. This suggests she may not be very attuned to the emotional states of others, including her friends, making it harder for her to recognize when they are frightened.",
            "BES-A_3": "Emily demonstrates a strong ability to reflect on her own emotions and those of others, particularly her mother. She acknowledges her own struggles with anxiety and has expressed empathy for her mother's sacrifices and emotional state. She also shows an understanding of others' experiences, such as her friends and community members. This suggests she has a good capacity for emotional understanding and empathy.",
            "BES-A_4": "Emily has described her own struggles with emotional awareness and connection, particularly in her relationship with her mother and her own anxiety. She has acknowledged feeling isolated and has admitted to being afraid to ask for help or be vulnerable. While she has started to open up and engage with others at the community center, she still seems to struggle with deeply understanding or responding to others' emotional states, including her own. This suggests she may not be highly attuned to her friends' fears.",
            "BES-A_5": "Emily shows moments of emotional awareness, such as reflecting on her mother's struggles and her own feelings of fear and regret. However, she also describes feeling isolated, not always being open with others, and sometimes struggling to ask for help. While she has moments of insight into her own and others' emotions, she doesn't consistently demonstrate the ability to intuitively understand others' feelings without them being expressed.",
            "BES-A_6": "Emily has described feeling emotionally isolated at times, struggling with anxiety, and having difficulty maintaining close relationships. She also mentioned that she has been learning to be more open and aware of others, but there are still moments where she feels disconnected or overwhelmed. This suggests she may not always be able to accurately interpret or respond to others' cheerful emotions, especially in stressful or emotionally complex situations.",
            "BES-A_7": "Emily has described her relationships as somewhat distant, with limited emotional intimacy, particularly with her mother. She also mentioned feeling isolated and struggling to maintain close friendships. While she has started to engage more with others at the community center, she has not shown a strong ability to interpret or respond to others' emotions in detail. Her introspective nature and focus on her own struggles suggest she may not be particularly skilled at reading others' emotional states quickly.",
            "BES-A_8": "Emily mentions having a few friends from high school and a few people she interacts with at the community center, but she also reflects on not being the best at maintaining relationships. She feels bad about not staying connected with friends like Sarah and admits to being focused on her own struggles. This suggests she may not be very aware of her friends' feelings, as she seems more self-focused and less attuned to others' emotional states.",
            "BES-A_9": "Emily has mentioned having a small social circle and difficulty maintaining close relationships. She has described feeling isolated and not being great at maintaining connections, which suggests she may not be very attuned to her friends' emotions.

She also mentions that she has not pursued higher education or training, which may indicate a lack of confidence in her ability to handle complex problems or plan for the future. Her narrative suggests a general sense of being stuck and not in control of her circumstances, which aligns with a belief that she is not good at solving complicated problems.",

She often reflects on decisions she made in the past with regret and acknowledges that she has been afraid to take risks or ask for help. While she has started to take small steps toward growth, such as attending classes and volunteering, she has not shown a strong inclination toward logical analysis or problem-solving as a core strength. Her narrative suggests she may not feel confident in her ability to solve complex problems logically, especially in high-stress or uncertain situations.",
            "REI_3": "Emily's interview suggests she tends to reflect on her life through emotional and personal narratives, often focusing on relationships, feelings, and small steps rather than structured or analytical reasoning. She discusses her decisions in terms of emotions, fears, and personal growth, rather than breaking down problems into logical components. This aligns more with someone who identifies as not being an analytical thinker.",
            "REI_4": "Emily reflects on her past decisions, such as choosing to stay in Madison at 17, and acknowledges that her choices were influenced by fear and a lack of support. She also shows awareness of her own behavior, such as not asking for help when needed, and is now working to be more open and reflective. While she admits to struggling with anxiety and feeling stuck, she also shows a capacity for self-reflection and growth. This suggests she is not entirely dismissive of careful reasoning but may not always prioritize it in her decision-making.",
            "REI_5": "Emily has described experiencing anxiety, difficulty making decisions, and feeling stuck or overwhelmed in her life. She has mentioned struggling with financial stress, work instability, and emotional challenges, all of which can contribute to difficulty reasoning under pressure.

While she does show some level of self-awareness and planning (e.g., taking online classes, managing her time, and tracking expenses), her narrative emphasizes emotional and relational aspects over analytical or logical reasoning. She does not demonstrate a strong focus on structured problem-solving or abstract thinking, which suggests she may not identify as having a highly logical mind.",
            "REI_8": "Emily often reflects on her decisions, such as the one at 17 when she chose to stay in Madison. She also mentions thinking through her current situation, like evaluating her work, financial stability, and future goals. However, she also expresses feeling stuck, overwhelmed, and struggling with consistency in her life, which may make careful thinking feel difficult or impractical for her at times.",
            "REI_9": "Emily often reflects on her decisions with a sense of regret and acknowledges that fear and lack of support influenced her choices, such as staying in Madison instead of moving with her cousin. She also describes her life as being shaped by incremental progress and self-compassion, rather than systematic or logical planning. This suggests she may not rely heavily on logic to solve her problems, but rather on emotional awareness and small steps.",
            "REI_10": "Emily often reflects on her decisions, especially those from her past, and acknowledges that some were made out of fear or lack of support. She also shows a pattern of self-reflection and trying to understand her motivations, such as her decision to stay in Madison at 17. However, she also admits to making choices based on emotions and uncertainty, which suggests she may not always have clear, explainable reasons for her decisions."

She has mentioned difficulty in maintaining close relationships and has expressed feelings of being stuck or overwhelmed. While she has made efforts to connect with others, such as through the community center, her emotional awareness seems limited, and she has not demonstrated a strong ability to read others' emotions, particularly in the context of her relationships with her mother and friends.",
            "BES-A_8": "Emily mentions having a few friends from high school and a few people she interacts with at the community center, but she also expresses feelings of isolation and difficulty maintaining close relationships. She reflects on how she hasn't been the best at staying connected with people like her friend Sarah or her former coworker Jake. She also notes that she feels like she's been holding back emotionally and hasn't been fully present in her relationships. This suggests she may not be very aware of her friends' feelings, aligning more with a lower score.",
            "BES-A_9": "Emily mentions having a few friends from high school and a few people she interacts with at the community center, but she also reflects on feeling isolated and not being great at maintaining relationships. She does not explicitly discuss her ability to read her friends' emotions, but her general sense of emotional distance and difficulty in forming close connections suggests she may not be very attuned to others' emotional states."

            "REI_1": "Emily has described her life as one of struggle, limited resources, and a lack of support. She has mentioned feeling stuck, not always knowing how to move forward, and relying on small steps rather than large, complex decisions. She has also expressed uncertainty about her future and has not shown a strong sense of confidence in solving complicated problems on her own.",
            "REI_2": "Emily has described her life as one of struggle, uncertainty, and limited opportunities. She has not pursued higher education, works part-time with inconsistent hours, and has not engaged in tasks that require complex logical analysis. She has also expressed feeling stuck, not always confident in her decisions, and relying on small steps and support from others. These factors suggest she may not feel strong in logical problem-solving.",
            "REI_3": "Emily's interview suggests she is more reflective, emotional, and introspective, often focusing on personal relationships, feelings, and small steps toward growth. She does not describe herself as someone who relies heavily on logic or structured analysis. Instead, she emphasizes emotional coping strategies, personal connections, and gradual progress, which aligns more with a non-analytical thinking style.",
            "REI_4": "Emily reflects on her life with a great deal of introspection, considering her past decisions, her emotional state, and her future goals. She acknowledges her fears, regrets, and areas for growth, which suggests she does engage in careful reasoning about her life and decisions. While she may not always act on her insights immediately, her ability to reflect and analyze her experiences indicates that she does have the capacity for careful reasoning.",
            "REI_5": "Emily has described experiencing anxiety, particularly during times of financial instability or when facing difficult decisions. She has also mentioned struggling with feelings of being stuck, overwhelmed, and uncertain about her future. These emotional and psychological challenges suggest that she may not reason well under pressure, especially when her mental health is affected by stress.",
            "REI_6": "Emily often reflects on her decisions with a sense of uncertainty and acknowledges that she has made choices based on fear, emotional connections, and limited support rather than logical analysis. She describes moments of hesitation, second-guessing, and learning through small steps rather than structured reasoning. While she is thoughtful and introspective, her narrative suggests she leans more on emotional and relational factors than purely logical ones when making decisions.",
            "REI_7": "Emily describes herself as someone who has struggled with anxiety, made decisions based on fear and emotional factors (like staying with her mom instead of moving for opportunity), and has relied on small, incremental steps rather than large, calculated plans. She also reflects on her life with a lot of emotional insight and self-awareness, but there is little indication of a strong emphasis on logical or analytical thinking in her decision-making process.",
            "REI_8": "Emily often reflects on her past decisions, such as staying in Madison at 17, and acknowledges that she made choices out of fear rather than careful consideration. She also describes feeling stuck and struggling with the unpredictability of her life, which suggests she may not feel confident in her ability to think things through carefully. However, she is beginning to engage in reflective practices, like journaling and attending community workshops, which indicates some growth in her ability to process and plan.",
            "REI_9": "Emily often reflects on her decisions with a sense of regret and uncertainty, particularly around major life choices like staying in Madison at 17. She acknowledges making decisions based on fear and emotional factors rather than logic. She also expresses a lack of confidence in her ability to plan or make long-term decisions, which suggests she may not rely heavily on logic to solve problems in her life.",
            "REI_10": "Emily reflects on her decisions with a sense of self-awareness and often acknowledges the emotional and situational factors that influenced her choices, such as fear, duty, and lack of support. She often describes her decisions as being shaped by external pressures or internal conflicts rather than clear, deliberate reasoning. This suggests she may not consistently have clear, explainable reasons for her decisions."
