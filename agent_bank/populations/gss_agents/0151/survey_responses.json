            "BFI-10_1": "Emily Johnson describes herself as someone who has struggled with asking for help, has been hesitant to open up to her mother, and has generally taken a quiet, introspective approach to life. She reflects on her past decisions with a sense of regret and self-awareness but doesn't often express her emotions outwardly. She also mentions not being the type to use social media for support and prefers face-to-face connections, which suggests a more reserved nature.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Emily has shared experiences of feeling isolated, having made decisions based on fear, and not asking for help even when needed. She has also described her relationships as limited, with a sense of distance from her father and a cautious, sometimes strained relationship with her mother. While she has started to open up and engage with others at the community center, her overall narrative suggests a general wariness or hesitation in trusting others fully, especially given her history of feeling stuck and unsupported.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Emily describes herself as someone who has struggled with financial instability, anxiety, and making decisions that could improve her life. However, she also shows a strong sense of self-awareness and a desire to grow, take small steps, and improve her situation. She is actively engaging with community resources, taking online classes, and reflecting on her past decisions. This indicates she sees herself as someone who is trying to be proactive and improve, rather than lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Emily has described experiencing anxiety, panic attacks, and struggles with stress, particularly during times of financial instability or uncertainty. She has also mentioned feeling overwhelmed and having difficulty coping at times, though she is working on improving her emotional coping strategies. While she is making progress, she has not yet reached a point where she consistently feels relaxed or handles stress well.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Emily does not mention any artistic interests or activities in her interview. She focuses on her struggles with employment, family, and daily survival. There is no indication that she engages in creative or artistic pursuits, nor does she express any interest in them. Her life seems centered around practical concerns rather than artistic expression.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Emily Johnson describes herself as having a small social circle and not being very active on social media. She mentions having a few friends from high school and a few people at the community center, but she also expresses feelings of isolation and a lack of close relationships. She often reflects on how she has been holding back and not being open with her mom or others. These descriptions suggest she is more reserved and not highly sociable.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Emily reflects on her life with a sense of self-awareness and empathy, particularly in her interactions with her mother, friends, and community. She acknowledges her own fears, shortcomings, and the impact of her decisions, but she does not express a tendency to criticize or find fault with others. Instead, she shows a willingness to grow, apologize, and seek support. She also values the people in her life and seems to focus on her own journey rather than judging others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Emily often describes her life as being on a tight budget, struggling with job stability, and feeling like she is just getting by. She has mentioned not always having the time or resources to focus on details, and she often reflects on how she has been holding back or not taking full advantage of opportunities. This suggests she may not see herself as someone who consistently does a thorough job, especially given the challenges she has faced in her life.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Emily has described experiencing anxiety and panic attacks, particularly during times of stress such as being laid off. She also mentioned struggling with fear and uncertainty in her past decisions, such as staying in Madison instead of moving with her cousin. These experiences suggest she is prone to feeling nervous or anxious in challenging situations, aligning her more with the higher end of the range.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Emily Johnson reflects on her life with a lot of introspection and emotional depth, but she does not express a strong inclination toward creative or imaginative thinking. Her narrative is more grounded in her experiences, struggles, and practical concerns. She does not mention engaging in creative activities or imagining alternate paths beyond her current reality in a way that would suggest an active imagination."

She expresses understanding of her mother's struggles and acknowledges the importance of support from others. She also shows empathy toward her past self and the choices she made, suggesting she is capable of understanding and relating to others' emotions.",
            "BES-A_2": "Emily Johnson has described her relationships as somewhat distant and has mentioned that she feels isolated at times. She has also reflected on her difficulty in maintaining close connections and being open with others. While she values the people in her life, she has acknowledged feeling disconnected from her mom and others, which suggests she may have difficulty reading emotional cues in others, including fear.",
            "BES-A_3": "Emily has shown a strong ability to reflect on her own emotions and the emotions of others, particularly in her relationship with her mother and the people she interacts with at the community center. She acknowledges her own struggles with anxiety and mental health, and she has also expressed understanding of her mother's sacrifices and challenges. This suggests she is emotionally aware and capable of empathizing with others' feelings.",
            "BES-A_4": "Emily has shown in the interview that she is emotionally aware and reflective, especially when it comes to her own fears and struggles. She also values connection and has expressed a desire to be more open and supportive of others, including her mom and friends. While she has struggled with anxiety and fear herself, she has also taken steps to care for her mental health and has started to engage more with others at the community center. This suggests she is capable of recognizing and responding to others' emotional states, even if she hasn't always done so in the past.",
            "BES-A_5": "Emily Johnson demonstrates a strong awareness of her own emotions and the emotions of others, especially in her reflections on her mother, her past decisions, and her interactions with people at the community center. She often acknowledges the feelings of others, such as her mother's struggles and the emotional impact of her own decisions. However, she also reflects on her own limitations in connecting with others and being open, which suggests she may not always be able to intuitively understand others’ emotions without them expressing them first.",
            "BES-A_6": "Emily Johnson describes herself as someone who has struggled with emotional awareness and social connection, particularly in her early life. She mentions feeling isolated, not always understanding her own emotions, and having difficulty maintaining close relationships. While she has made progress in connecting with others at the community center, she still seems to have moments of emotional distance and introspection. This suggests she may not be highly attuned to recognizing when others are cheerful, though she is not entirely disconnected from social cues.",
            "BES-A_7": "Emily Johnson describes her life as one marked by emotional struggles, including anxiety and a tendency to feel isolated. She also mentions difficulty with emotional openness, both with her mother and in her relationships. She does not appear to be particularly attuned to the emotional states of others, as she often feels disconnected and has not emphasized emotional awareness in her interactions with friends or family. Her emotional awareness seems limited, which aligns more with a lower score on this question.",
            "BES-A_8": "Emily mentions having a few friends from high school and a few people she interacts with at the community center, but she also reflects on not being great at maintaining relationships. She feels she has let people down and expresses a desire to be more open and connected. However, she also notes that she doesn’t always prioritize these connections, which suggests she may not be highly aware of her friends’ feelings.",
            "BES-A_9": "Emily has described having a limited social circle and feeling somewhat isolated, with only a few friends from high school and a few people at the community center. She also mentions feeling like she's been holding back from others and not being as open as she would like. This suggests she may not be very attuned to the emotional states of her friends, making it difficult for her to recognize when they are happy."

She has mentioned feeling stuck, not having clear direction, and making decisions based on fear or lack of support. These factors suggest she may feel less confident in her ability to solve complicated problems, especially given her limited resources and opportunities.",
            "REI_2": "Emily has described her life as one of struggle, limited resources, and emotional challenges. She has not mentioned any specific skills or experiences related to logical analysis or problem-solving, and her narrative suggests she often feels stuck or uncertain about her future. She has also mentioned anxiety and a lack of support, which may contribute to her feeling less confident in her ability to solve complex problems logically.",
            "REI_3": "Emily's interview suggests she tends to reflect on her life in emotional and narrative ways, often focusing on personal experiences, relationships, and feelings rather than logical or analytical frameworks. She discusses her struggles with anxiety, her decisions based on fear and emotional connections, and her reflections on her past in a deeply personal and introspective manner. There is little indication that she approaches her life or decisions through a highly analytical lens.",
            "REI_4": "Emily reflects on her life with a lot of introspection, showing that she is capable of thoughtful reasoning. She acknowledges her past decisions, evaluates her current situation, and contemplates her future with a sense of intentionality. While she admits to past fears and hesitation, she also demonstrates a growing ability to reflect on her actions and consider how to move forward. This suggests she does have some capacity for careful reasoning, even if she occasionally struggles with it.",
            "REI_5": "Emily has described experiencing anxiety, especially during times of uncertainty or when facing challenges like being laid off or struggling financially. She also mentioned having panic attacks and feeling overwhelmed at times, which suggests she may not reason well under pressure. Her reflections on her own struggles with fear and stress support the idea that she might find it difficult to think clearly when under pressure.",
            "REI_6": "Emily often reflects on her life with emotional insight and introspection, but she doesn't demonstrate a strong tendency to analyze situations in a highly logical or systematic way. She tends to focus on personal relationships, emotional well-being, and small steps toward progress rather than abstract or analytical reasoning. Her responses suggest she values emotional connection and personal growth over logical problem-solving as a primary strength.",
            "REI_7": "Emily's interview suggests she reflects deeply on her life, decisions, and emotions, often acknowledging her fears, limitations, and the impact of her environment. While she shows some introspection and self-awareness, there is no clear emphasis on systematic, logical thinking or problem-solving. Her responses are more emotional and narrative-driven, indicating a stronger reliance on intuition and personal experience than structured logic.",
            "REI_8": "Emily reflects on her life with a lot of introspection, often revisiting past decisions and considering how they shaped her current situation. She acknowledges moments of fear, hesitation, and regret, and she actively tries to understand her choices and their consequences. This suggests she is capable of and does engage in careful thinking, even if she sometimes feels stuck or uncertain. Her willingness to reflect and analyze her life indicates a tendency to think things through carefully.",
            "REI_9": "Emily reflects on her life with a lot of emotional insight and acknowledges her struggles with anxiety, fear, and decision-making. She often attributes her past choices to emotional factors like fear and lack of support, rather than logical reasoning. She also expresses uncertainty about her future and feels stuck in cycles, which suggests she may not consistently rely on logic to solve problems.",
            "REI_10": "Emily reflects frequently on her past decisions, often acknowledging that they were influenced by fear, lack of support, or uncertainty. She also shows a tendency to look back and analyze her choices, which suggests she is capable of reflecting on her reasoning. However, she also admits to making decisions out of fear or without clear direction, especially in her younger years. This suggests she may not always feel she has clear, explainable reasons for her decisions, especially in the past."

She has mentioned feeling isolated, not being very open with her mom, and avoiding deeper emotional conversations. She also mentions not being very active on social media and preferring face-to-face interactions over online ones. These behaviors and reflections suggest she may be more reserved in her self-perception.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Emily has shared a life marked by financial instability, personal struggles, and limited support systems. She has expressed feelings of being isolated, having made decisions out of fear, and not having asked for help even when needed. These experiences may have contributed to a cautious or guarded view of others, suggesting a lower level of general trust.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Emily has described her life as one of struggle, where she has faced financial hardship, limited educational opportunities, and emotional challenges. However, she has also shown a willingness to take small steps toward improvement, such as attending community classes, volunteering, and reflecting on her life. While she has faced obstacles, she does not appear to be lazy — rather, she is actively trying to improve her situation despite limited resources and support. She is aware of her challenges but is working to overcome them.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Emily has described experiencing anxiety, panic attacks, and struggling with stress, particularly after being laid off and during times of financial uncertainty. She has also mentioned that she is learning to manage her stress better through small steps like walking, journaling, and reaching out to others. However, she still feels overwhelmed at times and has not fully developed a consistent strategy for handling stress. This suggests she would not score a 5, but she is also not completely overwhelmed or unable to manage stress, so a 1 is too extreme. A score of 2 or 3 seems more accurate, but based on her recent efforts to manage stress, a 3 feels more aligned with her current state.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Emily's interview does not mention any engagement with artistic activities or interests. She describes her life as focused on survival, work, and basic needs, with little mention of hobbies, creative pursuits, or anything that suggests a strong interest in the arts. Her narrative centers around practical concerns, family, and community, but not artistic expression.",

She mentions feeling disconnected from others and not being great at maintaining relationships. She also admits to not being very active on social media and preferring face-to-face interactions over online ones. These details suggest she is more reserved and not highly sociable.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Emily Johnson's interview reveals a person who reflects on her own shortcomings and struggles with fear, anxiety, and self-doubt. She shows empathy toward her mother, acknowledges her own limitations, and expresses a desire to be more open and supportive. She does not demonstrate a tendency to find fault in others, but rather a tendency to be self-critical and to recognize her own fears and challenges. She seems to be more focused on her own growth and understanding of others rather than pointing out their faults.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Emily has described her life as one of struggle, inconsistency, and limited resources. She often mentions feeling stuck, not having enough support, and working part-time jobs with unpredictable hours. She also acknowledges that she hasn't always taken the best steps to improve her situation, such as not pursuing higher education or not being more proactive in seeking help. This suggests she may not see herself as someone who consistently does a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Emily has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, including panic attacks and feelings of being overwhelmed by stress. She has described moments where she felt stuck, worried about her future, and even called her mom in a moment of panic. These experiences align with a higher level of nervousness and anxiety, suggesting she would rate herself closer to the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Emily reflects on her life with a focus on her struggles, relationships, and small steps forward. While she does engage in introspection and has moments of reflection on what could have been, there is no explicit mention of her engaging in creative or imaginative thinking beyond her personal experiences and future hopes. Her narrative is more grounded in her reality, her past decisions, and her practical efforts to improve her life, rather than a vivid or expansive imagination."

She also expresses a desire to be more present for others and to build connections. However, she also acknowledges her own emotional struggles and the difficulty of asking for help, which might make it harder for her to fully understand others' feelings in a deeply empathetic way. She seems to have a moderate level of emotional awareness and connection, which would place her in the middle range.",

She mentions feeling isolated and not always being open with her mom or others. She also reflects on how she has been holding back and not fully engaging with people in her life.

She also shows empathy toward others in her life, such as her friends and community members. However, she does not explicitly mention being able to sense others' emotions before they are expressed.

            "REI_8": "Emily Johnson reflects on her life with a great deal of introspection and often considers her choices and their consequences. She discusses her past decisions, such as staying in Madison instead of moving with her cousin, and how she feels about them now. She also shows a willingness to reflect on her current situation, including her work, relationships, and future goals. This suggests that she is capable of and comfortable with careful thinking.",
            "REI_9": "Emily often reflects on her decisions with a sense of regret and acknowledges that fear and emotional barriers have influenced her choices. She has described moments where she felt stuck and made decisions based on fear rather than logic. While she is beginning to take small steps toward change, she does not demonstrate a strong reliance on logical reasoning as a primary tool for problem-solving in her life.",
            "REI_10": "Emily reflects on her decisions with a sense of introspection and acknowledges that some of her choices were driven by fear, lack of support, or uncertainty. She often describes making decisions based on emotional or situational factors, such as staying with her mom out of fear of abandonment or not seeking help due to pride. While she is becoming more reflective and aware of her choices, she still seems to view many of her decisions as being shaped by external pressures or emotional responses rather than clear, deliberate reasoning."

            "BFI-10_1": "Emily Johnson describes herself as someone who has often carried her struggles alone, avoided asking for help, and has been hesitant to open up about her feelings or past decisions. She also mentions not being very active on social media and preferring face-to-face interactions over online ones, which suggests she may be more introverted or reserved in her self-perception.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Emily has shared a life marked by personal struggles, financial instability, and emotional challenges. She has expressed feelings of being isolated, having made decisions based on fear, and having difficulty asking for help. These experiences may have made her more cautious and less trusting of others. However, she also shows a willingness to connect with others, such as her mom, friends, and community center members, which suggests some level of trust. Still, her overall narrative leans toward a sense of being on her own and having to navigate life without much support, which aligns more with a lower score on trust.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Emily has described her life as one of struggle, where she has worked part-time jobs, taken online classes, and made efforts to improve her situation. She has also reflected on her past decisions and is actively trying to make changes in her life. These behaviors suggest she does not see herself as lazy but rather as someone who is working through challenges and trying to move forward.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Emily has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, panic attacks, and difficulty managing stress, especially after being laid off and during periods of financial instability. She has described feeling overwhelmed, having trouble sleeping, and even calling in sick due to stress. While she has started to take steps to manage her stress, such as going for walks and attending support groups, she still acknowledges that stress significantly impacts her daily life and emotional state.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Emily does not mention any artistic interests or activities in her interview. She focuses on her struggles with employment, family, and daily survival, and there is no indication that she engages with creative or artistic pursuits. Her life seems to be centered around practical matters rather than artistic expression.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Emily describes her social life as limited, with only a few close friends and a small circle of people she interacts with regularly. She mentions feeling isolated at times and not being great at maintaining relationships. She also notes that she prefers face-to-face connections over social media, which suggests she is not overly sociable or outgoing. While she does have some social interactions, they are not frequent or expansive, which aligns more with a lower score on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Emily's interview reveals a person who reflects on her own shortcomings and struggles, showing a tendency to be self-aware and introspective. She often acknowledges her fears, limitations, and the ways she has let others down, but she does not express judgment or criticism toward others. Instead, she shows empathy and understanding, especially toward her mother and others in her life. She is more focused on her own growth and the challenges she has faced, rather than finding fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Emily often describes her life as one of struggle, survival, and making do with what she has. She works part-time at a café and does odd jobs, but she doesn’t describe her work as something she takes pride in or feels is thorough. She also mentions that she has not pursued further education or training and has taken a more passive approach to her future. This suggests she may not see herself as someone who does a thorough job, especially in a professional or structured sense.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Emily has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, including panic attacks, difficulty sleeping, and feeling overwhelmed by life's challenges. She has described moments where she felt stuck and fearful, such as when she was 17 and decided not to leave her mom, or after being laid off. These experiences suggest that she does get nervous easily and has a history of anxiety that affects her daily life.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Emily's life story reflects a focus on practicality and survival rather than imagination or creativity. She describes her life in terms of daily struggles, financial constraints, and routine work. While she reflects on her past and contemplates her future, her narrative does not suggest a strong engagement with imagination or creative thinking. Her thoughts are more grounded in reality and survival."

            "BES-A_1": "Emily Johnson demonstrates empathy in her interactions, particularly with her mother and others in her life. She reflects on her mother's sacrifices, acknowledges the struggles of others in her neighborhood, and expresses a desire to connect with people at the community center. She also shows understanding of her own emotional struggles and the importance of support systems, suggesting she is capable of empathizing with others' happiness.",
            "BES-A_2": "Emily has described her relationships as limited and often feels isolated, with only a few people she considers important in her life. She mentions feeling like she's been carrying things on her own and not always being open or connected with others. She also reflects on her difficulty in maintaining close relationships, such as with her mom and friends, which suggests she may not be very attuned to others' emotional states.",
            "BES-A_3": "Emily has shared a great deal about her own emotional struggles, including anxiety, feelings of being stuck, and moments of isolation. She has also reflected on her relationship with her mother, acknowledging her own fears and the emotional distance that has developed. While she has expressed empathy for others in her life (e.g., her mom, friends, and community members), she has not explicitly demonstrated a strong ability to understand others' feelings in a general sense. Her responses suggest a moderate level of empathy, but not necessarily a high one.",
            "BES-A_4": "Emily Johnson has described her own struggles with anxiety and emotional challenges, and she has reflected on how she has avoided asking for help or being open with others, including her mother. While she has started to become more open and involved with others at the community center, she also mentions that she feels like she has been holding back and not being fully present for others. This suggests that she may not always be able to recognize or respond to her friends' fear in a supportive way, especially given her own emotional struggles.",
            "BES-A_5": "Emily Johnson demonstrates a strong awareness of her own emotions and the emotions of others, particularly in her reflections on her relationship with her mother and the people in her life. She often talks about feeling others' struggles, such as her mother's sacrifices and the shared experiences of her neighborhood. However, she also acknowledges her own limitations in emotional awareness, such as not always being open or present with her mother. While she is reflective and attuned to the emotions of others, she doesn’t consistently demonstrate the intuitive ability to understand others’ feelings without them being expressed.",
            "BES-A_6": "Emily has described feeling emotionally isolated and struggling with anxiety, which may make it harder for her to interpret others' emotions accurately. She also mentions not being very involved in social media or close relationships, which may limit her practice in reading others' moods. However, she has shown some growth in becoming more open and connected with people at the community center, suggesting some level of emotional awareness.",
            "BES-A_7": "Emily has described feeling emotionally isolated, struggling with anxiety, and having difficulty maintaining close relationships. She also mentioned feeling like she has been carrying her emotions on her own and not being very open with others, including her mother. These patterns suggest she may not be very attuned to others' emotional states, including anger in friends.",
            "BES-A_8": "Emily mentions having a few friends from high school and a few people she interacts with at the community center, but she also reflects on not being the best at maintaining relationships. She expresses a sense of loneliness and a desire for more meaningful connections, which suggests she is somewhat aware of her friends' feelings but may not always act on that awareness. However, she does not explicitly demonstrate a high level of emotional attunement to others, nor does she show a lack of awareness. She is more focused on her own struggles and growth.",
            "BES-A_9": "Emily has mentioned that she has a small social circle and that she feels somewhat isolated, with limited close relationships. She has also reflected on feeling disconnected from others, including her mother, and has described herself as someone who prefers face-to-face connections over social media. This suggests she may not be very attuned to the emotional states of her friends, especially if she doesn't interact with them frequently or deeply."

She also mentioned that she didn't go to college and has had inconsistent work and limited opportunities for growth. These factors suggest she may not feel confident in her ability to solve complex problems, especially when she has faced challenges without much guidance or support.",
            "REI_2": "Emily has described feeling stuck in cycles, struggling with financial planning, and making decisions based on fear or lack of support. She has also mentioned difficulty in seeing a clear path forward, which suggests she may not feel confident in her ability to logically analyze complex problems. However, she has shown some initiative in taking small steps and learning new skills, which may indicate some level of problem-solving ability.",
            "REI_3": "Emily's interview suggests she is more reflective, emotional, and introspective, often focusing on personal experiences, relationships, and emotional well-being. She does not show a strong inclination toward structured problem-solving or analytical thinking, instead leaning on intuition, personal connections, and small, incremental steps for progress. This aligns more with the lower end of the range.",
            "REI_4": "Emily Johnson reflects on her life with a great deal of introspection and self-awareness. She often pauses to think about her decisions, the impact of her choices, and how her past has shaped her present. She also considers the future and evaluates small steps she can take to improve her life. This suggests she does engage in careful reasoning, even if she acknowledges her struggles and limitations.",
            "REI_5": "Emily has described experiencing anxiety and panic attacks, particularly during times of instability like being laid off. She also mentioned struggling with stress and feeling overwhelmed at times, which suggests she may not reason well under pressure. Her reflections on her mental health and emotional coping strategies indicate that she is aware of her challenges in handling stress, which aligns with a higher score on this statement.",
            "REI_6": "Emily reflects on her life with a lot of introspection and emotional awareness, but she doesn't demonstrate a strong focus on logical problem-solving or systematic thinking. She often describes her decisions as being influenced by fear, emotional connections, and small steps rather than a clear, logical plan. Her narrative suggests she relies more on intuition and emotional insight than on structured, logical reasoning.",
            "REI_7": "Emily's interview reflects a more introspective, emotional, and reflective approach to life. She often discusses her feelings, fears, and relationships in depth, and she frames many of her decisions as being influenced by emotions, past experiences, and the need for support. While she shows some ability to reflect on her life and make small, intentional steps, she does not emphasize logical reasoning or systematic problem-solving as a primary trait. Her narrative is more about emotional growth, connection, and survival rather than structured analysis.",
            "REI_8": "Emily Johnson describes moments in her life where she made decisions based on fear and lack of support, such as choosing to stay in Madison at 17 instead of moving with her cousin. She also reflects on her struggles with anxiety and how it affected her ability to focus and make decisions. While she has started to take small steps toward self-improvement, such as attending classes and seeking support, she still describes feeling stuck and overwhelmed by the challenges in her life. This suggests she may not always feel comfortable or capable of thinking through things carefully, especially in high-stress situations.",
            "REI_9": "Emily reflects on her life with a lot of emotional insight and acknowledges the impact of her past decisions, but she doesn't emphasize logical reasoning as a primary tool for problem-solving. Instead, she focuses on personal growth, emotional healing, and small steps forward. Her approach seems more intuitive and reflective than strictly logical.",
            "REI_10": "Emily reflects on her decisions with a lot of introspection, especially regarding her past choices, such as staying in Madison instead of moving with her cousin. She often questions her decisions and acknowledges the emotional and situational factors that influenced them. However, she also shows a tendency to look back and analyze her choices, which suggests she can explain them, even if they were not always clear at the time. This indicates she is somewhere in the middle of the range, but leaning slightly toward having explainable reasons for her decisions."
