While some horror movies can be genuinely terrifying, most are crafted to entertain rather than to cause extreme fear. I have seen horror movies that were frightening, but none that left me 'scared to death.' On the other hand, I have also seen horror movies that were unoriginal or poorly made, which could be described as 'bored to death.' Overall, I would place horror movies closer to the middle of the spectrum, as they are typically meant to be engaging and thrilling rather than either extremely terrifying or completely uninteresting."

However, I also see it as a way to acknowledge the complexity of systems and how small causes can lead to large, seemingly random effects.

They existed long before human civilization and were eventually wiped out by a random event (an asteroid impact). This aligns more with the idea that history is random rather than a linear progression of improvement. While some might argue that the evolution of life from dinosaurs to humans is a form of progress, the extinction of dinosaurs itself was not a result of civilization or improvement, but rather a random and catastrophic event."

However, drinking in a way that is excessive or inappropriate, such as getting overly drunk in public or making a spectacle of oneself, would definitely fall on the cringe side.

While it may evoke some sense of adventure or curiosity (wanderlust), the mention of 'candle light' often carries a connotation of warmth, comfort, and familiarity—elements that are more closely associated with homesickness.

While there are objective elements—like symmetry or color harmony—what makes something beautiful often depends on personal emotions, cultural context, and individual values. My own experiences growing up in a multicultural environment have shown me that beauty can be deeply personal and varies across people and traditions. For example, the way my family celebrates Diwali or the way I find beauty in both traditional Indian art and modern tech design reflects this blend of objective and subjective elements. However, I lean more toward the subjective side because beauty is often tied to feelings and meaning, which are inherently personal."
