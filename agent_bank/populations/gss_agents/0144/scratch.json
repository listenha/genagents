  "agent_profile_summary": "Natalia Chen, a 35-year-old project manager in the tech industry, grew up in Mumbai before moving to Bellevue, Washington, at age five, where she has built a life rooted in both her Indian heritage and the opportunities of the Pacific Northwest. After completing her undergraduate studies in India, she made a pivotal decision to relocate to the U.S. for a graduate program, a choice that led her to meet her husband, David, and shaped her career in project management. A committed caregiver and community volunteer, she balances her demanding job with raising two bilingual children and supporting immigrant families through local outreach. Her life is defined by a continuous negotiation between professional ambition and family life, guided by the values of resilience, cultural pride, and the importance of community—traits she inherited from her parents and continues to pass on to her own children."
