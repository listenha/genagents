    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nNatalia Chen: I was born in Mumbai, India, but I moved to the United States with my family when I was just five years old. We settled in Bellevue, Washington, where I grew up in a close-knit neighborhood. My parents both valued education highly\u2014my father earned a graduate degree in engineering, and my mother has a bachelor's in economics. She worked as a financial analyst, and my father ran his own consulting business. We were never short on resources, and I always felt fortunate to have the opportunities that came with our family's financial stability. I remember learning English quickly, though I still speak Hindi at home with my parents. My childhood was filled with cultural traditions from India, like Diwali and Holi, which my parents made sure we celebrated even in our new home. I was always curious and driven, which led me to pursue a graduate degree in business administration. I met my husband, David, during my first year of graduate school\u2014he was a fellow student, and we've been married for over a decade now. We have two young children, and I currently work as a project manager for a tech company. Life has been a journey of balancing my roots with the new culture I've grown to love, and I consider myself very much a blend of both worlds.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nNatalia Chen: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped my path. After I finished my undergraduate degree in India, I had the option to either stay and pursue a master's there or move to the U.S. for a more specialized program. My parents were supportive of both choices, but I felt a strong pull toward the U.S. because of the opportunities in business and technology. I remember sitting with my mother one evening, telling her how much I wanted to be part of something bigger, something that felt more dynamic. She looked at me and said, 'If you're going to take this leap, make sure it's not just for the destination, but for the journey you'll grow through.' That stayed with me. I moved to the U.S., started my graduate program, and that's where I met David. It was a risk, but it was the right one. It taught me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of trusting my instincts\u2014even when the path wasn't clear.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nNatalia Chen: I think, in that moment, it was a conscious choice, but one that felt almost inevitable. I had been reading about the tech boom in the U.S. and the opportunities in business management there. I wanted to be part of that energy, to learn from people who were shaping the future. But I also knew it wasn't just about the career\u2014it was about growth, about stepping out of my comfort zone. I remember feeling a mix of excitement and fear, but I told myself that if I didn't take the chance, I might always wonder what could have been. So, I made the decision to move, and it wasn't just about the destination\u2014it was about the person I wanted to become along the way.\n\n",

When I was considering moving to the U.S., my mother was my biggest supporter, but I also had a mentor from my undergraduate program who encouraged me to take the leap. She had moved to the U.S. a few years earlier and had helped me connect with a few professors who were willing to take me on as a student. Without her guidance and the support of my parents, I might not have felt as confident in making that decision. It's amazing how one person's belief in you can make all the difference. I think that's why I always try to pay it forward\u2014by mentoring others who are considering similar steps in their lives.\n\n",

My husband, David, is a software engineer, and we met in graduate school, as I mentioned earlier. We've been married for over 12 years now, and our relationship has been built on mutual support and shared goals. We have a daughter, Priya, who is eight, and a son, Arjun, who is five. They are both bilingual, speaking both English and Hindi, which I think is a beautiful way to honor our heritage while being fully integrated into American culture. Raising them has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I try to instill in them the values my parents taught me\u2014hard work, respect for others, and the importance of education. At the same time, I want them to feel comfortable being who they are, whether that means embracing their Indian roots or exploring their own unique identities. It's a balancing act, but one I'm grateful for every day.\n\n",

The crossroads I faced after my undergraduate studies was a pivotal moment that defined my path, and it's fascinating to look back and see how that decision led me to meet my husband, build a family, and find my place in the tech industry. It's also a reminder of how important it is to support others as they navigate their own journeys, just as I was supported when I took that leap of faith.",

She's a few years younger than me and is currently working as a graphic designer in Bangalore. We stay in touch through video calls and messages, and I make it a point to visit them at least once a year. Our relationship is very close, even though we're separated by distance.

One person who comes to mind is Priya Patel, a close friend from graduate school. She's a marketing strategist now, and we've been through a lot together\u2014late-night study sessions, career transitions, and even the challenges of raising children in a multicultural environment. She's someone I can always count on for honest advice and support. Then there's my mentor, Dr. James Carter, who was my professor during my master's program. He saw potential in me that I didn't always see in myself, and his guidance helped me navigate the early stages of my career. Even now, I reach out to him for advice when I'm facing complex decisions at work. These relationships have been vital in shaping who I am today, and I'm grateful for the people who have stood by me through the ups and downs of life.\n\n",

It's a mix of single-family homes and townhouses, with a lot of young families like mine. The area is very walkable, with parks, coffee shops, and community centers that make it easy to connect with neighbors. I love that there's a strong sense of community here\u2014people know each other, and there are always events like cultural festivals or local fairs that bring everyone together. It's also close to the tech hubs in Redmond and Seattle, which is convenient for my job. Even though I've been here for over 20 years, I still find new things to love about this place.

I've never felt threatened or uncomfortable, even when walking alone at night. The local police department is responsive, and there are neighborhood watch programs that keep things peaceful.

That said, the cost of living here can be quite high, and I've had to make careful financial decisions to ensure we can continue living comfortably. There are also moments when I miss the slower pace of life back in India\u2014like the long evenings spent with family, the vibrant street food, and the way time feels more flexible.

I start my day early, usually around 6:30 a.m., with a quick workout or yoga session to get my energy going. By 7:30, I'm getting the kids ready for school\u2014Priya is in third grade, and Arjun is in kindergarten, so their routines are different. I drop them off, then head to the office, where I work as a project manager for a tech company. My days are usually filled with meetings, coordinating with cross-functional teams, and managing timelines for different projects. I try to take lunch breaks when I can, often grabbing a quick bite at one of the cafes near the office or eating at home if I'm running behind. In the afternoons, I pick up the kids and we have some family time\u2014sometimes we go to the park, other times we have homework or creative activities. On weekends, we like to explore the area\u2014whether it's visiting a museum, going to a local festival, or just having a relaxed day at home.

She has a full day of classes, and after school, she usually has a soccer practice or a coding club meeting at the community center.

It was tough because I felt like I was falling behind, but it also forced me to slow down and realize that I can't do everything at once.

I'm still navigating the balance between work, family, and self-care, but I'm learning that it's okay to not have everything figured out all the time.\n\n",

How about for you?\n\nNatalia Chen: I think I've experienced moments of anxiety, especially during times when work demands felt overwhelming or when I was trying to balance everything without feeling like I was failing at anything. There were periods when I felt like I was constantly running on empty, and I wasn't sure how to ask for help without feeling like a burden. But over time, I've come to understand that mental health is just as important as physical health, and it's okay to not be okay all the time.

I've also found that small acts of self-compassion\u2014like allowing myself to rest when I need to or not striving for perfection in every aspect of life\u2014have made a big difference.

We've had to have some difficult conversations with him about how to handle situations where he feels left out, and I've been trying to model empathy and resilience for him.

I was raised in a Hindu household, and my parents made sure that I understood the values and traditions of our faith. Practices like daily prayers, observing festivals such as Diwali and Holi, and the emphasis on compassion and duty have been deeply ingrained in me. Even now, I find solace in meditation and the rituals that connect me to my heritage. At the same time, I don't see my spirituality as rigid\u2014it's more about the principles that guide my life, like kindness, gratitude, and the importance of community. I believe that faith is a personal journey, and while I may not attend temple as often as I used to, I still find meaning in the quiet moments of reflection and the connections I have with my family and friends.

I have a Facebook account where I keep in touch with my parents, my sister, and some of my old friends from India. I also follow a few local community groups in Bellevue that post about cultural events, volunteer opportunities, and neighborhood updates. I don't use Instagram or Twitter as much, partly because I find them overwhelming with the constant stream of information, but also because I prefer more meaningful interactions over quick updates. I do, however, follow a few professional groups on LinkedIn related to project management and the tech industry, which have been helpful for staying informed about trends and networking with colleagues.

For example, when I was dealing with the back pain and the stress of work, I found comfort in connecting with a few online communities for working mothers. They shared their own struggles and advice, which helped me feel less alone. I also remember reaching out to my sister on Facebook when I was feeling overwhelmed with everything, and she sent me a heartfelt message that reminded me of how much I was loved and supported. That kind of connection, even through a screen, can be really powerful.

There were times when I felt like I was constantly on edge, worrying about deadlines, school projects, and even the small things like meal prep or getting everyone out the door on time. But I've been working on developing better coping strategies. One thing that has helped is setting aside time each evening to reflect on my day\u2014whether through journaling or just sitting quietly with a cup of tea. I've also started practicing deep breathing exercises when I feel overwhelmed, which has helped me stay centered. Another change has been learning to say 'no' more often to things that don't align with my priorities. I used to feel guilty about not being available for every event or request, but I've come to realize that taking time for myself is not selfish\u2014it's necessary. I've also leaned more on my support system, whether it's my husband, my parents, or even my friends. Talking things through with someone I trust has been a huge relief.

Our mortgage payment alone takes up about a third of our income, which is a significant chunk, especially with the rising costs in the area. Childcare is another major expense\u2014Priya and Arjun both attend after-school programs and extracurricular activities, which add up over time. I also pay for private tutoring for Priya in math and science, which is something I feel is important for her to stay ahead in school. Groceries are another regular expense, and while I try to cook at home as much as possible, there are weeks when we have to buy takeout or convenience foods when things get too busy. We also have a monthly budget for transportation, utilities, and personal expenses like clothing and healthcare. I've been trying to be more mindful of our spending, especially with the goal of saving for the kids' future education and any potential emergencies.

Typically, we aim to keep our expenses around $6,000 to $6,200. The increase this month was due to a few unexpected costs\u2014Priya's robotics team had a competition that required travel and materials, and we had to replace the HVAC system in our home after it started malfunctioning. While these things are necessary, they do put a strain on our budget. To manage, we've been making adjustments elsewhere, like eating out less and prioritizing essential purchases. I also try to set aside a small emergency fund each month, even if it's just a few hundred dollars, so we're not caught off guard by surprises like these.

The mortgage payments are a significant part of our budget, but owning a home gives us a sense of security and pride. I remember the day we closed on the house\u2014it felt like a milestone, not just financially, but emotionally. It was the first time we had a real place that felt like ours, where the kids could grow up and where we could build a life together.

Tell me all about how your bills have fluctuated over the past year.\n\nNatalia Chen: Over the past year, our bills have definitely fluctuated with the seasons and life events. For example, during the winter months, our heating costs went up significantly, especially after we had to replace the HVAC system last month. That was a big hit to our budget, but it was necessary to avoid further damage. In the summer, our electricity bills tend to rise because we use more air conditioning, and we also have higher water usage due to lawn maintenance. Holidays like Diwali and Christmas bring additional expenses\u2014like buying gifts for family back in India, decorating the house, and sometimes even traveling for a short visit. School-related costs also vary; when the kids start new academic years, we have to budget for supplies, uniforms, and sometimes even private tutoring. There are also unexpected expenses, like car maintenance or medical costs, which can throw our budget off track. To manage these fluctuations, I've been trying to track our spending more closely and set aside a little extra each month for emergencies.

It's a comfortable amount, but we're always mindful of how we allocate it, especially with the rising costs of living here. I've come to see our income not just as a number, but as a responsibility\u2014to ensure that we're providing for our children's needs, saving for their future, and also allowing ourselves the small luxuries that make life enjoyable. I remember when we first started out, we were living on much less, and it was a constant juggling act. Now, with more stability, I feel like we're in a better position to plan for the long term, but I'm also aware that financial security is something we have to work at every day. It's not about having everything, but about making sure we're making the most of what we have, and that we're teaching our kids the value of money and responsibility from an early age.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nNatalia Chen: I've been at my current job for about seven years now, and it's been a journey of growth and learning. The company offers a range of benefits that I truly appreciate, especially considering the demands of work and family life. We have comprehensive health insurance that covers both my family and me, which is a huge relief, especially with the ongoing need for regular check-ups and the occasional therapy sessions I've been attending. The company also provides generous paid time off\u2014four weeks of vacation, ten days of sick leave, and a few personal days. I've found that having this flexibility is essential, especially when the kids are sick or when I need to take a mental health day to recharge. One of the things I value most is the company's commitment to work-life balance. They encourage employees to take their vacation days and even have a policy that discourages after-hours communication unless it's absolutely necessary. It's not perfect, but it's a step in the right direction, and it's helped me feel more in control of my time. I also appreciate the professional development opportunities they offer, like access to online courses and conferences, which have been instrumental in keeping my skills sharp and my career moving forward.\n\n",

I have a good rapport with my manager, Sarah, who has been a strong advocate for me throughout my career. She's someone who not only trusts my judgment but also encourages me to take on leadership roles when needed. I admire her ability to balance strategic thinking with empathy, and I feel fortunate to have her guidance. As for my coworkers, I've built a strong network of colleagues who are not only skilled but also supportive. We often collaborate on complex projects, and I find that open communication and a shared sense of purpose make our work environment both productive and enjoyable. There are moments when we face challenges or disagreements, but I believe that honesty and a willingness to listen go a long way in resolving them.

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nNatalia Chen: My work schedule is generally predictable, but there's a fair amount of flexibility depending on the project and team needs. Most of my days follow a standard 9-to-5 structure, but I often find myself starting a bit earlier or staying late, especially when we're in the final stages of a project launch. The tech industry is fast-paced, and while I appreciate the structure of having core hours, I also value the ability to adjust my schedule when necessary. For example, if I need to pick up the kids from an after-school activity or attend a family event, I can usually rearrange my tasks or delegate them to my team. That flexibility has been especially important as a working mother, allowing me to balance my professional responsibilities with the needs of my family. At the same time, I've learned to set boundaries\u2014like turning off work notifications after hours\u2014to ensure I have time to recharge and be fully present for my children. It's a balance that takes effort, but one that I feel is essential for both my career and my personal life.\n\n",

We're not wealthy, but we're not struggling either. It's a balance of working hard, making smart choices, and being grateful for what we have. I think the biggest thing that gives me peace of mind is knowing that we've built a safety net\u2014both in terms of our savings and the stability of our jobs. I also appreciate that we're teaching our kids about financial responsibility from an early age, whether it's through budgeting for their allowances or talking about the value of hard work. That said, there are moments when I worry about the future, especially with the rising costs of education and healthcare. But I try to focus on what we can control and the progress we've made so far. I believe that as long as we continue to be intentional with our money and support each other, we'll be okay.\n\n",

I also realized how important it is to have a job that offers flexibility and benefits, especially when juggling so many responsibilities. My work as a project manager has given me the stability I need, but it also requires me to constantly adapt and find balance. I'm grateful for the support I have from my family and the structure my job provides, even when things get overwhelming.

Even though my father was often busy with his studies and projects, he always made time for our family, whether it was helping with homework or taking us on weekend trips.

He was very detail-oriented and had a reputation for delivering high-quality work on time. Even though his job was demanding, he always made it a point to be involved in our lives\u2014whether it was helping me with my science fair projects or taking my sister and me on weekend trips to explore new places. My mother, on the other hand, worked as a financial analyst for a multinational firm.

She was incredibly organized and had a knack for turning complex numbers into clear insights.

My mother worked for a financial consulting firm that provided services to both government agencies and private corporations. Her role involved analyzing financial data, preparing reports, and helping clients make informed decisions about budgeting and investment strategies. Both of them were deeply committed to their work, but they also made sure that family was always a priority.

I'd love to take on more leadership roles, maybe even lead a team of project managers or mentor others who are just starting out in the tech industry. I also hope to have more flexibility in my work schedule so that I can be more present for my children as they grow older. Priya is starting to show a real passion for robotics and coding, and I'd love to support her in pursuing that path, whether it's through college or other opportunities. Arjun is still finding his way, and I hope to continue being a source of encouragement and guidance for him as he navigates his own interests and challenges. On a personal level, I hope to continue prioritizing my health and well-being, whether that means taking more trips with my family, deepening my spiritual practice, or simply finding more moments of stillness in my day.
