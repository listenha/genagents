  "agent_profile_summary": "Lisa Johnson, a 42-year-old resident of Portland, Oregon, grew up in a working-class family where her parents instilled in her the values of education and community service. After earning a graduate degree in economics, she took a pivotal step by leaving her academic path to volunteer full-time with a non-profit focused on poverty alleviation, a decision that shaped her commitment to economic development and social justice. Today, she remains deeply involved in her community, balancing job searches with networking, volunteering, and maintaining close ties with her family and friends. While the uncertainty of unemployment and financial strain create ongoing tension, Lisa’s resilience shines through her routine of mindfulness, exercise, and strategic planning. Her life reflects a steady drive to align her career with her values, even as she navigates the challenges of building a stable future."
