            "BFI-10_1": "Based on Lisa's description, she has a history of being involved in student politics and activism, which suggests she is likely more outgoing and sociable. However, the interview also mentions that she has been putting in a lot of effort into her job search, which can be a solitary and introspective process. This indicates that she might also have moments of reserved behavior. Given her overall description and the context of the job search, it seems that she is more on the reserved side, but not entirely so.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on Lisa's interview, she seems to be someone who values community and connection, as evidenced by her strong relationships with her family and friends, and her involvement in community service. Her willingness to volunteer and connect with others in her field suggests that she is open and trusting of others. Additionally, her reflections on the importance of support systems and the value of community indicate a trusting nature.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Lisa's description of her current situation, particularly her focus on job searching and her commitment to making a positive impact in her community, it is unlikely that she sees herself as lazy. She has been actively involved in her job search and has described various activities and commitments that show her engagement and dedication.

However, she has also mentioned using coping strategies like exercise, mindfulness, and therapy to manage her stress. This suggests she is able to handle stress to some extent, but it is clearly a challenge for her. Given this balance, it seems more likely that she would rate herself a 3 or slightly lower, but leaning towards the middle of the scale to reflect her ability to handle stress with some effort.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on Lisa's responses, she describes herself as someone who is deeply involved in activism, community service, and professional pursuits. While she mentions participating in some community events and connecting with friends who share her values, there's no indication of her having a strong interest in traditional arts like painting or music. Her focus seems to be more on social and economic development. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that Lisa would lean towards the lower end of the scale, indicating fewer artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on Lisa's description, she has a strong network of family and friends, participates in various community events, and engages in activities like joining a book club and collaborating with friends.

She mentions that she has been putting in a lot of effort into her job search, tailoring her resume and cover letters, and networking.

Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that she would choose a higher number on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Lisa Johnson has described herself as dealing with anxiety and stress due to her job search, which can be a significant source of nervousness and worry. However, she also mentions that she has been implementing coping strategies like journaling and mindfulness practices, indicating that she is actively working to manage her nervousness. This suggests that while she experiences nervousness, she is not constantly overwhelmed by it. Therefore, a middle ground between 1 and 5 seems appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on Lisa's background and personality described in the interview, she seems to be someone who is thoughtful and engaged in meaningful causes, but there isn't much indication that she is highly imaginative or creative.

She mentions dealing with anxiety over rejections and the pressure of finding the right job. Given her acknowledgment of these feelings and the challenges she faces, it's reasonable to conclude that she would not rate herself as someone who never gets nervous. However, she also doesn't seem to be someone who experiences nervousness constantly or in every situation.

            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Lisa Johnson describes herself as someone who has faced challenges in her job search and deals with uncertainty and stress. While she mentions she's resilient and persistent, there's no indication that she considers herself particularly adept at logical analysis or problem-solving. Instead, she focuses on the emotional and social aspects of her life, such as her family, friends, and community involvement. Therefore, it's more likely that she would choose a lower number on this scale, reflecting her self-assessment of not being very good at logical problem-solving.",

She mentions experiencing anxiety and stress, indicating that she finds these situations challenging. However, she also describes herself as resilient and persistent, which suggests she is working on improving her ability to handle pressure. Given her current struggles and the effort she is putting into her job search, it's reasonable to assume she is not yet at the 5 level but is closer to the middle or slightly below.",
            "REI_6": "Based on Lisa's background and the nature of her job search, which involves tailoring resumes, networking, and participating in interviews, she demonstrates a level of analytical thinking and problem-solving. However, she has expressed some uncertainty about her current job search and the challenges she faces. This suggests she recognizes her logical reasoning skills but may not view them as overwhelmingly superior to others. Therefore, she is likely to choose a moderate score, acknowledging her capabilities without overstating them.",

She also engages in activities like networking, preparing for interviews, and tailoring her resume, which require logical and methodical approaches.

She has described herself as resilient and persistent in her job search, indicating a level of patience and thoroughness in her approach.

This aligns more closely with someone who would choose a higher number on this scale.",
            "REI_9": "Based on Lisa's interview, she appears to be someone who is analytical and values rational thinking. She has described herself as liberal and independent, which suggests she values logical reasoning and critical thinking. Additionally, her focus on economic development and social justice indicates a preference for systematic and evidence-based approaches to problem-solving.

            "REI_10": "Based on Lisa's reflections, she seems to have a strong sense of purpose and a commitment to aligning her career with her values. She mentions making significant life choices, such as volunteering full-time at a non-profit and pursuing a career in economic development, which suggests she has clear reasons for her decisions.
