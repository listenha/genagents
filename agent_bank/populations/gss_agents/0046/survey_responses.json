            "BFI-10_1": "Based on Lisa's description, she has a history of being involved in student politics and activism, which suggests she is likely more outgoing and sociable. However, the interview also mentions that she has been putting in a lot of effort into her job search, which can be a solitary and introspective process. This indicates that she might also have moments of reserved behavior. Given her overall description and the context of the job search, it seems that she is more on the reserved side, but not entirely so.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on Lisa's interview, she seems to be someone who values community and connection, as evidenced by her strong relationships with her family and friends, and her involvement in community service. Her willingness to volunteer and connect with others in her field suggests that she is open and trusting of others. Additionally, her reflections on the importance of support systems and the value of community indicate a trusting nature.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Lisa's description of her current situation, particularly her focus on job searching and her commitment to making a positive impact in her community, it is unlikely that she sees herself as lazy. She has been actively involved in her job search and has described various activities and commitments that show her engagement and dedication.

            "BFI-10_4": "Based on Lisa's interview, she has expressed experiencing periods of anxiety and stress, particularly due to the job search. However, she has also mentioned using coping strategies like exercise, mindfulness, and therapy to manage her stress. This suggests she is able to handle stress to some extent, but it is clearly a challenge for her. Given this balance, it seems more likely that she would rate herself a 3 or slightly lower, but leaning towards the middle of the scale to reflect her ability to handle stress with some effort.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on Lisa's responses, she describes herself as someone who is deeply involved in activism, community service, and professional pursuits. While she mentions participating in some community events and connecting with friends who share her values, there's no indication of her having a strong interest in traditional arts like painting or music. Her focus seems to be more on social and economic development. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that Lisa would lean towards the lower end of the scale, indicating fewer artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on Lisa's description, she has a strong network of family and friends, participates in various community events, and engages in activities like joining a book club and collaborating with friends.

She emphasizes the importance of education and helping others, which suggests she is more likely to be understanding and compassionate towards others. While she may encounter difficulties in her job search, she focuses on personal growth and learning from rejections, indicating a more forgiving and empathetic approach to others. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that she would not tend to find fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on the interview, Lisa describes herself as someone who is deeply passionate about making a positive impact in her community and is committed to her career goals. She mentions that she has been putting in a lot of effort into her job search, tailoring her resume and cover letters, and networking. This indicates that she values thoroughness and attention to detail in her work. Additionally, her involvement in student politics and activism suggests a meticulous approach to her commitments. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that she would choose a higher number on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Lisa Johnson has described herself as dealing with anxiety and stress due to her job search, which can be a significant source of nervousness and worry. However, she also mentions that she has been implementing coping strategies like journaling and mindfulness practices, indicating that she is actively working to manage her nervousness. This suggests that while she experiences nervousness, she is not constantly overwhelmed by it. Therefore, a middle ground between 1 and 5 seems appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on Lisa's background and personality described in the interview, she seems to be someone who is thoughtful and engaged in meaningful causes, but there isn't much indication that she is highly imaginative or creative.

Throughout the interview, she described her involvement in student politics, activism, and community service, indicating that she is thoughtful and strategic in her actions.

She also mentions that she relies on the emotional support of her family and close friends during tough times. This suggests that Lisa is more reserved and prefers having a smaller, close-knit support network.

            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Lisa's detailed profile and her proactive approach to her job search, as well as her emphasis on her commitment to making a positive impact in her community, it is unlikely that she would see herself as lazy. Her dedication to her career and her willingness to put in effort despite the challenges of unemployment suggests she is not someone who avoids effort or prefers to do as little as possible.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on Lisa's reflections and the challenges she has been facing, such as the stress of job searching and dealing with uncertainty, it seems unlikely that she would rate herself as someone who handles stress well. While she does mention implementing coping strategies like journaling and mindfulness, the persistent nature of her job search and the emotional toll it takes suggest that she may struggle with stress more than she would like to admit. However, she has shown resilience and a positive outlook, which indicates she is not completely overwhelmed by stress. Therefore, a moderate score seems appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Lisa mentioned that she does not speak other languages and does not have a significant background in religion or spirituality. While she values community service and activism, there is no indication that she has artistic interests.

            "BFI-10_8": "Based on the interview, Lisa describes herself as someone who is deeply passionate about her career and committed to making a positive impact in her community. Her involvement in student politics, activism, and volunteer work at a non-profit organization suggests that she takes her work seriously and aims to do it well. Additionally, she mentions that she has been working on tailoring her resume and cover letters, and reaching out to people in her field, indicating a level of attention to detail and a desire to do a thorough job. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that she would choose a higher number on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Lisa describes herself as experiencing stress and anxiety, particularly during her job search. She mentions dealing with anxiety over rejections and the pressure of finding the right job. Given her acknowledgment of these feelings and the challenges she faces, it's reasonable to conclude that she would not rate herself as someone who never gets nervous. However, she also doesn't seem to be someone who experiences nervousness constantly or in every situation. Her awareness and efforts to manage her anxiety suggest a moderate level of nervousness rather than a constant state of nervousness.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Lisa describes herself as someone who has been involved in activism, volunteering, and professional pursuits that require analytical and strategic thinking. While she does engage in community service and social justice causes, there isn't a strong indication of her being deeply immersed in imaginative or abstract thinking.
