She mentions that she finds comfort in talking things over with her husband and close friends, indicating that she does engage in social interactions. However, she also emphasizes the importance of self-care and maintaining a good routine, suggesting a preference for balance and not necessarily being overly outgoing. Her description aligns more with someone who is comfortable in social settings but also values personal time and privacy, which leans towards being reserved rather than outgoing.",

While she does experience stress, especially when planning for the future, she finds that keeping busy and maintaining a routine helps her stay on track. This suggests she is not at the extreme end of handling stress poorly, but also not at the extreme end of handling it exceptionally well. However, given that she acknowledges the presence of stress and takes steps to manage it, she is likely closer to the middle to slightly above middle of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on Laura's interview responses, she seems to value education and practical work, as seen in her choice to pursue higher education and her part-time job at a bookstore.

Additionally, she describes herself as feeling 'pretty good' about her current financial situation and is grateful for the support in her life. These details suggest that she is generally able to handle stress effectively and does not feel overly anxious or nervous. Therefore, it is more likely that she would choose a lower number on the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Laura Wright seems to be someone who values stability and practicality, as evidenced by her conservative political views and preference for a structured lifestyle.
