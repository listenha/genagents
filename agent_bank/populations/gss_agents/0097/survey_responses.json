            "BFI-10_3": "Given Jennifer's detailed description of her active and responsible life, including her work as a program manager at a non-profit, involvement in community initiatives, and commitment to public service, it is unlikely that she sees herself as lazy.

However, she does not mention any specific difficulties with complex problem-solving or suggest that she feels overwhelmed by complicated issues. Her involvement in activism and community work indicates a willingness to engage with and solve challenging problems. Therefore, it is more likely that she would fall closer to the higher end of the range.",

As a program manager at a non-profit focused on environmental policy, she must frequently analyze data, plan strategies, and solve problems logically. This suggests she is not someone who finds it difficult to handle logical analysis tasks. Furthermore, her involvement in community initiatives and her work at a non-profit indicate a commitment to thorough and considered decision-making. Therefore, it is unlikely that Jennifer would choose 1.",
