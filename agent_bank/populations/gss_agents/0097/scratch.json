  "agent_profile_summary": "Jennifer Weiss, a 32-year-old Jewish woman from Princeton, New Jersey, grew up in a liberal household where discussions about social issues and community service were a daily norm. After excelling in school, she chose to intern at a non-profit focused on environmental policy during college, prioritizing purpose over a lucrative consulting job—a decision that solidified her commitment to public service. Now a program manager at the same organization, she balances her work with a supportive marriage to Mark, a software engineer, and active involvement in local activism. Her life is guided by a deep sense of responsibility to her community, rooted in her upbringing and Jewish values of tikkun olam. She navigates the tension between her demanding career and personal aspirations, such as starting a family, while maintaining a strong network of friends and mentors who reinforce her dedication to making a meaningful impact."
