Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nRyan Otoole: Well, I was born in Portland, Oregon, and I've spent most of my life here. Growing up, my family was pretty average\u2014my dad didn't go to college, just finished high school, and worked a steady job, while my mom earned a bachelor's degree and has always been pretty career-focused. We lived in a modest house on Pine Street, and I remember growing up with a lot of family dinners and holidays with relatives from Ireland. I was raised as a Protestant, but I haven't been religious for a while now. I went to a public high school, and after that, I took a few years off before starting community college. I'm still in school now, working toward a degree in something I'm interested in, though I haven't decided exactly what yet. Life hasn't been too dramatic\u2014no big moves or dramatic events, just the usual ups and downs of growing up, figuring out who I am, and trying to find my path.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nRyan Otoole: Yeah, there was a moment like that\u2014right after high school. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, and I didn't want to just jump into college right away. So I took a year off and worked at a local bookstore on the edge of town. It was a small place, owned by an older couple who had been there for decades. I learned a lot from them, not just about books, but about patience, about people, and about the quiet kind of life that can be fulfilling in its own way. But after a while, I started to feel like I was just going through the motions. I wasn't growing, and I wasn't really challenged. That's when I realized I needed to push myself, to take that next step. I went back to school, started at community college, and slowly began to figure out what I was interested in. That experience at the bookstore was a crossroads\u2014it showed me what I didn't want, but it also gave me the perspective I needed to make a decision that felt right for me.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nRyan Otoole: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made all at once. It was more like a slow realization, like when you're walking through a forest and you suddenly notice the path you're on isn't the one you wanted to take. I didn't have a big moment with a lightbulb going off or anything dramatic. It was more about feeling stuck and then deciding, okay, I need to move forward. I think I was lucky in that I had people around me\u2014my mom, especially\u2014who encouraged me to keep going. She always said, 'If you don't take the risk, you'll always wonder what could have been.' That stuck with me. So I made the choice to go back to school, even though I was scared and unsure. I think that moment at the bookstore was the push I needed to realize I didn't want to be in a place where I wasn't growing. It wasn't just about education, it was about finding purpose, and that choice to take that step has shaped a lot of who I am today.\n\n",

I remember talking to a teacher once, Mr. Delaney, who noticed I was kind of drifting after high school. He didn't push me, but he did ask me what I was thinking about doing, and he said something like, 'Sometimes the hardest part is just starting.' That stuck with me. I wish I had reached out more to people like him or maybe even a counselor at the community college. I think having someone to talk to about the fear of failure or the pressure to have everything figured out would have made a difference. But I also think I needed to be in that place where I felt stuck before I could make the change. It wasn't just about getting help\u2014it was about being ready to accept it.\n\n",

She's in her early twenties too, and she's actually the one who pushed me to go back to school. She was always the more driven one, and I think she saw me kind of stuck and wanted me to have a better path than she thought I was on. My parents are still pretty involved in my life, even though they're not the most hands-on. My dad works at a local manufacturing plant, and my mom is a nurse at one of the hospitals here in Portland. They both support me, even if they don't always understand what I'm studying or why I'm still in school. I think my sister is the one who really gets it, though. She's studying business, and she always says I need to find something that makes me excited to get up in the morning. I don't know what that is yet, but I'm working on it.\n\n",

I never thought of it as a crossroads at the time, but looking back, it was a moment that defined my path.

My grandfather on my mom's side was a teacher there, and he always had this way of making you feel like you could do anything if you just tried. My grandmother, on the other hand, was more the storyteller in the family\u2014she'd sit for hours and tell us about growing up in Dublin, about the way the streets looked back in the day, and about her own struggles to get where she wanted to be. I don't see them as often as I'd like, but when I do, it's always like stepping back into a different time. My mom still keeps in touch with them, and she'll often share stories from their letters. I think that's why I always felt connected to Ireland, even though I was born here. It's like part of me is there, even if I've never set foot in the country.

One of them is Jordan, who I met in high school. We were in the same classes, and we kind of grew up together. He ended up going to a different college, but we still keep in touch. He's always been the more adventurous one, and I think he's the one who made me realize that life doesn't have to be safe or predictable to be worth living. Then there's Sam, who I met when I started working at the bookstore. She was a regular customer, always picking up a few books and staying for hours. We talked about everything\u2014books, music, life, the future. She was the one who really made me think about what I wanted out of life, and she encouraged me to take that step back to school. I don't know if I would have done it without her. I guess what I'm trying to say is, even though my life hasn't been super dramatic, the people I've met along the way have made all the difference.

It's a mix of older homes and some newer apartments, and there's this little park right down the street where I like to sit and read or just think. The area has this kind of laid-back vibe, which I guess fits with my personality. There's a lot of young people around\u2014students, artists, people who are just starting out in life. I like that about it. It feels like a place where things are still unfolding, and you can be part of that process. There's a coffee shop nearby that I go to almost every day, and the owner, Ms. Lin, knows me by name. She's one of those people who just makes you feel at home, even if you're just there for a cup of coffee. I think the neighborhood has helped me in a lot of ways, just by being a place where I can be myself without too much pressure.

People know each other, and there's this unspoken understanding that we're all just trying to get by and make the most of our lives. I think that contributes to the safety\u2014not just in a physical sense, but in the way people treat each other. I've never had any real issues, and I think that's because the neighborhood has this kind of quiet respect for one another.

The quiet, laid-back vibe is great for someone like me who doesn't need a lot of noise or chaos to feel grounded. I like being close to the college, and the fact that I can walk to most places without a car is a relief. But it's not without its challenges. Sometimes, being in a place where everyone's still figuring things out can be a bit overwhelming. There's this pressure to be successful or to have your life together by a certain age, and I think that's something a lot of people here feel. I've definitely felt that pressure, especially when I was stuck in that bookstore phase, wondering if I was just wasting time. But at the same time, there's something comforting about being surrounded by people who are in the same boat. You don't feel alone in your uncertainty.

I usually wake up around 8 or 9 in the morning, have a quick breakfast\u2014something simple like toast and coffee\u2014and then head to class. I'm taking a mix of general education courses and some intro-level classes in what I think might be my eventual field, though I'm still not entirely sure what that is. I like the flexibility of community college, where I can explore different subjects without feeling like I'm committing to a path too early. After class, I'll usually stop by the coffee shop near my apartment, chat with Ms. Lin for a bit, and then head back home to study or just relax. On days when I don't have class, I'll often spend the morning at the park, reading or just thinking, and then maybe meet up with Jordan or Sam for lunch or a walk.

It's a good way to stay connected to the community and also gives me a chance to read a lot more than I otherwise would.

At first, I just thought it was stress, and I tried to manage it with better sleep and eating habits, but it didn't go away completely.

The headaches and the hypertension diagnosis were a wake-up call, and while I haven't had to take time off from work or school, they've forced me to slow down and be more intentional about how I manage my time and energy. I used to think that pushing through stress was the only way to get things done, but now I see that it's not sustainable. It's affected how I approach my studies\u2014instead of trying to cram everything in, I'm learning to pace myself, take breaks, and listen to my body when it's telling me to rest.

It wasn't full-blown depression, but there were definitely days when I felt weighed down by the weight of it all. I remember one particular moment during my first semester at community college when I was overwhelmed with assignments and worried about whether I was on the right path. I didn't want to disappoint my family or myself, and that pressure made it hard to breathe sometimes. But I've been working on it\u2014talking to a counselor, practicing mindfulness, and learning to be more patient with myself.

They don't say it out loud, but I can tell they're proud of me for going back to school, especially since I didn't have a clear plan at first. My mom, in particular, has been really encouraging\u2014she always reminds me that it's okay to take your time and that success doesn't have to look the same for everyone. My dad, on the other hand, is more reserved, but he's shown his support in quieter ways, like making sure I have a meal ready when I get home from class or checking in on me when I'm stressed. My sister, Claire, has been the most vocal about it. She's always pushing me to be better, to take risks, and to not settle for anything less than what I want. She's the one who really made me realize that I didn't have to be afraid of uncertainty. Even though it's been tough for them to watch me go through this process, I think they've been patient because they know I'm trying my best.

I was raised as a Protestant, and I remember going to church with my family when I was younger, especially around holidays or during important family events.

I never really questioned it at the time\u2014I just kind of drifted away. Now, I don't think of myself as religious, but I do believe in something bigger than myself, even if I can't put it into words. I think it's more about the quiet moments, the way the world feels when you're sitting in a park or watching the sunrise, and how those moments remind you that you're part of something larger.

I live in a small apartment on the east side of Portland, and the rent is about $800 a month. It's not too bad for the area, but it takes up a good chunk of my budget. Groceries are another thing\u2014since I try to cook most of my meals at home, I end up spending around $200 to $250 a month on food. Tuition at the community college is about $100 per credit, and I'm taking around 12 credits this semester, so that's roughly $1,200 for the term. I also have some other smaller expenses, like transportation, utilities, and the occasional coffee or meal out. I work part-time at the library, which helps cover some of these costs, but I still have to be pretty careful with my money. I've been trying to track my spending more closely, and I've also started setting aside a little bit each month for emergencies. It's not much, but it's something.

Rent is the biggest chunk, as I mentioned, and then groceries, tuition, and transportation.

In the winter, heating costs went up a bit, which I didn't expect since I thought the apartment was pretty well insulated. I had to start using the space heater more, and that added a few extra dollars to my electricity bill. Then there were the holidays\u2014December was a bit more expensive because I bought a few gifts for my family back in Ireland, and I also treated myself to a new pair of running shoes since I've been trying to get back into shape.

The work at the bookstore was pretty straightforward\u2014helping customers find books, restocking shelves, and managing the checkout counter.

I didn't really take on multiple jobs because I wanted to focus on figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I think I was afraid of spreading myself too thin, especially when I was still trying to decide if I wanted to go to college or not. Once I went back to school, working part-time at the library was the only job I needed to keep things balanced. I didn't want to overcommit, especially with how uncertain everything still felt. It's funny, though\u2014I used to think having more than one job would make me more responsible or independent, but I think it's better to have one job that fits well with your life and goals. I'm still learning, but I think that's something I've come to understand over time.\n\n",

Talking about my stress levels and coping strategies reminded me that growth isn't just about big moments\u2014it's also about learning to manage the little things, like anxiety or uncertainty, in a way that feels sustainable. It also made me realize how much my family's quiet support has been a constant in my life, even when I didn't always recognize it. Discussing my finances and budgeting habits brought up how much I've been learning to be more intentional with my money, not just for practical reasons, but also as a way to feel more in control of my life. I used to think that being productive meant pushing through everything without pause, but now I see that rest, reflection, and even small savings can be just as important. These questions helped me see that my well-being isn't just about big decisions or dramatic changes\u2014it's about the small, consistent choices I make every day to stay grounded, healthy, and connected to the people who care about me.",

I don't make a lot, but it's enough to cover the basics. I've been trying to be more intentional about how I spend and save, even if it's just a few dollars at a time. It's not about being rich or having everything figured out\u2014it's about making the most of what I have and knowing that I'm working toward something bigger.

The hours are flexible, which is something I really appreciate because it allows me to balance work with school and my other responsibilities. As for benefits, the library offers a basic health insurance plan that I can enroll in, though I haven't taken it up yet because I'm still figuring out my long-term plans. They also give us a few days of paid time off each year, which is nice to have, even if I don't use it much. I think the biggest benefit of the job, though, is the sense of community it gives me. I've gotten to know a lot of the regulars\u2014students, teachers, even some local authors\u2014and it's made me feel more connected to the place I live. It's not a high-paying job, and it doesn't come with a lot of perks, but it's steady, and it gives me a chance to do something that feels meaningful, even in small ways.\n\n",

My manager, Ms. Carter, is someone I really admire. She's been in the library for years and has this calm, steady presence that makes you feel like you can ask her anything. She's never been pushy or overly demanding, which I think is part of why I've stayed here. I've learned a lot from her, not just about the job, but about how to be patient and how to treat people with kindness. I think the best part of working there is that it feels like a second home in a way\u2014no one is judging you, and everyone just wants to help each other out.

He always said it wasn't about making a lot of money\u2014it was about having a job that gave you a sense of purpose and allowed you to provide for your family.

It was a pretty physical job\u2014he stood on his feet for most of the day, and there was a lot of repetition involved. But he always said it was satisfying in its own way because you could see the end result of your work, even if it was just a small part of a bigger machine. His most important duties were making sure everything was assembled correctly and safely, following the guidelines strictly because even a small mistake could cause problems down the line. He never talked about it much, but I think he took pride in knowing that his work contributed to something bigger, even if he didn't get to see it. My mom, on the other hand, was a nurse at one of the hospitals here in Portland. Her work was more demanding in terms of emotional labor\u2014she was always on her feet, dealing with patients, their families, and the pressures of the healthcare system. Her most important activities were making sure her patients were comfortable, monitoring their conditions, and providing care that went beyond just the medical aspect.

It was one of those places where you'd walk in and immediately feel the hum of machines and the smell of metal in the air. They made parts for everything from construction equipment to agricultural machinery. He was part of the assembly line, and while it wasn't the most glamorous job, he always said it had its own kind of rhythm. He'd start his day early, sometimes before sunrise, and spend most of it standing at his station, putting together components with precision. He never talked about the long hours or the physical toll it took on him, but I could tell it was hard work. My mom, on the other hand, worked for a hospital called St. Mary's Medical Center. It was a big, busy place, and she was part of the emergency department. She was always on her feet, moving from one patient to another, and I think that's why she always looked so tired when she came home. She didn't just treat patients\u2014she listened to them, comforted them, and made sure they felt seen.
