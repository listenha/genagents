            "BFI-10_1": "Ryan Otoole describes himself as someone who prefers quiet, laid-back environments, enjoys reading and reflecting, and values meaningful connections over social performances. He also mentions not being on social media much and preferring face-to-face conversations over online interactions. These traits align more with being reserved rather than outgoing.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Ryan Otoole describes himself as someone who values connection and community, and he has spoken positively about the people in his life, including his family, friends, and coworkers. He also mentions feeling safe in his neighborhood and being part of a supportive community. These factors suggest a generally trusting disposition, though not overly naive or blind to potential risks.",
            "BFI-10_3": "The participant describes a life filled with consistent routines, efforts to improve health, and a commitment to education and self-reflection. They acknowledge past periods of stagnation but emphasize growth and intentionality. They also show a clear effort to manage their time, responsibilities, and mental health, which suggests they do not see themselves as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Ryan has discussed his struggles with anxiety and stress, particularly around his future and academic responsibilities. He has mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times, though he has also made efforts to manage his stress through routines like running, yoga, and talking to a counselor. He doesn’t seem to handle stress effortlessly, but he is actively working on it, which suggests he is somewhere in the middle. However, his overall tone and reflection suggest he is more on the side of being able to manage stress, even if not perfectly.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant describes a life centered around routine, community, and practicality—working at a library, attending community college, and focusing on stability. While they mention enjoying books and reading, there is no explicit mention of engaging in or expressing artistic interests beyond that. They do not describe any hobbies or activities that would suggest a strong artistic inclination, such as painting, music, or creative writing.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Ryan Otoole describes himself as someone who prefers quiet, laid-back environments and values meaningful connections over large social gatherings. He mentions enjoying time in the park, reading, and having deep conversations with friends like Sam and Jordan, but he does not emphasize a need for constant social interaction or being the center of attention. His personality seems more reflective and introspective, suggesting a lower score on the outgoing, sociable scale.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Throughout the interview, Ryan Otoole displays a reflective, self-aware, and empathetic nature. He acknowledges his own struggles with anxiety and uncertainty, and he often speaks about the support he has received from his family and friends. He also emphasizes the importance of community, kindness, and understanding in his life. There is no indication that he is prone to finding fault with others or being overly critical of them.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Ryan Otoole describes himself as someone who is still figuring things out, often balancing school, work, and personal life. He acknowledges that he sometimes feels overwhelmed and has learned to be more intentional about his time and responsibilities. While he values growth and learning, he also admits to being in a process and not always having everything figured out. This suggests he may not see himself as someone who consistently does a thorough job, but rather someone who is learning and improving over time.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Ryan has mentioned experiencing anxiety, particularly around the pressure of making decisions about his future and the fear of not being good enough. He described having moments of feeling overwhelmed and stressed, especially during school or when juggling responsibilities. While he has been working on managing his anxiety through counseling and self-care, he still acknowledges that it is a part of his life. This suggests he would rate himself somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale, but not the highest.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Ryan Otoole reflects on his life with a focus on personal growth, relationships, and small, meaningful experiences. While he doesn't explicitly mention imagination or creativity, his introspective nature and appreciation for stories (e.g., from his grandmother, his bookstore experience, and his reflections on life) suggest he has a thoughtful and reflective imagination. However, he doesn't describe himself as someone who is particularly imaginative or creative in a bold or artistic way. His self-perception seems more grounded in practicality and introspection than in vivid imagination."

            "BES-A_4": "Ryan Otoole describes himself as someone who is reflective, values connection, and is often in a state of uncertainty or self-doubt. He mentions struggling with anxiety and feeling overwhelmed at times, and he is more inclined to take a step-by-step approach to life. He also emphasizes the importance of support from others, like his sister and friends, rather than taking charge in high-pressure moments.

He mentions being able to recognize his own stress and anxiety and has been working on managing them. While he doesn't explicitly discuss his ability to read others' emotions, his emphasis on relationships, support systems, and being present suggests he is somewhat attuned to others' emotional states. However, he doesn't demonstrate an exceptional or highly developed ability to read others' emotions, which would be more aligned with a 5. A 3 seems more likely as a middle ground.",
            "BES-A_8": "Ryan Otoole describes having meaningful relationships with friends like Jordan and Sam, who have influenced his life and supported him during key moments. He reflects on how these friends have helped him grow and make decisions, indicating he is aware of their feelings and values their input. This suggests he is empathetic and socially attuned.",

He is reflective and aware of how people around him influence his life. He also shows emotional awareness in his responses about his own mental health and how he interacts with others.

He mentions struggling with anxiety around making decisions and feeling uncertain about his future. While he is working toward a degree and exploring different subjects, he also acknowledges that he is not always sure what he wants. This suggests a moderate level of self-perceived problem-solving ability, not extremely low but also not extremely high.",
            "REI_2": "Ryan Otoole describes himself as someone who is still figuring things out, values learning and growth, and has been working on managing stress and anxiety. While he shows a reflective and thoughtful nature, there is no explicit mention of him being particularly skilled in logical analysis or problem-solving. He seems more introspective and values emotional and social connections over analytical tasks.

He often emphasizes thoughtful reflection, self-awareness, and learning from experiences, which suggests he does engage in careful reasoning. While he acknowledges uncertainty and the process of figuring things out, he also shows a clear ability to analyze his life and make intentional choices.",
            "REI_5": "Ryan Otoole has discussed his struggles with anxiety and stress, particularly around making decisions about his future and managing his school and work responsibilities. He has acknowledged feeling overwhelmed at times, especially during exam periods or when juggling multiple responsibilities. While he has made progress in managing his stress and learning to be more mindful, he has not demonstrated a strong ability to remain calm or think clearly under pressure. His self-reported experiences suggest he would lean toward agreeing with this statement.",
            "REI_6": "Ryan describes himself as someone who is still figuring things out, often reflecting on his life in a thoughtful and introspective way. He mentions making decisions slowly, being influenced by people around him, and not having a clear sense of direction. This suggests a more intuitive or reflective approach rather than a strictly logical one. He also talks about uncertainty and not always knowing what he wants, which aligns more with a lower score on logical reasoning confidence.",
            "REI_7": "Ryan Otoole describes himself as someone who is reflective, introspective, and values personal connections and growth. While he shows some ability to analyze his life and make decisions (e.g., returning to school, managing his health), he doesn't emphasize logical thinking or structured reasoning as a defining trait. His narrative is more about emotional and personal growth, relationships, and finding purpose rather than logical or analytical processes.",

He mentions moments of realization, such as his time at the bookstore, and how he made decisions slowly over time.

            "REI_9": "Ryan Otoole reflects on his life as one of gradual growth, self-reflection, and emotional awareness. He often emphasizes the importance of intuition, personal reflection, and the support of others in navigating life. While he acknowledges the importance of structure and planning (e.g., budgeting, routines), he also highlights the role of emotional and social factors in decision-making. He doesn’t frame his approach to life as primarily logical or analytical, but rather as a balance of experience, reflection, and support from others.",
            "REI_10": "Ryan Otoole describes his life as one of gradual realization and quiet decisions. He often reflects on how his choices were influenced by people around him, his environment, and small moments of clarity. He acknowledges that he didn’t always have clear reasons for his decisions, especially during times of uncertainty, and that some of his choices were more about feeling stuck or seeking growth rather than a deliberate plan. This suggests he leans more toward the lower end of the scale, as he often reflects on decisions as being shaped by experience and external influences rather than clear, premeditated reasoning."

While they didn't explicitly mention artistic interests, they showed an appreciation for literature and creative environments like libraries and bookstores.

He acknowledges moments of feeling stuck or overwhelmed, such as when he was working at the bookstore or during times of academic pressure. He also mentions that he values growth and learning, but it is a slow and reflective process. This suggests he may not feel particularly confident in solving complicated problems quickly or decisively.",
            "REI_2": "Ryan Otoole describes himself as someone who is reflective, values learning, and is working on managing stress and uncertainty. He acknowledges his anxiety and the pressure of making decisions about his future, which suggests he may not always feel confident in logical analysis. However, he also shows a willingness to grow, explore, and take time to think through things, which indicates some level of analytical capability. He doesn’t explicitly mention being good or bad at logical analysis, but his introspective nature and focus on emotional and social aspects of life may lean him toward a middle or lower end of the scale.",

He reflects on his life in a narrative, emotional, and introspective way, often focusing on personal relationships and small, meaningful experiences.

He has also reflected on how he used to push through stress without considering its impact on his mental health.

This suggests he may lean toward agreeing with the statement.",

He mentions how he took time to consider returning to school after working at the bookstore, and he often reflects on his life choices and the people who influence him.

He mentions having a few close friends and coworkers he connects with, but he does not actively seek out large social groups or events.

He reflects on how these relationships have influenced him and how people around him have supported him.

He values personal connections, quiet moments, and emotional growth over rigid planning or analysis.

            "REI_5": "Ryan has described experiencing anxiety and stress, particularly around academic and life decisions. He has mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times, such as during midterms or when juggling responsibilities. He also reflects on the importance of managing stress and taking breaks, which suggests he does not always reason well under pressure. His self-awareness of his anxiety and need to slow down indicates a tendency to struggle in high-pressure situations.",

He describes himself as someone who is still figuring things out and values balance, emotional connection, and gradual progress.

            "REI_7": "Ryan Otoole reflects on his life with a focus on personal growth, emotional experiences, and the influence of relationships and community. While he does show some analytical thinking (e.g., budgeting, planning for the future), his narrative is more introspective and emotionally driven.
