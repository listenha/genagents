  "agent_profile_summary": "Claire Romero, a 41-year-old human resources professional in Newton, Massachusetts, grew up in a close-knit family that valued education and community. After earning a bachelor’s in psychology, she made a deliberate shift from clinical work to organizational psychology during her junior year, inspired by an internship at a nonprofit that revealed her passion for systemic support over direct care. Now, she works full-time at a tech company, where she fosters inclusive workplace cultures and leads diversity initiatives. A committed caregiver, she maintains strong ties with her two adult children and parents, balancing her role as a single mother with her career and personal well-being. Claire’s life reflects a steady commitment to growth and connection, whether through her mindfulness practices, community volunteering, or the stability of her Newton neighborhood, all of which shape her thoughtful, grounded approach to both work and relationships."
