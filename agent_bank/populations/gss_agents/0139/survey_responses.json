            "BFI-10_6": "Claire describes herself as a quiet kid who was more into books than sports, and while she has close relationships with family and a few friends, she does not emphasize being outgoing or sociable in her life story.

While she is methodical in her work (e.g., budgeting, planning, and organizing HR initiatives), she also emphasizes emotional intelligence, personal growth, and the importance of community. Her approach to problem-solving seems to balance logic with emotional awareness, but she does not explicitly prioritize logic as her primary tool. Instead, she leans on relationships, reflection, and experience.",
            "REI_10": "Claire frequently reflects on her decisions, often explaining the rationale behind her career path, personal choices, and life transitions.

She discusses her work in human resources, her family life, and her mindfulness practices, but there is no indication of engagement with art, music, or other creative pursuits. Her personality seems more grounded, practical, and focused on community and stability rather than artistic expression.",

While she acknowledges feeling overwhelmed at times, she also emphasizes her efforts to stay grounded and her growing awareness of her mental health. This suggests she does experience nervousness, but not to an extreme degree. She seems to have developed coping strategies that help her manage it, which would place her somewhere in the middle of the range, but closer to the lower end due to her self-awareness and proactive approach.",
