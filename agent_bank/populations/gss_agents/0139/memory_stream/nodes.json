    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nClaire Romero: I was born in the United States, in a small town in New England, and I've lived in Newton, Massachusetts, since I was sixteen. My parents were both graduates, and they valued education a lot. My father was a teacher, and my mother worked as a nurse. We had a pretty average income, but it was enough to give me and my siblings a stable childhood. I remember growing up in a close-knit family, with both parents always encouraging us to pursue our dreams. I was a quiet kid, more into books than sports, and I always knew I wanted to go to college. I ended up earning a bachelor's degree in psychology, which led me to a career in human resources. Life hasn't always been easy\u2014my marriage didn't last, and I've had my share of challenges, but I've always tried to stay positive and focused on what matters most.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nClaire Romero: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped the course of my life. I was in my junior year of college, studying psychology, and I had the opportunity to intern at a local nonprofit that provided counseling services to underserved communities. At the time, I was torn between pursuing a more traditional career path, like becoming a therapist or counselor, or going into something more business-oriented, like human resources. I had always been interested in people and how they interact, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to work directly with individuals or in a more organizational role. I decided to take the internship, and it was there that I realized I was more passionate about the systems and structures that support people rather than working one-on-one with them. That experience led me to switch my focus to organizational psychology and eventually to a career in human resources. It was a pivotal decision because it aligned my interests with my strengths and gave me a sense of purpose that I hadn't felt before.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nClaire Romero: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made all at once. It was more of a realization that unfolded over time. I had always been drawn to understanding people and how they functioned within groups, but I didn't fully grasp how that could translate into a career until that internship. I remember sitting in my dorm room one night, staring at my notes, and thinking, 'What if I could help shape the environments where people thrive, instead of just helping individuals one at a time?' That moment was the catalyst. I made a list of pros and cons, talked it over with my advisor, and then committed to the path. It wasn't just about making a decision\u2014it was about aligning my values with my work, and that felt like a choice I had to make deliberately.\n\n",

My advisor at the time, Dr. Bennett, was incredibly supportive. He didn't push me toward any specific path, but he asked the right questions that made me reflect more deeply on what I truly wanted. Also, my mother, who had always worked in healthcare, gave me a different perspective. She told me about the challenges of working directly with patients and how important it was to have systems in place to support them. Her experience helped me see that I didn't have to choose between helping people and working in a more structured environment. I think both the people in my life and the organizations I was exposed to played a role in guiding me to the right decision, even if I was the one who had to take the first step.\n\n",

My son, Marco, is a software engineer in Boston, and my daughter, Elena, works in public relations in New York. They both stayed in touch with me throughout their upbringing, even though my divorce was a tough time for our family. I try to be involved in their lives as much as possible, whether it's through phone calls, video chats, or visiting when I can. I also have a close relationship with my parents, who still live in the same small town in New England where I was born. They're both retired now, and we get together for holidays and family gatherings. I think family is the foundation of who I am, and even though my life has taken some unexpected turns, I'm grateful for the relationships that have stood the test of time.\n\n",

It's interesting to reflect on how my decision to pursue human resources wasn't just a sudden choice, but a gradual realization that aligned with my values and strengths. I'm grateful for the support of my advisor, Dr. Bennett, and my mother, who helped me see the bigger picture. Even though my marriage didn't last, I'm proud of the relationships I've built with my children and my parents, who continue to be a source of love and stability in my life.

We don't see each other as often as I'd like, but we keep in touch through messages and occasional visits. He's always been more of a free spirit than I am, and I think that's why we sometimes have different perspectives on life. Still, I admire his ability to take risks and follow his passions. Our relationship has its ups and downs, but I know he's always had my back, especially during my divorce. He even flew up to Newton for a few days to help me move out of the house, which meant a lot.

One of them is Sarah, who I met in college. We were in the same psychology class, and we bonded over our shared interest in human behavior. She went on to become a social worker, and even though our careers took us in different directions, we've remained close. She's someone I can talk to about anything, and she's always been a source of support, especially during my divorce. Then there's my coworker, James, who I've known for over a decade. He's been a great mentor in my career, and we often grab coffee or lunch to catch up. He's helped me navigate the challenges of working in human resources, and I really value his perspective.

It's one of those places where you know your neighbors, and people look out for each other. The streets are lined with old, beautiful homes, many of which have been around for generations. I love walking around the area, especially in the fall when the leaves change colors and the air is crisp. There's a local park nearby where I like to take my dog for walks, and it's a great spot for people-watching. The town has a mix of families, professionals, and retirees, which gives it a nice balance of energy and calm. I've lived here for a while now, and even though I've had my share of life changes, this neighborhood has remained a constant.

There's a kind of quiet confidence that comes with living in a place where people know each other and look out for one another. I've walked alone at night, taken my kids to school without hesitation, and even left my door unlocked when I was home alone\u2014though I don't recommend that anymore, just saying. It's not just the physical safety, though; it's the emotional safety too. I know if something were wrong, someone would be there to help.

I've made friends with neighbors over the years\u2014some I've known for decades, others I've met through local events or the park.

I've learned to balance that by getting involved in community activities, like the local library's book club or the annual neighborhood potluck.

I also try to set aside some time for myself, whether it's reading, doing a puzzle, or just sitting on the porch and watching the world go by.

Both of them were involved in extracurricular activities\u2014Marco played on the school's soccer team and volunteered at a community center, while Elena was in theater and participated in debate club. After school, they'd often have homework, but they also made time for friends and hobbies.

I also had a mild case of depression after my divorce, which I addressed through therapy and mindfulness practices. I'm lucky to have a good relationship with my primary care doctor, who has been supportive in helping me manage both my physical and mental health. I try to eat well\u2014mostly whole foods, lean proteins, and plenty of vegetables\u2014and I've cut back on processed foods and sugar over the past few years.

My routine of walking with Max, practicing yoga, and reading before bed gives me a sense of structure that helps me stay on track.

I think it's partly due to the long hours I've been spending at my desk, especially with the rise of remote work and hybrid schedules.

Talking about my morning mindfulness practice, my dog walks, and the challenges of staying healthy in a busy life reminded me of how important it is to take small, consistent steps toward self-care. I used to think of health as something that would take up too much time or energy, but now I see it as a foundation that supports everything else\u2014my work, my relationships, and even my ability to cope with life's challenges. It's also made me more aware of how my body and mind are connected, and how something as simple as a morning walk or a few minutes of meditation can make a real difference in how I feel throughout the day. I'm still learning, and there are definitely days when I slip up or feel overwhelmed, but I'm trying to be more intentional about my health now, not just for myself, but for the people I love and the life I want to live.",

How about for you?\n\nClaire Romero: I think I've struggled with anxiety at times, especially during the transition after my divorce. There were moments when I felt overwhelmed by the responsibilities of being a single parent, managing my job, and trying to rebuild my life on my own. I remember feeling like I was constantly juggling too many things at once, and there were days when I didn't know where to start. I didn't want to burden anyone with my feelings, so I often kept it all inside. But over time, I realized that asking for help wasn't a weakness\u2014it was a strength. I started seeing a therapist, and that made a world of difference. It gave me a safe space to explore my emotions and work through the things that were holding me back. I also found that mindfulness and yoga helped me stay grounded when my thoughts started spiraling. I don't think I've ever been officially diagnosed with anxiety, but I know I've experienced it in different ways throughout my life. What's important to me now is that I'm more aware of my mental health and more willing to take care of it, even when it's hard.\n\n",

My son, Marco, was just starting his career when I went through the divorce, and he took on a lot more responsibility at home, helping me with things like cooking and managing the household. My daughter, Elena, was away at college, but she stayed in close contact and made sure I knew I wasn't alone. It wasn't easy for any of us, but I think we all grew from it in different ways. My parents, too, have been a steady presence\u2014my mother, in particular, has been a great source of wisdom and comfort. She's someone who's lived through her own share of challenges, and she's always reminded me that life has a way of sorting itself out if you stay strong and keep moving forward. I think the most important thing for my family has been learning how to communicate openly, even when things are hard. It's not perfect, but I feel like we've come out of it with a deeper understanding of each other and a stronger bond.\n\n",

How about you?\n\nClaire Romero: For me, religion has always been an important part of my life, though it's evolved over time. I was raised Catholic, and my parents made sure that faith was a central part of our family life. We attended Mass regularly, and I remember the sense of community and comfort that came with being part of that tradition. Even now, I still find value in the rituals and teachings of the Catholic Church, especially during times of reflection or challenge. That said, my spirituality has become more personal in recent years. I don't always attend Mass as often as I used to, but I still find solace in prayer, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed or in need of guidance. I think of my faith as something that's not just about doctrine or tradition, but about connection\u2014whether it's with God, with my family, or with the world around me. It's a source of strength, even if it's not always perfect or easy to understand.\n\n",

I've always been more of a private person, and I find that platforms like Facebook or Instagram can sometimes feel overwhelming or superficial. That said, I do use Facebook occasionally to stay in touch with family and old friends, especially since my children are living in different cities. I'll check in on their posts, share a few photos of my dog Max or my garden, and sometimes join in on family events or holidays. I think it's a way to stay connected without feeling like I have to curate my life for others. I also follow a few local community pages for Newton, which keep me informed about events and happenings in the neighborhood. But overall, I prefer face-to-face interactions or even a phone call over scrolling through feeds.

I've always found that the people I care about are the ones who show up in real life, not behind a screen. That said, there have been times when I've felt overwhelmed or isolated, and I've reached out to friends or family for support\u2014whether it was a phone call, a message, or just showing up at someone's door. I think the difference is that I've always preferred face-to-face connections, where you can really see someone's face, hear their voice, and feel their presence.

There were times when I felt like I was carrying everything on my own, and that weight was hard to shake. But I've been working on developing better coping strategies. One of the biggest changes has been how I approach mindfulness\u2014rather than just a quick meditation here and there, I've made it a daily practice. I also started journaling, which has been a huge help in processing my thoughts and emotions. It's amazing how writing things down can clarify what's going on inside. I've also leaned more on my support system, whether it's talking to my mother, catching up with Sarah, or even just having a quiet conversation with James at work.

I live in a modest home on Chestnut Hill Ave, and the mortgage payment is a consistent part of my budget. Groceries can be a bit of a challenge with my current schedule, but I try to plan meals in advance and buy in bulk when possible.

The majority of that goes toward the mortgage, which is about $1,500, and groceries, which typically run around $800 to $900 depending on the season and what's on sale.

For example, during the winter months, my heating bill went up significantly, which is something I wasn't fully prepared for. I had to adjust my budget a bit, cutting back on some discretionary spending to make sure I could cover the increased utility costs. Then, around the holidays, there were unexpected expenses\u2014like a new set of tires for my car, which I needed because the old ones were worn down, and a few small gifts for my kids and parents. On the flip side, I noticed that my grocery bills were a bit lower in the spring because I was able to buy more seasonal produce at local farmers' markets, which not only saved me money but also felt more meaningful. I also had a few months where my healthcare costs were higher due to additional physical therapy sessions, which I needed after a flare-up of my back pain.

It's not a lot, but it's enough to cover our monthly expenses and allow for a little extra for savings or unexpected costs. I've always believed in living within my means, and I try to be mindful of every dollar I earn. It's not about luxury\u2014it's about stability, security, and being able to provide for the things that matter most, like my health, my family, and the life I've built here in Newton.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nClaire Romero: I've been at my current job for about seven years now, and it's been a really rewarding experience. The company has a strong commitment to employee well-being, which is something I really appreciate. In terms of benefits, we have comprehensive health insurance that covers medical, dental, and vision, which is a huge relief, especially with my ongoing chiropractic care and any other health needs that come up. We also get a generous amount of paid time off\u2014around three weeks of vacation, plus sick days and personal days. I think the flexibility of the schedule is one of the best parts. While I do work a standard Monday through Friday schedule, I have the option to start a bit earlier or stay a bit later depending on what's needed. The company also offers a retirement plan with matching contributions, which is something I've been contributing to for years. I've always believed that a job is more than just a paycheck\u2014it's about the support, the stability, and the opportunities to grow. This workplace has given me all of that, and I'm really grateful for it.\n\n",

I've always valued collaboration, and I think that's something that comes through in how I interact with my manager and my coworkers. My manager, Linda, is someone I really respect\u2014she's supportive, fair, and has a great understanding of what it takes to lead a team. She's been a great mentor to me over the years, and I've learned a lot from watching how she handles challenges and leads with empathy. As for my coworkers, I have a good rapport with most of them. We work in different departments, but there's a strong sense of camaraderie, especially when we're working on projects that align with our shared goals of creating a positive workplace culture. I think the key to our relationships is that we all bring different strengths to the table, and we're willing to support each other when needed. There are, of course, the usual office dynamics\u2014some people are more competitive, others more laid-back\u2014but I've found that focusing on common goals and mutual respect helps keep things running smoothly. I wouldn't say I'm the most outgoing person, but I do enjoy the connections I've built over the years, and I feel like I'm part of a team that genuinely cares about each other's success.\n\n",

I typically start around 8:30 a.m. and finish around 5:30 p.m., though I often stay a bit later when there are meetings or projects that need attention. The company has a flexible policy that allows me to adjust my hours a bit, as long as I'm available for core team meetings and client interactions. That said, I do have to be at the office most days, especially when we're working on big initiatives or during busy seasons. I think the predictability of the schedule helps me balance my work and personal life, especially since my kids are adults and their schedules don't always align with mine.

I've learned over the years that it's not about having more, but about being mindful of what I have and making sure I'm not living paycheck to paycheck.

I've come to realize that being mindful of my expenses, whether it's adjusting for higher heating costs in the winter or saving for unexpected repairs, is just as important as the emotional coping strategies I've developed over the years. It's comforting to know that I have a stable income and a predictable work schedule, which gives me the freedom to focus on what truly matters\u2014my health, my family, and the life I've built here in Newton.

My mother worked as a nurse, and while her hours were a bit more unpredictable due to shifts at the hospital, she always made sure to be there for our family when it mattered most.

He often stayed late after school to help students who were struggling or to plan engaging activities for the classroom. My mother was a nurse at a local hospital, and her most important duties involved caring for patients, administering treatments, and providing emotional support during difficult times.

He didn't just stick to the textbook\u2014he encouraged critical thinking and often brought in guest speakers or organized field trips to help students connect what they were learning to the real world. My mother worked at Newton Medical Center, which is a hospital that serves the surrounding communities.
