            "REI_5": "Lilliana describes experiencing anxiety and stress, particularly around her health, financial stability, and future. She mentions struggling with self-doubt and feeling overwhelmed at times, which suggests she may not reason well under pressure.

She is intentional about her choices, such as balancing work, school, and caregiving, and she shows a clear understanding of her own growth and challenges.

            "REI_5": "Lilliana has described moments of anxiety and self-doubt, particularly when dealing with health issues, financial instability, and balancing multiple responsibilities. While she has shown resilience and determination, she also acknowledges feeling overwhelmed at times, especially when juggling work, school, and caregiving. This suggests she may feel that pressure impacts her ability to reason clearly, aligning more with the higher end of the scale.",

She emphasizes her artistic talents, her emotional coping strategies, and her relationships with others as central to her identity.

            "REI_7": "Lilliana's interview highlights her emotional depth, creativity, and reliance on personal experiences and relationships. While she shows some analytical thinking (e.g., managing her budget, planning her time), her narrative is more centered on emotional resilience, art, and community support.

While she does show some problem-solving abilities (e.g., managing her budget, balancing work and school), her narrative emphasizes emotional and relational strategies over strictly logical ones. She also reflects on her struggles with anxiety and uncertainty, which may suggest a more intuitive or feeling-based approach to problem-solving.",
            "REI_10": "Lilliana reflects on her life with a lot of introspection and self-awareness, often discussing her motivations, challenges, and the reasoning behind her choices (e.g., her decision to pursue art, her choice to take online classes, and her reflections on her family and health).

While she has made progress in managing her anxiety through therapy, journaling, and small coping strategies, she still acknowledges that she feels overwhelmed at times and struggles with self-doubt.
