            "BFI-10_1": "Lilliana describes herself as someone who was quiet as a child, often reading or drawing, and she reflects on her journey as one of self-discovery and growth. While she has become more confident and engaged in her community, she still shows signs of introspection and a preference for thoughtful reflection over immediate expression. However, she has also grown into a person who connects with others, shares her art, and engages in conversations about her life and goals.

            "BFI-10_4": "Lilliana has spoken openly about her struggles with anxiety and stress, particularly related to her health, financial situation, and balancing multiple responsibilities. While she has made progress in managing her stress through journaling, therapy, and small coping strategies, she still describes feeling overwhelmed at times and acknowledges the difficulty of maintaining balance. She does not present herself as someone who consistently handles stress well or feels relaxed, which suggests she would not score at the higher end of the range.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant has repeatedly emphasized her passion for art, especially painting, and has described how her artistic interests have shaped her life. She left home at 15 to pursue art, participated in a summer art program, and is currently working toward a career in graphic design. She also mentions creating art regularly and being inspired by other artists. This clearly indicates that she has a strong connection to artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Lilliana describes herself as someone who values connection, but she also mentions that she is not currently in a romantic relationship and is focused on her own growth. While she has close friends and a supportive community, she also reflects on her quiet nature as a child and her current focus on personal goals. She seems more introspective and deliberate in her interactions rather than highly outgoing or sociable in the traditional sense.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Lilliana describes herself as someone who has faced challenges, struggled with self-doubt, and has relied heavily on the support of others. She emphasizes the importance of community, understanding, and being supported by people who believe in her. She also reflects on the kindness and support she has received from others, including her grandmother, friends, and mentors. This suggests she is more inclined to be understanding and less likely to find fault with others.",

            "BFI-10_10": "Lilliana frequently discusses her passion for art, especially painting and graphic design, and describes how her imagination has been a driving force in her life. She talks about how her imagination helped her envision a different future for herself, such as through the summer art program and her current pursuit of graphic design. Her creative expression and ability to dream beyond her circumstances strongly align with someone who sees themselves as having an active imagination."
