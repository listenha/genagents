From my perspective, history is often shaped by forces beyond human control, and the story of dinosaurs reflects that. While I believe in progress and improvement in human civilization, I also recognize the role of randomness and chaos in shaping the world. Dinosaurs remind me that not everything in history is purposeful or linear, and this aligns more with the 'history is random' end of the spectrum."

While it suggests a new place, the imagery of candlelight often brings a sense of comfort and nostalgia. Given my own experiences of moving between places and the emotional weight of being in a new environment while still feeling connected to my roots, I believe the clue leans more toward homesickness.

While it has a distinct taste, it is not particularly zesty or bold. It lacks the strong, sharp, or vibrant flavors that would place it at the extreme end of the 'zesty' spectrum. However, it is also not completely bland—it has a noticeable sweetness and effervescence.
