Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nLilliana Sierra: I was born and raised in Miami, Florida, in a small apartment on the edge of the city. My parents worked hard to make ends meet, but things were always tight. My father worked as a mechanic, and my mother cleaned offices\u2014both had only finished high school. I remember growing up in a neighborhood where everyone knew each other, but there wasn't much in the way of opportunities. I was a quiet kid, always reading books or drawing in my notebook. I had a passion for art, especially painting, which my mother encouraged even though we couldn't afford supplies. I left home at 15 to go to a boarding school in the South Atlantic region, which was a big change for me. It was tough at first, but I found my confidence there. I graduated high school and came back to Miami, but I never really felt like I belonged there anymore. I've been working a part-time job at a local caf\u00e9, but I've been thinking about going back to school to study graphic design. Life hasn't been easy, but I've always tried to keep my head up and believe in something bigger than myself.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nLilliana Sierra: Yes, there was one moment that changed everything for me. It was right after I turned 16, when I was still at that boarding school in the South Atlantic. I had been struggling with feeling out of place and unsure of my future. One day, during an art class, the teacher saw my sketchbook and asked me to stay after class. She told me I had a real talent for visual storytelling and encouraged me to apply for a summer art program at a community college. I was hesitant at first because I didn't think I had the resources or support to do something like that. But she helped me write a letter of recommendation and even connected me with a local artist who donated some supplies. That summer, I spent every day painting and learning new techniques. It was the first time I felt like I had a real purpose. When I came back to Miami, I realized I didn't want to settle for the same life I had before. That experience gave me the courage to dream bigger and to believe that I could create a different future for myself, even if it meant taking risks and stepping outside my comfort zone.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nLilliana Sierra: I think it was a conscious choice, but not in the way you might expect. I wasn't just deciding between two paths\u2014I was choosing to believe in myself when I didn't feel like I had the right to. That summer program wasn't just about art; it was about realizing I had the power to shape my own story. I had to make the choice to take that opportunity, even though I was scared. I remember sitting in that classroom, looking at my sketchbook, and thinking, 'What if I don't try? What if I stay in this place where nothing changes?' And I decided I didn't want to stay in that place. I wanted to create something new, even if it meant facing uncertainty. So, I chose to go for it, and that choice set me on a different path\u2014one where I started to see myself as someone who could dream bigger than the life I was born into.\n\n",

The teacher who saw my work and pushed me to apply for that program\u2014she was the kind of person who believed in potential before it was realized. I don't know if I would have taken that step without her. And then there was the local artist who donated supplies; I still remember how nervous I was when I asked for help, thinking maybe I was a bother. But she just smiled and said, 'I was once in your shoes.' That kind of support, even in small ways, can change everything. It reminded me that I wasn't alone in feeling lost, and that there were people who had walked similar paths and still found their way. I think if I had stayed in Miami without that push, I might have just settled into the same cycle my parents were in. But with that help, I saw a different possibility\u2014one where I could use my art to tell stories that mattered, even if I didn't have a lot to start with.\n\n",

My focus has been on finding my own path, especially after leaving the boarding school and coming back to Miami. My parents are still around, though we don't see each other as much as I'd like. They're both working hard, and I know they're proud of me for taking the steps I have, even if they don't always understand the choices I make. I still keep in touch with my mother the most\u2014she's the one who always reminds me where I came from and why I need to keep pushing forward. I have a few cousins who live in the city, and we get together sometimes for family dinners. It's not the same as growing up with a big, close-knit family, but I'm grateful for the people who are still in my life. I think I'll be ready for a relationship when I feel more settled in my career, but for now, I'm just trying to build something for myself that I can be proud of.\n\n",

One of them, Marcus, is actually the one who helped me get my first job at the caf\u00e9. He saw my sketches and thought I should be doing something with my art instead of just waiting tables. We've been friends for years, and even though we're on different paths now\u2014he's studying engineering\u2014he always pushes me to keep going. Then there's my roommate, Sofia, who works at the same caf\u00e9 as me. She's from Cuba, and she's got this amazing way of making everyone feel at home. We talk about everything, from our dreams to our fears, and I think she's one of the few people who really gets where I'm coming from. I don't know what I'd do without her support. There are also a few artists in the community who I look up to, people who've managed to make a living from their work.

My apartment is modest, but it's mine, and I've decorated it with my own artwork\u2014some of the pieces I did during that summer program, and a few I've been working on since. It's not much, but it's a reminder that I'm still creating, still growing.

It's different from the place I grew up in, where the sense of safety was more about survival than community. Here, it's about connection. I think that's why I like it so much.

I started gaining weight, probably from stress and not having the same energy to move around as much. I didn't take it seriously at first, but a few years ago, I got really sick with something that made me take a few weeks off work. It was the first time I really thought about how my lifestyle was affecting me. Since then, I've been trying to take better care of myself\u2014eating more fruits and veggies, even if it's just a banana and some yogurt for breakfast, and trying to move my body more, even if it's just a short walk or a few yoga videos at home.

Those little choices add up, and they remind me that I'm in control of my own well-being. What makes it hard, though, is the stress of trying to balance everything\u2014work, school, helping my grandmother, and still finding time for myself. Sometimes, I feel like I'm running on empty, and that makes it harder to stick to a routine. I also struggle with the guilt of not being able to afford healthier food options or going to the gym regularly. But I'm learning that health isn't just about perfect habits\u2014it's about showing up for yourself, even on the tough days, and doing what you can, even if it's not enough.

It started around the time I was taking on more freelance work and spending long hours hunched over my laptop or sketching. At first, I thought it was just stress, but it got to the point where I couldn't sit for more than an hour without pain radiating down my legs. I finally went to the doctor, and she said it was probably from poor posture and lack of movement over time. I was diagnosed with a mild herniated disc, which was a bit of a shock. It forced me to slow down and take better care of my body, even if it meant missing a few days of work or pushing back on some projects. It was hard, but it also made me realize how much I've been neglecting my health for so long. I started seeing a physical therapist, and I've been doing some exercises to strengthen my core and improve my posture. It's been a slow process, but I'm finally starting to feel better. That experience made me more aware of how my body is connected to everything else in my life\u2014my work, my dreams, my family. I can't keep pushing through pain if I want to keep moving forward, and that's something I need to remember every day.\n\n",

How about you?\n\nLilliana Sierra: The back pain did make things harder, especially with the long hours I spend working on my art and at the caf\u00e9. There were days when I had to cancel shifts or push back on freelance projects because I couldn't sit through a full session without discomfort. It was frustrating because I felt like I was falling behind, and I didn't want to let my health stop me from moving forward. But at the same time, it forced me to slow down and really think about how I was living my life. I realized I was carrying so much on my shoulders\u2014my family, my dreams, my responsibilities\u2014and I wasn't taking time to take care of myself. That pain was a reminder that I can't keep pushing through without breaking. It also made me more aware of how my body is connected to everything else. If I'm not healthy, I can't be there for my grandmother, or for my art, or for the future I'm trying to build. So, even though it was tough, I think it was a necessary pause. It taught me that taking care of myself isn't a luxury\u2014it's a foundation. And now, I'm trying to build that foundation stronger, so I can keep going without falling apart.\n\n",

There's been a lot of growth, but also a lot of uncertainty. I've been working harder on my art, taking those online classes more seriously, and even landing a few small freelance projects, which has been really encouraging. It's given me a sense of purpose I haven't felt in a while. But there are still moments when I feel overwhelmed, especially when I think about how much I have to do and how little time I have. I've been trying to be kinder to myself, though, and I've started setting smaller goals for myself\u2014like finishing a painting a week or dedicating an hour each day to studying. I think the biggest change has been in how I see myself. I used to feel like I was just surviving, but now I feel like I'm actually living, even if it's not always easy.

How about for you?\n\nLilliana Sierra: I think I've struggled with anxiety more than anything else, though I didn't always recognize it for what it was. There were times when I felt like I was constantly on edge, worrying about money, my future, and whether I was making the right choices. I used to feel like I had to be perfect\u2014perfect at art, perfect at work, perfect at taking care of my grandmother. If I messed up, I'd spiral into self-doubt, thinking I wasn't good enough or that I'd end up just like my parents, stuck in the same cycle. It wasn't until I started seeing a therapist that I realized how much of that anxiety was tied to fear\u2014fear of failure, fear of not being enough, fear of not having a plan. Now, I try to acknowledge those feelings without letting them control me. I've started journaling, and sometimes I write down my worries so I can look at them and say, 'Okay, this is real, but it doesn't have to define me.'

He's never been one for words, but I can tell he's trying to be there for me in his own way. And my grandmother\u2014she's the one who keeps everything together. She doesn't let the stress get to her, even when she's worried about her health or the bills. She always says, 'You're not alone, Lilliana. You have us.' That's what keeps me going.

I grew up in a Protestant household, and I remember going to church with my grandmother, who always said that faith was about love and kindness. But as I got older, I started to feel like those words were more about what I was supposed to believe rather than what I actually felt. I don't think I need a religion to feel connected to something greater. For me, that connection comes through art, through the people I love, and through the moments when I feel like I'm part of something that matters.

It's a way for me to stay connected with the creative community, even if I'm not always sure where I'm headed. I follow a lot of local artists, writers, and designers, and sometimes I'll get inspired by their work or even get feedback on my own pieces.

It's not always easy being honest online, but there's something freeing about sharing parts of myself with people who might relate.

I remember a few months ago, when I was going through that really tough time with my back pain and feeling like I wasn't making progress, I posted a few photos of my artwork with captions that were more about frustration than inspiration. To my surprise, a few people reached out\u2014some offered encouragement, others shared their own struggles with chronic pain or creative blocks.

Rent is still the biggest part\u2014$1,200\u2014but then I had to pay for a few additional therapy sessions, some new art supplies I couldn't do without, and a few extra groceries because I was skipping meals more than I should have.

In the summer, for example, the electricity bill tends to be higher because we use the air conditioning more, and I remember last July it was almost $150, which was a bit of a shock.

Besides working at the caf\u00e9, I used to do small freelance illustration gigs through online platforms, mostly for local businesses or independent artists who needed someone to design logos or social media graphics. I also volunteered at a community art space on weekends, helping organize events and teaching kids basic drawing techniques. It was exhausting at times, juggling all of that with my online classes and taking care of my grandmother, but it taught me a lot about time management and what I was willing to sacrifice for my goals. I think that period was really important for me\u2014it showed me that I could be creative and productive even when I didn't have a clear path ahead. It also made me realize that I needed to be more strategic about how I spent my time, which is why I've been trying to focus more on the things that actually matter to my long-term growth.\n\n",

It also made me realize how important it is to have emotional outlets, like journaling or talking to friends and my therapist. I used to think I had to carry everything on my own, but now I see that asking for help is a strength, not a weakness. When it came to discussing my finances, it was humbling to admit how tight things are, but it also gave me a sense of pride in knowing I'm managing to keep things afloat while still working toward my goals. It reminded me that even small savings and careful budgeting matter, and that I'm not just surviving\u2014I'm building something for myself, one step at a time.",

It's not a lot, but it's enough to cover rent, groceries, my grandmother's medications, and a few essentials.

The benefits aren't traditional\u2014there's no health insurance or paid vacation days, but the owners are really supportive in other ways. They let me take time off when I need to, especially when I was dealing with my back pain, and they've been patient with me as I've tried to balance work with my online classes and art projects. What I appreciate most is the sense of community there. The caf\u00e9 is like a little hub for people in the neighborhood\u2014students, artists, musicians, everyone comes in and shares a little piece of themselves. It's not just about making coffee; it's about being part of something that feels alive and real.

The owners of the caf\u00e9, Maria and Carlos, are like family to me. They've been nothing but kind, even when I was struggling with my back pain and had to take extra days off. They never made me feel like I was a burden, which meant a lot when I was already feeling like I wasn't doing enough. As for my coworkers, we all have our own stories, our own reasons for being there, and we've built this kind of unspoken bond. We laugh a lot, we share food, and sometimes we just sit and talk about our lives. I think that's what makes the caf\u00e9 more than just a job\u2014it's a place where I feel seen, even if just for a few hours a day. I don't have a manager in the traditional sense, but Maria is the one who oversees the day-to-day, and she's always checking in on me, making sure I'm okay.
