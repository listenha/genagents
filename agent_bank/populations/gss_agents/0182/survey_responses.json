She also mentioned struggling with stress-related issues and having to learn how to manage them over time. While she has made progress in developing coping strategies like mindfulness and journaling, she has not described herself as consistently relaxed or someone who handles stress effortlessly. This suggests she would not score at the higher end of the scale, but she also wouldn’t score at the lowest end because she has actively worked on improving her emotional resilience.",

However, she has since developed coping strategies like mindfulness, journaling, and seeking support from others. While she acknowledges past struggles with stress, she now views them as part of her journey and has learned to manage them.

She also mentions having close friends like Tasha and coworkers like Marcus, with whom she has meaningful relationships. She is described as someone who is reflective, intentional, and emotionally aware, but not overly expressive or attention-seeking.

            "BFI-10_4": "Jessica has spoken openly about her struggles with stress and anxiety, especially during times when she was juggling multiple responsibilities like work, family, and personal goals. She has also mentioned that she has learned to manage her stress through mindfulness, journaling, and support from friends and family. While she has made progress, she has not described herself as someone who is consistently relaxed or handles stress effortlessly. Her self-reflection suggests she still experiences stress and actively works to manage it, which aligns more with a middle-to-low score on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Jessica Johnson does not mention any artistic interests or activities. Her life story focuses on work, family, community service, and personal growth, but there is no indication that she engages in or values artistic pursuits. She is described as practical, focused on stability, and committed to her role in youth development, which suggests a more utilitarian approach to life rather than one centered on artistic expression.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Jessica describes herself as someone who values relationships and has a strong support system, including close friends like Tasha, coworkers, and family. She also mentions being involved in her community, volunteering, and working with children in after-school programs, which often require social interaction. However, she does not explicitly describe herself as particularly outgoing or sociable, and she has mentioned that she limits her use of social media, which might indicate a preference for more intentional or in-person interactions over large social networks.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Throughout the interview, Jessica consistently demonstrates empathy, understanding, and a strong sense of community. She reflects on her own struggles and those of others with compassion, often emphasizing the importance of support, resilience, and growth. She does not display any tendencies toward judgment or criticism of others, instead focusing on the value of relationships and helping others. This suggests she is unlikely to see herself as someone who tends to find fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Jessica has demonstrated a strong work ethic throughout her life, including her role as a Program Coordinator at Bright Futures, where she manages volunteers, plans activities, and supports children.

            "BFI-10_9": "Jessica has spoken about moments of feeling overwhelmed, especially during her teenage years when she was juggling work, school, and family responsibilities. She also mentioned struggling with stress-related issues in the past, though she has since learned to manage it through mindfulness, therapy, and self-care. While she acknowledges having felt anxious at times, she also emphasizes growth, resilience, and the ability to cope. This suggests she would rate herself somewhere in the middle, but closer to the lower end of the scale, as she has made conscious efforts to manage her anxiety.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Jessica's interview highlights her focus on practicality, responsibility, and community work. She emphasizes her role as a program coordinator, her financial planning, and her commitment to supporting her family and community. While she does reflect on her personal growth and values, her narrative is grounded in real-world challenges and responsibilities rather than abstract or imaginative pursuits. There is no mention of her engaging in creative or imaginative activities, which suggests she may lean more toward the practical end of the spectrum."
