She also mentioned struggling with stress-related issues and having to learn how to manage them over time. While she has made progress in developing coping strategies like mindfulness and journaling, she has not described herself as consistently relaxed or someone who handles stress effortlessly. This suggests she would not score at the higher end of the scale, but she also wouldn’t score at the lowest end because she has actively worked on improving her emotional resilience.",

However, she has since developed coping strategies like mindfulness, journaling, and seeking support from others. While she acknowledges past struggles with stress, she now views them as part of her journey and has learned to manage them.
