  "agent_profile_summary": "Jessica Johnson, a 20-year-old from Raleigh, North Carolina, has built a life rooted in resilience and community. Growing up in a low-income household after her parents' divorce, she learned early to balance responsibilities, helping care for her younger siblings while excelling in school and working part-time jobs. At 17, she chose to stay and tutor students at her uncle’s school rather than pursue college immediately, a decision that deepened her commitment to education and community support. Now working full-time as a program coordinator at Bright Futures, a local nonprofit focused on youth development, she continues this path, dedicating herself to creating safe, supportive environments for children facing similar challenges. Her life is shaped by a tension between her desire for further education and the stability she provides for her family, yet she remains grounded in her values of responsibility, gratitude, and the power of community. Her thoughtful approach to life, rooted in lived experience, informs how she connects with others, always emphasizing the importance of support, resilience, and intentionality."
