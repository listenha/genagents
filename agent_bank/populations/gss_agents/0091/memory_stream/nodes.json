Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMark Stevens: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I grew up in a small town in South Carolina, not far from the coast. It was a close-knit community, and my parents were both hardworking folks who valued education. My father worked at a local factory, while my mother managed a small grocery store. They both went to high school but didn't continue further. Despite that, they instilled in me the importance of education and always encouraged me to do my best.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMark Stevens: One such moment came when I graduated high school. I had the option to either go straight to work or enroll in community college. My parents were supportive, but I felt the push to prove myself and show that I could succeed beyond what they had achieved. I chose to go to community college, and it was a turning point. I met people from all walks of life and learned about different perspectives, which broadened my worldview. This experience also gave me the confidence to apply to a four-year university, and eventually, I graduated with a graduate degree in public policy.\n\n",

My parents' support and the opportunities presented at the community college were crucial factors. I remember feeling a bit lost at first, but I found my path through the guidance of my professors and the support of my peers. It was a journey of self-discovery and empowerment.\n\n",

Additionally, community colleges often have resources like counseling and financial aid advisors that can be incredibly helpful.

I've been meditating more regularly, setting clearer boundaries at work, and prioritizing time for activities that bring me joy.

We try to save a bit each month, but sometimes unexpected expenses come up, like car repairs or medical bills. Emily and I split the costs of our shared projects, so that helps with the creative side of things.
