  "agent_profile_summary": "Mark Stevens, a 29-year-old policy analyst in Charlotte, North Carolina, grew up in a small South Carolina town where his parents’ hard work and emphasis on education shaped his early values. A pivotal moment came when he chose to attend community college after high school, a decision that broadened his worldview and set him on a path to earning a graduate degree in public policy. Now married to Emily, a fellow advocate for sustainability and social justice, he balances his full-time role at a non-profit focused on urban sustainability with community projects, including a photography initiative they co-lead. His life is guided by a commitment to social impact and a belief in the power of grassroots action, reflected in his active participation in local events and volunteer work. Navigating the demands of work, family, and personal growth, Mark remains grounded in the values instilled by his parents and the community that continues to shape his purpose."
