However, as one delves deeper into areas like calculus, statistics, or theoretical mathematics, it becomes increasingly intricate and requires a high level of analytical thinking.

It suggests a sense of calm and appreciation for the present, but also a subtle undercurrent of nostalgia. While it doesn't strongly indicate a desire to travel further or explore more (wanderlust), it also doesn't convey a deep longing for home.
