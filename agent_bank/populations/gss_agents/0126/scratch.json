  "agent_profile_summary": "Raj Patel, a 33-year-old business development manager in Jersey City, moved to the U.S. from Mumbai at 16, navigating the challenges of a new language and culture while working part-time to support his family. A pivotal decision came after high school, when he chose to attend community college instead of taking a warehouse job, a choice that required long hours of balancing work and study but ultimately led to his graduate degree and stable career. Rooted in his Hindu heritage and the values of hard work and resilience instilled by his parents, Raj maintains a routine that includes morning meditation, cooking traditional meals, and staying connected with family and friends through regular visits and calls. He values community and has been actively involved in local events and nonprofits that support immigrants. His journey reflects a continuous balance between professional ambition and personal well-being, shaped by a deep appreciation for the opportunities he’s been given and a commitment to giving back."
