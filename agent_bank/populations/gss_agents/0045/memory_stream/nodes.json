Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMelissa Griffin: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I grew up in a small town in the Midwest called Oakwood, which is part of the East North Central region. My parents were both working-class folks\u2014my father worked at the local factory and only got his high school diploma, while my mother was a teacher at the elementary school. She earned her Bachelor's degree and taught there for over two decades. Our family lived in a modest home on Maple Avenue, which is where I still live now, though the house is a bit larger than when I was younger. Growing up, we always tried to keep a tight budget, so we never had much extra money. However, my parents instilled in me the importance of education and hard work.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMelissa Griffin: There was definitely a moment that stands out. When I was in high school, I faced a decision that felt like a fork in the road. I had the opportunity to take an advanced placement (AP) course in economics, which could have been very beneficial for my future academic and career prospects. However, my parents couldn't afford the extra tuition fees. I remember feeling torn because I knew that taking the course would open doors for me, but I also didn't want to burden my parents further. In the end, I decided to stay in the regular classes. Looking back, I realize that this choice didn't just affect my immediate academic path; it also influenced my perspective on financial responsibility and the value of education. It was a tough call, but I'm glad I stood by my parents during a challenging time.\n\n",

Instead, I felt a strong sense of empathy towards my parents' situation. They had already given me so much, and I didn't want to add to their financial stress. It wasn't just a matter of choosing between two paths; it was about understanding where my parents were coming from and how their sacrifices shaped my values.\n\n",

If someone had guided them through the process, or if there was a local initiative to help students like me, it might have made a difference.

The past two years have included a minor health setback when I broke my ankle, which reminded me of the importance of being prepared for unexpected situations and taking care of my body. This experience reinforced the lessons I learned from my parents about the value of health and wellness. Additionally, the discussions about managing stress and maintaining mental well-being highlighted the importance of mindfulness and staying connected with loved ones. I've found that taking a step back, breathing, and reflecting on gratitude helps me stay grounded during stressful times. Overall, these reflections underscore the enduring impact of my upbringing and the values instilled in me, which continue to guide my daily life and choices.",

I try to allocate money for entertainment and personal hobbies, but sometimes I have to cut back. The recent increase in stress has made me more mindful of my spending, and I've been looking for ways to reduce costs without sacrificing too much.
