She also mentions that she enjoys spending time with her aging parents and participating in community events, which suggests she is not someone who is extremely reserved. However, she does not seem overly outgoing and mentions that she takes time to process her thoughts through mindfulness and journaling, indicating a moderate level of introversion. Given these factors, it's likely that she would fall closer to the middle of the spectrum, but leaning slightly towards a more reserved personality.",

She has described herself as valuing community and giving back, which are more aligned with practical and communal activities rather than artistic ones.

            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Melissa Griffin has a background that emphasizes practicality and hard work, which suggests she may not naturally see herself as someone who engages in a lot of imaginative thinking.
