          "raw_responses": {
            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Kenji described himself as someone who values his relationships with friends and family and maintains a routine that includes social activities like tending to his garden and cooking with friends. He also mentioned that he enjoys face-to-face interactions and prefers them over social media. These descriptions suggest that Kenji is more on the sociable side rather than reserved.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Kenji seems to have a balanced perspective on life, valuing his relationships and family while also facing challenges like work stress. He mentions maintaining a routine and relying on support from his family and friends, which suggests he is trusting of those around him. However, the project he's leading at work and the stress it brings indicate he is also cautious and mindful of potential issues. Given these mixed signals, it seems more likely that he leans towards being trusting, but not excessively so.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Kenji's reflections and descriptions of his disciplined lifestyle, routine, and focus on self-care, it seems unlikely that he would identify as lazy. He mentions maintaining a structured routine, exercising regularly, and actively managing his stress and well-being. His comments on his career and personal life suggest that he values productivity and balance, which contradicts a self-identification as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on Kenji's responses, particularly his acknowledgment that stress from work and life can feel overwhelming at times, but his efforts to manage it through coping strategies like meditation and breaks, it suggests that while he does experience stress, he is able to handle it reasonably well. This indicates a moderate level of stress management and relaxation.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Kenji does not seem to have a strong connection to artistic pursuits. He mentions no specific artistic hobbies or interests, and his primary focus seems to be on his work and maintaining a routine. He also talks about his work and personal life in a straightforward manner without mentioning any artistic components. Therefore, it's reasonable to infer that he would agree with the statement that he has few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Kenji describes himself as having a close group of friends and colleagues who are important to him. He also mentions that he enjoys spending time with friends and colleagues, and he participates in activities like going for walks or grabbing lunch with them. This suggests that Kenji is sociable and enjoys social interactions, which aligns more with the higher end of the range.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Kenji seems to value harmony and balance in his personal and professional life. He has spoken positively about his relationships with family and friends, and has emphasized the importance of support and mindfulness. This suggests he is more likely to see himself as understanding and empathetic rather than critical and fault-finding.",
            "BFI-10_8": "From the interview, Kenji is described as someone who tries to maintain a healthy work-life balance and manages his stress through mindfulness practices like meditation. He also mentions being intentional about his routine and making small adjustments when needed. While he acknowledges that stress from work can be overwhelming at times, his efforts to manage it suggest that he is conscientious about his tasks and tries to ensure they are done properly. This indicates that he is likely to choose a value closer to 5.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Kenji described managing his stress through mindfulness practices like meditation and maintaining a routine. He also mentioned that while he doesn't struggle with severe depression or anxiety, there are times when stress can feel overwhelming. This indicates that he experiences some nervousness or anxiety, but he has coping mechanisms to handle it. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems most appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Kenji is described as a person who enjoys problem-solving, has a structured routine, and maintains a balance between work and personal life. He doesn't mention any strong creative hobbies or frequent use of his imagination in his daily life. While he does engage in mindfulness and meditation, these aren't necessarily related to an active imagination. Therefore, it seems more likely that Kenji would lean towards the lower end of the spectrum."

            "BES-A_1": "Based on the interview, Kenji appears to be a person who values his relationships and maintains strong connections with his family and friends. He mentions staying in touch with his parents, having close friends at work, and appreciating the support of his community. This suggests he is empathetic and supportive, making it more likely he would choose 5.",
            "BES-A_2": "Based on the interview, Kenji appears to be someone who values strong emotional connections and maintains close relationships with friends and family. He mentions that staying connected with his friends is important and that he tries to be open about his feelings. This suggests that he is likely to be empathetic and attuned to his friends' emotions, making it less likely for him to find it hard to know when they are frightened.",
            "BES-A_3": "Based on the interview, Kenji seems to value emotional well-being and has developed coping strategies to manage his own stress. He acknowledges that while he doesn't struggle with severe depression or anxiety, there are times when stress can feel overwhelming. His openness about his feelings and reliance on mindfulness and support from friends suggests he has a good understanding of how others might feel 'down.' This indicates he would be more aligned with the higher end of the scale.",
            "BES-A_4": "Based on the interview, Kenji seems to have a good balance of empathy and awareness. He has described maintaining close relationships with his friends and colleagues, which suggests he is attentive to their emotional states. However, he also mentioned that he doesn't rely heavily on social media for emotional support, indicating he might not be as finely tuned to every nuance as someone who would choose 5. Still, he has described being aware of the stress his friends might be facing, so he is likely closer to the middle to upper end of the scale.",
            "BES-A_5": "From the interview, Kenji described how he values mindfulness and taking care of his well-being, including his ability to manage stress through meditation. His reflective nature and the mention of being intentional about his meditation practice suggest he is tuned into his own emotions and possibly those of others. While not explicitly stated, his openness to emotional support and his focus on balance in his life imply a level of emotional awareness. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that Kenji would lean towards the higher end of the scale.",
            "BES-A_6": "Based on the interview, Kenji seems to be a reflective and thoughtful individual who values his relationships and has a good rapport with his coworkers. He mentions being aware of his own stress levels and practicing mindfulness, which suggests he is attuned to his own emotional state and possibly the emotional states of others. While he doesn't explicitly mention being very good at picking up on others' emotions, his overall demeanor indicates a level of emotional awareness.",
            "BES-A_7": "Based on Kenji's responses, he seems to value his relationships and is described as having close bonds with friends. He also mentions that he tries to be open about his feelings and acknowledges the importance of maintaining strong support systems. This suggests that he is likely to be aware of his friends' emotions and would be able to notice when they are angry quickly.",
            "BES-A_8": "Based on the interview, Kenji values his relationships with his friends and family. He mentions staying connected with them and appreciates the support they provide. This indicates that he is likely more in tune with the feelings of those around him, rather than being completely unaware of them.",
            "BES-A_9": "Based on the interview, Kenji seems to have a strong support system and maintains close relationships with friends and family. He mentions that he has a close group of friends and colleagues who are very important to him, and he enjoys spending time with them. This suggests that he is socially engaged and likely has good social skills. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would choose 5, as he appears to be able to understand and interpret the emotions of his friends. Given his described social interactions, a more likely choice would be a lower number on the scale."

He has developed coping strategies to manage stress and has a positive outlook on his work environment, suggesting he is capable of handling complex problems. However, he acknowledges that the project has been particularly demanding, indicating he finds it challenging but not insurmountable. Given his resilience and adaptability, a score of 3 seems fitting, but since the scale is from 1 to 5, and he leans towards being able to solve problems, a 4 or 5 would be more appropriate.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Kenji appears to have a balanced perspective on his skills. He has a job as a software engineer, which involves problem-solving and logical analysis, but he also acknowledges the challenges of his current project. This suggests he is aware of his limitations in this area but doesn't seem to undervalue his other skills. Therefore, he is likely to choose a moderate score that reflects his honest assessment of his abilities.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Kenji seems to be a moderate individual who balances both analytical and less analytical approaches in his life. He focuses on practical decision-making and values routine and structure, suggesting he is not entirely unanalytical, but also not strongly analytical. His decision to balance work and personal life, as well as his structured approach to meditation and mindfulness, indicate a balanced mindset rather than a strong preference for one extreme over the other.",
            "REI_4": "Based on Kenji's responses, he seems to value practical solutions and has developed coping mechanisms to manage stress and balance his life. He mentioned relying on mindfulness and scheduling breaks, indicating that he does think things through but may not always reason things out to the extreme detail. His openness about the challenges he faces and his reliance on structured routines suggest that he is not entirely impulsive but also not a perfectionist in his decision-making process.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Kenji Yamamoto has been dealing with a demanding project at work, which has required him to develop new coping strategies like meditation and scheduling breaks. While he has been managing stress more effectively, he still mentions that the project can be challenging. This suggests he can handle some pressure but may not be completely unaffected by it. Therefore, it seems more likely that he would lean towards the middle of the scale.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Kenji describes his work as a software engineer and mentions that he enjoys problem-solving and the satisfaction of seeing the products he creates make a positive impact. This suggests he likely has strong logical thinking skills. Additionally, his positive attitude towards meditation and mindfulness indicates he values rational thought and analytical processes. Given these points, it seems more plausible that Kenji would place a higher value on his logical abilities.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Kenji describes himself as someone who enjoys problem-solving and being intentional about his meditation practice. He seems to value his ability to manage stress through logical and methodical approaches.

This suggests he likely appreciates the importance of thoughtful decision-making.

He described his job as a software engineer, which requires logical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, he mentioned using meditation and scheduling breaks as coping strategies, indicating he values systematic and logical methods. His background in computer science and his current career suggest that he is likely to lean towards using logic to solve problems.",
            "REI_10": "Based on Kenji's responses, he seems to be someone who thinks through his decisions and provides explanations for them. He reflects on his past choices and explains how they shaped his life. For example, he discusses how he made a thoughtful decision to attend community college despite financial concerns, and he considers the importance of balancing personal aspirations with family responsibilities. This indicates that he is someone who can clearly articulate the reasons behind his decisions."
