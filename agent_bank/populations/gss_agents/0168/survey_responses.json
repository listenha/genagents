            "BFI-10_1": "Kevin Huang describes himself as someone who has stepped back from a fast-paced corporate life to focus on family and community. He values presence, connection, and meaningful relationships, but he also reflects on his life with introspection and a sense of quiet purpose. He does not appear to be overly expressive or outwardly social, and his lifestyle suggests a preference for thoughtful, deliberate engagement rather than constant social interaction. This aligns more with a reserved personality.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Kevin Huang has demonstrated a strong sense of connection and trust in his relationships, particularly with his family and the people he mentors. He has spoken about the importance of being present for others, showing up for his parents, and supporting those around him. These behaviors suggest a trusting nature. Additionally, he has expressed gratitude for the people in his life and has not indicated any deep-seated skepticism or guardedness.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Kevin Huang describes himself as someone who is actively involved in caring for his parents, managing investments, mentoring others, and engaging in creative pursuits like painting. He has a structured daily routine and takes responsibility for his family and community. He also reflects on his life with intention and purpose, which suggests he does not see himself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Kevin Huang has described experiencing stress, particularly around caring for his parents and the emotional weight of being their main support. He has also mentioned moments of anxiety and feeling overwhelmed, but he has developed coping strategies like mindfulness, journaling, and talking to friends. While he is not entirely relaxed and does struggle with stress at times, he has made conscious efforts to manage it and has found ways to cope effectively. This places him somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale, but not at the highest level of calm and ease.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant mentioned taking up painting again as a recent addition to their life, which shows they have at least some artistic interest. While they don’t describe themselves as deeply engaged in artistic pursuits, they do engage in creative activities, suggesting they would not strongly agree with the statement.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Kevin Huang describes himself as someone who has shifted his life priorities to focus on family and meaningful connections, rather than the fast-paced, social environment of the corporate world. While he has friends and engages in community activities, his lifestyle is more reflective and centered around his parents. He does not appear to seek out large social interactions or frequent social engagement, which suggests a more introverted or reserved personality in terms of sociability.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Kevin Huang demonstrates a strong sense of empathy, compassion, and understanding toward others. He reflects on his own life with gratitude and focuses on the positive aspects of his relationships, particularly with his parents and the people he mentors.

He also reflects deeply on his actions and responsibilities, which suggests he values thoroughness and attention to detail.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Kevin Huang has described moments of anxiety, particularly in the early days after leaving his corporate job and taking on the full responsibility of caring for his parents. However, he has since developed coping strategies like mindfulness, talking to friends, and seeing a therapist. He also emphasizes that while he has experienced stress, he has learned to manage it and not let it define him. This suggests he does not see himself as someone who gets nervous easily, even if he has faced challenging times.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Kevin Huang's life story reflects a focus on practicality, responsibility, and care for his family. While he has engaged in creative activities like painting, his overall narrative emphasizes stability, routine, and emotional presence over imagination or abstract thinking. His life seems more grounded in the tangible and the relational rather than the imaginative or speculative."

            "BES-A_6": "Kevin Huang describes a life centered around family, caregiving, and a slower pace of life. While he mentions staying active through walking, gardening, and other light physical activities, he does not emphasize working out in a formal or structured way. His motivation for activity seems more tied to practical needs (like caring for his parents) than to the mood of others.
