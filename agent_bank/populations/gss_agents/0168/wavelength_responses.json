This aligns more with the idea that history is random, as their dominance and extinction were not part of a linear, progressive path of civilization. Dinosaurs represent a natural, evolutionary event that was not necessarily leading to a 'better' future, but rather a series of random occurrences in the timeline of life. My perspective, shaped by a focus on the unpredictability of life and the importance of presence over progress, leads me to see the clue as more aligned with the 'history is random' end of the spectrum."

However, drinking alone or in a way that seems excessive or inappropriate could lean toward cringe.

On the other hand, the mention of candlelight might symbolize a longing for the familiar, the warmth of home.
