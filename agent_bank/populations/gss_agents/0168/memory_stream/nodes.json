Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nKevin Huang: I was born in Shanghai, China, but I moved to the United States when I was about five years old. My parents wanted better opportunities for my sister and me, so we relocated to the Pacific region, where my father had family connections. I grew up in a small apartment in a bustling neighborhood, and while my parents worked long hours, they always made sure my sister and I had a good education. I remember my father working multiple jobs to support our family, and my mother, though she only had a high school education, was very involved in our lives and always encouraged us to study hard. I went to a public school where I was one of the few Asian students, and I learned English pretty quickly. I always felt a bit out of place culturally, but I was grateful for the opportunities I had. I eventually earned a bachelor's degree in business administration, which helped me land a job in tech, but after a few years, I decided to step back from the corporate world and focus on my family. Now, I live in Palo Alto with my parents, and I help take care of them while also managing some small investments I made over the years. It's not the life I initially imagined, but it's fulfilling in its own way.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nKevin Huang: Yes, there was a defining moment that shaped the rest of my life. It happened when I was about 22, right after I graduated with my bachelor's degree in business administration. I had just landed a job at a tech startup in San Francisco, and things were looking up. I was excited about the future, the potential for growth, the chance to build something meaningful. But then, my father had a heart attack. It was a wake-up call for me. I realized how much I had been focused on my own ambitions and not enough on my family. I had always been the responsible one, the one who made sure my sister and I stayed on track, but I hadn't really considered what it meant to be there for my parents as they aged. After my father recovered, I made a decision. I left the startup and moved back to Palo Alto to care for my parents, who were both getting older and needed more support. It wasn't easy at first\u2014I had to adjust to a slower pace of life, and I missed the excitement of the corporate world. But over time, I found a new kind of fulfillment in being there for them, in helping them navigate their daily lives, and in managing the small investments I had made over the years. That crossroads taught me that success isn't just about career or money\u2014it's about the people you love and the life you choose to build with them.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nKevin Huang: I think it was a conscious choice, but one that felt inevitable once I saw my father lying in that hospital bed. I had always been the one pushing forward, chasing the next goal, but that moment forced me to pause and reflect on what truly mattered. I didn't just decide to leave the job\u2014I felt like I had to. It wasn't just about my parents; it was about realizing that I didn't want to look back years from now and regret not being there for them. I had always believed in hard work and ambition, but that experience taught me that there's a balance. I still work with my investments, but now I do it on my own terms, with more time for my family. I think, in a way, it was both a choice and a turning point\u2014it was something I had to do, but I also had to make the decision to do it.\n\n",

My sister was living in Seattle, and while she was supportive, she was also dealing with her own life and couldn't be there as much as I wanted. My parents had some help from a few neighbors, but nothing that really replaced the kind of care I could provide. I remember talking to a social worker at the hospital who suggested looking into community resources for elderly care, but I felt like those options were more about temporary assistance rather than the kind of long-term support my parents needed. In the end, I realized that while outside help could supplement things, it wasn't going to replace the emotional connection and daily presence I could offer. That's why I made the decision to step back from my career and take on that role. It wasn't easy, but it was the right choice for my family.\n\n",

My sister is still in Seattle, and we stay in touch regularly through calls and visits. While I miss having a partner and children, I've come to terms with the path I've chosen. It's not what I initially envisioned for myself, but I find deep satisfaction in being there for my parents, helping them with their daily needs, and ensuring they're comfortable in their later years. I've also started mentoring a few young people in my community who are navigating similar crossroads in their lives, which gives me a sense of purpose beyond just family.

It wasn't just a decision\u2014it was a realization that family and presence matter more than ambition alone.

My father often talks about their resilience and how they worked tirelessly to support their children during difficult times. While I didn't have a close relationship with them, I feel a deep respect for their sacrifices. On my mother's side, her family is still in Shanghai, and we keep in touch through letters and occasional video calls. My mother's brother, my uncle, is a teacher there, and he's always been a source of support for her. Our relationship is warm but not overly close, as we're separated by distance and cultural differences. Still, I appreciate the connection we have, and I make it a point to visit them whenever I can.

There's Marcus, who I met in college\u2014he was one of the few people who understood the cultural shift I was going through when I first arrived in the U.S. We stayed in touch even after I left the tech world, and he's been a good friend to talk to when I feel like I'm missing out on the fast-paced life I once had. Then there's Priya, a colleague from my time at the startup. She was one of the few who saw the change in me when I decided to leave the job and return to Palo Alto. She didn't try to convince me to stay in the corporate world; instead, she respected my decision and even helped me transition into managing my investments more independently. I also have a small group of friends from my community who share similar values\u2014people who prioritize family, reflection, and a slower pace of life. While I don't see them as often as I'd like, their presence in my life has been a comfort.

It's a mix of older homes and newer developments, with a lot of families and professionals living here. The streets are tree-lined, and there's a strong sense of community. There's a small park nearby where my parents like to sit and watch the kids play, and I often join them there. The area is pretty diverse, with a lot of Asian families, which makes me feel a bit more at home. I've noticed that over the years, the neighborhood has changed a bit\u2014more tech workers moving in, more startups opening up nearby\u2014but there's still a calm, residential feel to it. I like that it's not too fast-paced, which suits my current lifestyle. It's not the same as the busy streets of San Francisco, but I've come to appreciate the peace and quiet. I also enjoy the local coffee shops and bookstores, which remind me of the kind of places I used to visit when I was working in the city.

I've never had any real issues with crime or safety, which is something I appreciate, especially living with my parents. I think it's also because the area has a lot of families and professionals who are more focused on maintaining a stable environment. There are community events throughout the year, like the local farmers' market and holiday festivals, which bring people together and create a sense of belonging.

It gives me the space to be present for my parents, to take things slowly, and to reflect on what matters most.

My mother usually likes to have breakfast ready by 8, so I try to be up by 7 to help her with that.

I've taken it upon myself to keep the yard looking nice, and it's become a kind of meditative practice for me.

However, my father has had a few flare-ups related to his heart condition. Last year, he had a minor episode where he felt chest discomfort and shortness of breath, which required a trip to the hospital for monitoring.

It's been a reminder of how fragile health can be, and it's reinforced my commitment to staying as healthy as I can so I can continue being there for him. I also started seeing a therapist a few months ago, which has been helpful in managing the emotional weight of caring for my parents.

But I'm learning to take it one day at a time, and that's something I'm trying to pass on to my parents as well.\n\n",

There have been moments where I've felt deeply connected to my parents, especially when we sit on the porch in the evenings, watching the sunset or sharing stories from our past. Those moments remind me why I made the choice to be here, and they fill me with a sense of peace. But there are also days when I feel the weight of it all\u2014knowing that my father's health is still a concern, and that my mother, though strong, is getting older and needs more support. I've learned to accept that this life isn't without its challenges, but it's also not without its rewards. I've found a new kind of strength in being present, in showing up for the people I love, and in finding small joys in the everyday.

How about for you?\n\nKevin Huang: I think I've experienced moments of anxiety, especially in the early days after leaving my job and taking on the full responsibility of caring for my parents. There were times when I worried I wasn't doing enough, or that I was making the wrong decisions for them. I also felt a bit isolated at first, since I was stepping away from the fast-paced world I had been part of for so long. But over time, I've learned to manage those feelings through mindfulness, talking to friends, and even seeing a therapist. I don't think I'd call it depression, but there have been days when I felt overwhelmed and questioned whether I was making the right choice. What's helped me the most is reminding myself that I'm not alone in this\u2014my parents are with me, my friends support me, and I've found a sense of purpose in the life I've chosen.

She's always been the strong one, the one who held everything together, but now she needs more support, and I'm learning to be that support for her. My father, though he's had his health struggles, has been more reflective lately. He talks about the past more often, about his own parents, about the sacrifices he made to give my sister and me a better life. It's been humbling to hear him share those stories, and it's made me realize how much he's always put others before himself. My sister, though she's far away, has been a constant source of comfort. She sends care packages, calls regularly, and even visited last summer. It's not the same as having her here, but it's enough to know she's thinking of us. I think, in many ways, this experience has brought us closer as a family. We've had to rely on each other more, and that's something I'm grateful for.

How about you?\n\nKevin Huang: For me, religion or spirituality hasn't been a central part of my life, though I've always respected the role it plays for others. Growing up in Shanghai, I was exposed to traditional Chinese beliefs and practices, but my family never practiced any organized religion. My parents were more focused on hard work, education, and family values, which shaped my worldview more than any spiritual doctrine. When we moved to the U.S., I didn't really explore organized religion, partly because I felt like I was already navigating enough cultural shifts. However, over the years, especially after my father's health issues, I've found myself thinking more about the bigger picture\u2014about legacy, purpose, and what it means to live a meaningful life. I don't follow any specific faith, but I do believe in the importance of connection, whether it's with family, friends, or the world around me. I think of it more as a kind of quiet spirituality, one that's rooted in gratitude and the simple act of being present. It's not something I would call religion, but it's something that helps me make sense of life in my own way.\n\n",

When I was working in the tech industry, I was more plugged in, but after I left the corporate world, I found myself stepping back from those platforms. I think it's partly because my life has become more about presence\u2014being there for my parents, for the people I mentor, and for the small moments that matter. I do keep in touch with a few friends through messaging apps, and I sometimes look up news or articles online, but I don't spend much time scrolling through feeds or engaging with posts.

But I've started setting aside specific times to check in with myself\u2014whether it's a short walk in the morning, a few minutes of meditation, or even just sitting quietly with a cup of tea. I've also found that talking through my feelings with my sister or a close friend helps a lot.

I've also started journaling more consistently, which has been a great way to process my thoughts and emotions.

On a typical month, we usually spend around $3,500 to $3,800. The majority of that goes toward groceries, utilities, and my father's healthcare costs, which include prescriptions, doctor visits, and insurance premiums.

I helped them with the mortgage payments for a while, but now that I'm managing my investments, I've been able to take over the financial responsibilities. It's a bit of a relief to know that we're not renting and that we have a stable place to call home.

In the winter months, our heating costs went up a bit, and we had to budget more for that. Then, in the spring, we had that unexpected roof repair, which was a big hit to our finances. I remember feeling a bit stressed about it at first, but I was able to use some of the savings I had built up from when I was working to cover it. During the summer, we had a few medical bills from my father's check-ups, which added to the expenses. But then, in the fall, things settled a bit more. We had lower utility bills, and I was able to adjust our spending to make up for the earlier costs. I've also noticed that holidays bring their own set of expenses\u2014like buying gifts for my sister or my parents, or even just going out for a meal.

Financially, I've had to adjust to a new rhythm\u2014one that's less about climbing the corporate ladder and more about ensuring stability for my parents, which has required careful budgeting, saving, and sometimes making tough decisions about what to prioritize. I've also come to understand that emotional support doesn't always come from social media or online connections, but from the real, personal relationships I've nurtured over the years. These experiences have taught me that life is not about perfection or control, but about showing up for the people I love, even when it's hard, and finding peace in the small, meaningful moments that make up each day.",

It wasn't a lot\u2014maybe around $3,000 to $3,500\u2014but it was enough to cover our basic needs and some of the unexpected expenses we had. I've learned to be careful with money, especially since I'm the main financial support for my parents now. It's not the kind of income I was used to when I was working full-time, but it's stable enough to keep us afloat. I also have some savings from when I was working in the corporate world, which helps ease the pressure a bit. It's a different kind of financial rhythm, but I'm managing, and I'm grateful for the peace of mind it brings.\n\n",

It's not a place I go to every day, but rather a role I've built around my family and the people I care about. The benefits of this life aren't the same as what I used to get from a corporate job\u2014no health insurance, no paid vacation, no sick days\u2014but I've found my own kind of stability. I've learned to take care of my health through routine, mindfulness, and the support of my loved ones. I also have some savings and investments that provide a sense of financial security, which is something I used to take for granted. The real benefits of this path are the intangible ones\u2014the peace of mind that comes from being present for my parents, the fulfillment of mentoring others, and the quiet joy of living a life that's meaningful to me. It's not perfect, but it's mine, and I'm learning to appreciate it more every day.\n\n",

When I was in the corporate world, my relationships with my manager and coworkers were mostly transactional\u2014based on goals, deadlines, and performance. I had a good relationship with my manager; she was supportive and gave me opportunities to grow, but I always felt like I was working toward something external, something that wasn't necessarily tied to my personal values. My coworkers were friendly, but our interactions were often limited to the tasks at hand. Now, my relationships are more about connection and purpose. The people I mentor, the friends I've kept, and even the neighbors I've come to know in Palo Alto\u2014they're all part of a different kind of network, one that's built on trust, care, and shared experiences. I don't miss the formal structure of corporate relationships, but I do miss the sense of belonging that came with being part of a team. What I have now is more meaningful, even if it's not what I once thought of as 'work.'\n\n",

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nKevin Huang: My work schedule is incredibly flexible, which is one of the things I appreciate most about this life. Unlike the rigid 9-to-5 structure I used to follow, I now have the freedom to shape my days around my parents' needs and my own sense of purpose. Some days I might start early, helping my father with his medication and breakfast, then spend the morning managing my investments or mentoring someone in the community. Other days, I might take it easier, spending the morning in the garden or reading on the porch. There are no set hours, no meetings to attend, no deadlines to meet\u2014just the rhythm of life as it unfolds. That flexibility has been both a gift and a challenge. On one hand, it allows me to be fully present for my parents and the people I care about. On the other hand, it can be hard to define boundaries, to know when to rest and when to push forward. But over time, I've learned to trust that rhythm, to listen to what my body and heart need, and to find peace in the unpredictability of it all.\n\n",

He had a variety of jobs, mostly in the service industry, to support our family. He worked as a cook in a restaurant for a while, then later took on part-time roles in construction and even drove for a delivery company. He was always the one who made sure we had food on the table and a roof over our heads, even when it meant working long hours or taking on multiple jobs at once. My mother, on the other hand, didn't work outside the home for pay while I was growing up. She was a homemaker, and she managed our household with incredible strength and dedication. She always said that she wanted to be there for us, to make sure we had a stable environment to grow up in. Looking back, I realize how much sacrifice they both made for my sister and me. It wasn't easy for them, especially since they didn't have a lot of education or resources, but they always found a way to provide for us. I think that's why I've always valued hard work and responsibility so much\u2014it's something they instilled in me from a young age, and it's part of who I am today.\n\n",

He worked as a cook in a small restaurant in Shanghai, where he would start his day at 4 a.m., preparing meals for the staff and customers before the restaurant opened. He was always meticulous about the food, and I remember the smell of soy sauce and garlic wafting through our apartment in the mornings. Later, when the restaurant closed down, he found work in construction, where he spent long hours on building sites, often coming home with calloused hands and tired eyes. He was always the first to arrive and the last to leave, and he never complained, even when the work was hard. Eventually, he took on driving for a delivery company, which gave him more flexibility, but it still meant long hours and late nights. His most important duties were always about providing for us\u2014making sure we had food, a place to live, and the chance to have a better life than he did. He never asked for much in return, but I know he wanted us to have opportunities he never had. Looking back, I realize how much he sacrificed, and it's one of the reasons I've always valued hard work and responsibility so deeply.\n\n",

It was a modest operation, but it gave him a steady income for a while. When that closed down, he worked for a construction company that was building residential homes in the neighborhood. They didn't have fancy offices or corporate structures\u2014they were just a group of workers who showed up every day and got the job done. Later, when he started driving for the delivery company, he worked for a local logistics firm that handled everything from groceries to small retail orders. He never talked much about the money he made, but I know it wasn't much. What he did was always about making sure we had what we needed. He never complained about the work, even when it was hard or dangerous. I think that's why I've always believed that work isn't just about the paycheck\u2014it's about the effort you put in and the people you support through it.\n\n",

I hope my father's health remains stable, and that my mother continues to find joy in the small things, like tending to the garden or watching the seasons change from our porch.
