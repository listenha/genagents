Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nRebekah Ortiz: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama. My family has been here for generations, so I've always felt a strong connection to the East South Central region. My parents, though not highly educated, worked hard to ensure we had a stable home. My dad worked at a local factory, while my mom was a nurse at a community clinic. They instilled in me the values of hard work and dedication, even if they didn't always have the means to fully express it themselves.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nRebekah Ortiz: One such moment came when I was 18. I had just finished high school and was faced with choosing between attending college and going straight into the workforce. My parents, who were both working-class individuals, wanted me to follow in their footsteps and get a job right away. However, I felt a strong pull towards higher education, even though I wasn't sure how I could afford it. After much debate, I decided to take out student loans and enroll in a community college. It was a tough decision, but looking back, I know it was the right one. It opened up new opportunities and helped shape my political views, which are now strongly aligned with the Democratic party.\n\n",

But ultimately, once I made up my mind, it felt almost inevitable. I knew it was what I needed to do, even if it meant taking on debt. Looking back, I'm glad I took the leap because it changed my perspective and allowed me to pursue my interests and passions.\n\n",

They offered financial aid and resources, but sometimes it felt like an uphill battle. Knowing that there were people and programs out there that could have helped, it makes me appreciate even more the support I received and the opportunities that opened up for me.\n\n",

What were your biggest expenses last month?\n\nRebekah Ortiz: When it comes to budgeting, it's definitely a tightrope. Rent takes up the lion's share, and then there's my student loan payments and groceries. I try to keep my spending on entertainment and dining out to a minimum, but sometimes I splurge on a nice meal out with friends. It's a challenge to balance all these expenses, but I'm managing. I've been trying to cut back on unnecessary expenses and find ways to save, like cooking at home more often.\n\n",

Rent is about $400, student loan payments are around $200, and groceries cost about $300. I try to keep my utilities and internet bills to about $150 each. I spent about $200 on transportation, mostly gas for my car. Then there's about $200 for miscellaneous things like toiletries and small household items. I usually try to save some money each month, but it's a struggle. I've been working on cutting back on discretionary spending, like dining out, to help with the budget.\n\n",
