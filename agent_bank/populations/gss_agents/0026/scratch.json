A pivotal moment came when he chose to leave his studies to work full-time with this organization, aligning his education with his passion for social justice and leading him to pursue a master’s in urban planning. Now, he balances long hours at his job with community outreach, financial literacy workshops, and maintaining ties with his family, who remain a constant source of support. His commitment to equity and collective action shapes how he approaches both his work and personal life, often reflecting on the tension between professional impact and personal well-being, while striving to foster a more just and connected community."
