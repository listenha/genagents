However, he has also mentioned taking steps to manage these feelings, such as therapy, mindfulness practices, and prioritizing self-care. While he acknowledges that stress is a challenge, he doesn't seem to describe himself as someone who is constantly overwhelmed. Therefore, a score of 3 seems most appropriate, but since the range only goes to 5, a 4 or 5 would be more fitting given his efforts to manage stress.",

He has also spoken about recognizing these feelings early and seeking help, indicating that he is aware of his tendency to feel nervous or anxious.
