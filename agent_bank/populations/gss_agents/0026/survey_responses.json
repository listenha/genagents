However, he has also mentioned taking steps to manage these feelings, such as therapy, mindfulness practices, and prioritizing self-care. While he acknowledges that stress is a challenge, he doesn't seem to describe himself as someone who is constantly overwhelmed. Therefore, a score of 3 seems most appropriate, but since the range only goes to 5, a 4 or 5 would be more fitting given his efforts to manage stress.",

He has also spoken about recognizing these feelings early and seeking help, indicating that he is aware of his tendency to feel nervous or anxious.

Therefore, it is more likely that he would choose a number closer to 1 rather than 5.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Gabriel describes himself as a person deeply involved in social justice and community service, which suggests he is focused on real-world problems and practical solutions. While he has a strong passion for his work, there is no indication that he spends much time on purely imaginative pursuits or that he often uses his imagination in his professional life.
