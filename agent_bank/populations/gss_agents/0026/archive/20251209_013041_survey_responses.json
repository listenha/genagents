            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Gabriel is described as someone who is deeply committed to his work and community, often engaging in community service and activism. He also mentions that he finds emotional support and comfort in connecting with others through social media and with his network of friends and colleagues. This suggests he is more sociable and expressive rather than reserved. However, Gabriel also acknowledges periods of stress and anxiety, which might indicate he has moments of introspection and prefers quieter times. Given his active social life and community involvement, it seems more likely that he would lean towards the lower end of the scale, but not to the extreme of a 1.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Gabriel appears to be a person who values community and social responsibility, and is deeply engaged in community service and social justice projects. His values and work suggest that he is likely to trust others and form close relationships easily. He has mentioned that he values the support of his family, colleagues, and friends, indicating a high level of trust in these relationships. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that he would lean towards the higher end of the trust scale.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on the interview transcript, Gabriel Velazquez comes across as someone who is highly motivated and proactive in his work and community involvement. He has described himself as extremely liberal politically and as someone who takes on significant responsibilities in his non-profit work. His commitment to social justice and community service, along with his focus on personal growth and self-improvement, suggests that he sees himself as someone who is not lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Gabriel mentions that he struggles with anxiety and stress, especially during high-pressure periods at work. He has to remind himself to take breaks and prioritize self-care. This indicates that while he does handle stress, it is a significant challenge for him. Therefore, a score of 3 would be appropriate, reflecting that he is not entirely relaxed or stress-free but manages it well with effort.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Gabriel is described as someone deeply involved in social justice and community service, which are practical and often structured activities. He also mentions being a Project Manager at a non-profit organization, which suggests a focus on problem-solving and practical work rather than artistic endeavors. There is no indication in the interview that he has any particular artistic interests or hobbies. Therefore, it is more likely that Gabriel sees himself as someone with few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Gabriel describes himself as someone who works with community groups, collaborates with colleagues, and engages in community service events. He also mentions that he tries to stay connected with friends, colleagues, and community groups.

He also emphasizes the importance of community service and supports others in his network. This suggests that he is more likely to see the positive aspects in people rather than focusing on faults.

He has also talked about recognizing early signs of stress and seeking help through therapy and mindfulness practices. While he acknowledges these challenges, he also describes himself as someone who tries to manage these feelings and maintains a balanced approach to stress. Given this, it seems more likely that Gabriel would fall somewhere in the middle, but leaning slightly towards more frequent nervousness rather than rarely getting nervous.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Gabriel seems to be deeply engaged in his work and community projects, often involving creative problem-solving and innovative approaches. His passion for social justice and community development suggests a level of creativity and imagination in his work.
