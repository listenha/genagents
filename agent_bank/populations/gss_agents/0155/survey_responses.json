            "BFI-10_1": "Ryan Henderson describes himself as someone who is reflective, thoughtful, and emotionally open in his interactions, particularly with his family and close friends. He shares personal struggles, emotions, and vulnerabilities throughout the interview, which suggests a level of openness and expressiveness. While he may not be overly extroverted, he is not reserved in the sense of being quiet or withdrawn. Instead, he engages deeply with others and is willing to share his inner thoughts and feelings.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Ryan Henderson has shown a deep sense of connection and trust in his relationships, particularly with his wife Sarah, his daughter Emily, and the community around him. He describes being present for his family, relying on his wife as his anchor, and feeling a sense of community in South Philly. He also reflects on the importance of relationships and being there for others, which suggests a generally trusting nature.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Ryan Henderson describes himself as someone who is actively working multiple part-time jobs, caring for his daughter, and volunteering in his community. He shows a strong sense of responsibility and commitment to his family and others. He also reflects on his challenges with stress and anxiety but consistently emphasizes his efforts to be present and do what is necessary for his family. This indicates that he does not see himself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Ryan has described experiencing significant stress related to his job search, financial instability, and health concerns. He also mentioned feeling anxious and overwhelmed at times, though he has been making efforts to manage it through small coping strategies like meditation and journaling. While he is not completely overwhelmed, he clearly struggles with stress, which suggests he would not rate himself as a 5. However, he is not entirely unable to handle stress, so a 1 is also unlikely. A score of 2 or 3 seems more accurate, but based on his overall tone and self-awareness, a 2 is the most intuitive choice.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Ryan Henderson mentions having a passion for writing and politics in his early years and even references keeping a journal and writing short pieces about politics or his thoughts on the neighborhood. This suggests he still has some level of engagement with creative or expressive activities, even if not professionally. However, he does not mention any current artistic hobbies or interests, and his focus has shifted more toward family and community work. This places him somewhere in the middle, but closer to the lower end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Ryan Henderson describes himself as someone who values close relationships, particularly with his family and a few close friends. While he mentions having friends from college and community connections, he also reflects on how life has kept him busy with work and family responsibilities. He doesn't emphasize socializing or being the center of attention, and he seems more introspective and focused on family life than on being outgoing or sociable in a broader sense.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Ryan Henderson comes across as someone who is reflective, self-aware, and values relationships. He shows empathy and understanding in his interactions with others, including his family, coworkers, and neighbors. He also acknowledges his own shortcomings and is focused on personal growth and being present for his family. These traits suggest he is more likely to be forgiving and less inclined to find fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Ryan Henderson describes his current work as part-time jobs, including data entry and administrative tasks at a community center. While he is described as responsible and committed to his family and community, he also acknowledges that his work is not glamorous or aligned with his original career goals. He often reflects on his life with a sense of resilience and adaptability, but there is no explicit mention of him being particularly meticulous or detail-oriented in his work. His focus seems more on showing up and doing his best rather than on being exceptionally thorough.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Ryan has openly discussed his struggles with anxiety, particularly in relation to his job search, financial instability, and the pressure of being a father. He mentions feeling overwhelmed, uncertain about his future, and having moments where he feels like he's 'treading water.' These reflections suggest that he does experience nervousness and anxiety, though he has been trying to manage it through coping strategies like journaling and meditation. This places him closer to the lower end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Ryan Henderson mentions a passion for writing and politics during his college years, which suggests some level of imagination or creativity. However, his current life is more focused on practical matters—working part-time jobs, raising a daughter, and managing financial struggles. He doesn't explicitly describe himself as someone with an active imagination, and his narrative leans more toward resilience and responsibility than creativity or imagination."

While he has shown resilience and adaptability, he has also expressed uncertainty about his future and has struggled with anxiety and self-doubt. His reflections suggest a degree of self-awareness about his limitations, particularly in terms of career and financial stability. This aligns with a higher score on the scale, indicating he may feel less confident in his ability to solve complicated problems.",

He shows a high level of self-awareness and analytical thinking, especially when reflecting on his decisions and their consequences.

            "REI_4": "Ryan Henderson demonstrates a thoughtful and reflective nature throughout the interview. He often pauses to consider his decisions, reflects on his life choices, and shows a deep awareness of his emotions and circumstances.

            "REI_5": "Ryan Henderson has described feeling stress and anxiety related to his job search, financial instability, and family responsibilities.

He reflects on his life with introspection and considers the consequences of his decisions, but he also emphasizes emotional factors like love, family, and personal growth.

He seems more intuitive and emotionally driven in his decision-making.",
            "REI_7": "Ryan demonstrates logical thinking in several parts of the interview, such as when he reflects on his career choices, evaluates his financial situation, and considers the impact of his decisions on his family. He also shows a structured approach to his daily routine and responsibilities. However, he also expresses emotional depth and introspection, which suggests he may not see himself as purely logical.

He describes his decisions as being driven by emotional factors, such as love and family, rather than purely logical reasoning.

This suggests he may not rely heavily on logic to solve problems in his life.",
            "REI_10": "Ryan Henderson reflects on his decisions with a great deal of introspection, particularly when discussing major life choices like moving to Chicago or prioritizing his relationship over his career.

            "REI_9": "Ryan Henderson often reflects on his life with emotional depth, acknowledging his struggles with anxiety, uncertainty, and the challenges of balancing family and work. While he shows some logical thinking (e.g., budgeting, planning for the future), his narrative emphasizes emotional resilience, personal relationships, and lived experience over purely logical problem-solving.

            "BFI-10_1": "Ryan Henderson describes himself as someone who is reflective, emotionally open with his wife, and engaged in meaningful conversations during the interview. He shares personal struggles, emotional reflections, and has a deep connection with his family. He is not shy about expressing his feelings or thoughts, even when discussing difficult topics like his career, mental health, and financial struggles. This suggests he is more open and expressive rather than reserved.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Ryan Henderson has shown a deep sense of connection and trust in his relationships, particularly with his wife Sarah, his daughter Emily, and his community. He emphasizes the importance of family, community, and showing up for the people he loves. He also reflects on the value of trust in his life, such as trusting his wife to support him through difficult times and trusting his community to provide a sense of belonging. These reflections suggest that he generally sees people as trustworthy and values trust in relationships.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Ryan Henderson describes himself as actively working multiple part-time jobs, caring for his daughter, volunteering, and maintaining a routine. He shows a strong sense of responsibility and effort in his daily life. He also reflects on his struggles with stress and anxiety but consistently emphasizes his efforts to show up for his family and improve his situation. This suggests he does not see himself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Ryan has openly discussed his struggles with anxiety, stress, and feeling overwhelmed by financial and career challenges. He has described moments of doubt, difficulty coping with uncertainty, and even neglecting his health due to stress. While he has made efforts to manage his stress (like journaling and meditation), he has not portrayed himself as someone who consistently handles stress well or feels relaxed.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Ryan Henderson mentions a passion for writing and politics during his college years, and he still keeps a journal and writes short pieces about politics or his thoughts on the neighborhood. This indicates that he has some artistic or creative interests, even if they are not central to his current life. He does not express a lack of interest in artistic pursuits, so he would likely disagree with the statement that he has few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Ryan Henderson mentions having friends from college and Chicago, and he values friendships, but he also describes his current life as being centered around his family and part-time work. He doesn't emphasize socializing or being outgoing in his daily routine, and he seems more introspective and focused on family and stability. While he has friends, he doesn't describe himself as someone who actively seeks out social situations or enjoys being the center of attention.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Ryan Henderson comes across as reflective, self-aware, and focused on personal growth and relationships. He emphasizes empathy, compassion, and the importance of family and community. He does not exhibit tendencies toward judgment or criticism of others, and instead, he reflects on his own shortcomings and the importance of kindness. This suggests he would not see himself as someone who tends to find fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Ryan Henderson describes his work as part-time jobs in data entry and community center tasks. He acknowledges that these are not ideal or fulfilling roles, and he often reflects on how he is not in the career path he originally envisioned. While he is described as responsible and trying to be present for his family, there is no explicit mention of him being meticulous or thorough in his work. Instead, he seems to focus more on managing his responsibilities and adapting to his circumstances rather than excelling in his current roles.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Throughout the interview, Ryan describes experiencing anxiety, particularly around his job search, financial stability, and the pressures of being a father. He explicitly mentions dealing with mild anxiety and even mentions shingles as a wake-up call related to his stress levels. He also reflects on feeling overwhelmed at times and needing to find coping strategies like meditation and journaling. These statements align more closely with the higher end of the scale, where someone sees themselves as getting nervous easily.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Ryan Henderson reflects on his life with a sense of introspection and creativity, particularly in how he processes his experiences and finds meaning in them. He mentions writing in a journal, thinking about his life's journey, and finding beauty in small, everyday moments. These behaviors suggest a degree of imagination and reflection, though not necessarily in a highly abstract or artistic sense. He doesn't explicitly describe himself as someone with an active imagination, but his reflective and narrative-driven approach to life suggests he is not at the lowest end of the scale either."

            "BES-A_6": "Ryan Henderson describes himself as someone who is focused on family, has experienced significant life challenges, and is often dealing with stress and uncertainty. He has mentioned struggling with anxiety and feeling overwhelmed at times, which suggests he may not be consistently motivated by the cheerfulness of others. His daily routine is centered around responsibilities like caring for his daughter and managing part-time jobs, which may make him less influenced by the mood of others when deciding to work out.",

            "BES-A_8": "Ryan Henderson mentions having close friends like Jake and Priya, and he reflects on the value he places on friendships. He also shows emotional awareness in his interactions with others, including his wife and daughter. This suggests he is generally aware of others' feelings, which aligns with a lower score on this statement.",
            "BES-A_9": "Ryan Henderson describes having close relationships, particularly with his wife Sarah and his daughter Emily. He mentions friends like Jake and Priya, and he reflects on the importance of community and connection. He also shows emotional awareness in his interactions and self-reflection, suggesting he is reasonably in tune with others' emotions. However, he doesn't explicitly mention being able to read his friends' happiness or emotional states. Based on his introspective nature and the depth of his relationships, he might not be extremely skilled at interpreting others' emotions, but he is not entirely unaware either."

While he has shown resilience and adaptability, he has also expressed feelings of uncertainty and frustration about his career path and financial situation. He has not demonstrated a strong sense of confidence in solving complex problems, particularly in the context of his professional life, where he feels he is not where he thought he would be. This suggests he may lean toward feeling less confident in his problem-solving abilities.",
            "REI_2": "Ryan Henderson has demonstrated an ability to reflect deeply on his life, analyze his decisions, and consider the broader implications of his choices. He has shown introspection and logical reasoning in evaluating his career path, family dynamics, and personal growth.

He reflects on his career path, family, and personal growth in a way that emphasizes intuition, feelings, and lived experiences rather than structured analysis.

He reflects deeply on his life decisions, often weighing personal relationships and values alongside practical considerations. While he demonstrates analytical thinking (e.g., reflecting on his financial situation, evaluating his career path), he also shows a strong emotional and intuitive side, especially in his focus on family, personal growth, and meaning. This suggests he is neither extremely logical nor extremely unlogical, but rather somewhere in the middle.",
