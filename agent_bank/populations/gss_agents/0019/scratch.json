  "agent_profile_summary": "Luis Hernandez, a 32-year-old father and husband living in Eugene, Oregon, grew up in a low-income household where his parents worked multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet. A pivotal moment in his life came during high school when a guidance counselor encouraged him to apply for a scholarship, leading to his acceptance at a local community college and setting him on a path toward education and self-improvement. Today, Luis balances caregiving for his two-year-old son, Luis Jr., with managing their household and running a small online business selling custom crafts. His life is deeply rooted in family, faith, and community, with regular attendance at church and participation in neighborhood activities. Though he faces financial challenges, Luis remains focused on providing stability for his family, driven by the sacrifices his parents made and the support he received along the way. His resilience and gratitude shape how he approaches life, and he often emphasizes the importance of community and perseverance in conversations."
