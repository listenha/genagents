            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Rosa describes herself as someone who values her family, friends, and sense of community, but also emphasizes the importance of hobbies and personal growth. Given her emphasis on personal hobbies and her desire for stability and a deeper sense of belonging, it suggests she may not be as outgoing in social settings. Additionally, her focus on resilience and adaptability in facing challenges implies a more introspective and reserved nature.",

This indicates a generally trusting nature, as she relies on others and finds comfort in their presence. Additionally, she has mentioned that she uses social media to seek support and connect with others, which suggests a willingness to trust and engage with her community.

She mentions engaging in hobbies like gardening and cooking to cope with stress, and she has a strong support system. However, she also acknowledges having moments of stress and overwhelm, particularly during the uncertainties brought by the pandemic.

            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Rosa describes herself as someone who enjoys hobbies like gardening and cooking. These activities are creative in nature, involving design, planning, and expression.

            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview transcript, Rosa describes herself as someone who has managed to keep her mental health relatively stable and finds that staying active and connecting with others helps her cope. She mentions that she tries to stay positive and focuses on the things she can control, which suggests she is generally able to manage her nervousness. However, she also acknowledges that she has had moments of stress and overwhelm, indicating that she does experience nervousness, albeit not to a degree that would lead her to see herself as highly prone to nervousness all the time.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Rosa seems to engage in hobbies like gardening and cooking, which can involve some level of creativity and imagination. However, she does not mention having a particularly vivid or active imagination. Given that she describes herself as someone who values routine and stability, it suggests she leans more towards practical and straightforward thinking.

While she doesn't explicitly state that she struggles with complex problems, her focus on maintaining a balanced routine and her efforts to learn new skills suggest a moderate approach to problem-solving. She doesn't seem overly confident in her abilities, but also isn't particularly insecure about them either. Therefore, a score of 3 seems most fitting.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Rosa describes herself as someone who values stability, community, and personal growth. She talks about her hobbies and the importance of her support system, which suggests she values more qualitative aspects of life over abstract problem-solving abilities. While she mentions engaging in online courses to keep her mind active, she doesn't emphasize her logical reasoning skills. Therefore, it seems more likely that she would place herself lower on the scale, indicating that she is not very good at solving problems that require careful logical analysis.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Rosa describes herself as someone who values community, support systems, and hobbies that provide a sense of normalcy and joy. She mentions engaging in activities like gardening and cooking, which are more intuitive and less analytical. Her comments about relying on her support network and focusing on everyday routines suggest she leans towards more intuitive and less analytical thought processes.",
            "REI_4": "Based on the interview, Rosa describes herself as someone who values practicality and finds solace in her routines and hobbies like gardening and cooking. She also mentions relying on her support system and coping mechanisms like staying active, which suggests she might not always reason things out carefully. Her willingness to engage in activities without overthinking and her emphasis on the immediate benefits of those activities indicate a preference for quick, intuitive responses rather than thorough reasoning.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Rosa has experienced significant life changes and challenges, such as her parents' separation and the recent move to a new house. While she has coped well with these changes, the interview does not suggest that she excels at handling stress without some difficulty. Rosa has mentioned feeling stressed and overwhelmed at times, indicating that she may not reason as well under pressure as someone who consistently performs well in high-stress situations.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Rosa Gagnon describes herself as someone who values community, support, and routine, rather than emphasizing her logical reasoning abilities. She talks about her hobbies and family life, indicating a more practical and nurturing approach to life rather than a highly analytical one. There is no indication in the transcript that she considers herself particularly adept at logical reasoning compared to others.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Rosa seems to value practical and routine aspects of life, such as maintaining a clean home and organizing tasks efficiently. She also mentions engaging in hobbies like gardening and cooking, which are more hands-on and less analytical. However, she does mention taking online courses to keep her mind active, indicating a willingness to engage in intellectual pursuits. Given these factors, she is more likely to lean towards a moderate response, but with a slight inclination towards logical thinking due to her educational pursuits and current activities.",
            "REI_8": "Based on the interview, Rosa Gagnon appears to be a practical and resilient individual who values stability and community. While she has faced significant challenges, she has managed to navigate them with a sense of determination and reliance on her support system. Given her emphasis on maintaining a routine and the importance she places on her hobbies and family, it suggests she is capable of thoughtful decision-making. However, she also mentions feeling stressed and overwhelmed at times, which might indicate that she occasionally struggles with complex decisions. Therefore, a score of 4 seems most appropriate, reflecting her general capability but acknowledging her occasional challenges.",
            "REI_9": "Rosa describes herself as someone who values community and relationships, and her hobbies and coping mechanisms (gardening, cooking) suggest a more intuitive and hands-on approach to life. However, her ability to manage household tasks and her current focus on planning and organizing (like moving to a new house) indicate a certain level of logical thinking and problem-solving. Given her balanced view and the importance she places on community and support, it seems she leans towards using logic but not exclusively.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Rosa Gagnon seems to be a reflective and thoughtful individual. She values her family, friends, and community, and she has a practical outlook on life. However, she also acknowledges that life can be unpredictable and that sometimes she relies on her support system and routines to navigate challenges. This suggests that while she likely has clear reasons for her decisions, she may not always be able to articulate them in a systematic, step-by-step manner. Therefore, a score of 4 seems most appropriate, indicating that she has clear reasons for her decisions but may not always be able to explain them in a detailed, methodical way."
