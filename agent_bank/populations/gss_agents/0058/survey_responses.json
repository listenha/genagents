            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Rosa describes herself as someone who values her family, friends, and sense of community, but also emphasizes the importance of hobbies and personal growth. Given her emphasis on personal hobbies and her desire for stability and a deeper sense of belonging, it suggests she may not be as outgoing in social settings. Additionally, her focus on resilience and adaptability in facing challenges implies a more introspective and reserved nature.",

This indicates a generally trusting nature, as she relies on others and finds comfort in their presence. Additionally, she has mentioned that she uses social media to seek support and connect with others, which suggests a willingness to trust and engage with her community.

She mentions engaging in hobbies like gardening and cooking to cope with stress, and she has a strong support system. However, she also acknowledges having moments of stress and overwhelm, particularly during the uncertainties brought by the pandemic.

            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Rosa describes herself as someone who enjoys hobbies like gardening and cooking. These activities are creative in nature, involving design, planning, and expression.

            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview transcript, Rosa describes herself as someone who has managed to keep her mental health relatively stable and finds that staying active and connecting with others helps her cope. She mentions that she tries to stay positive and focuses on the things she can control, which suggests she is generally able to manage her nervousness. However, she also acknowledges that she has had moments of stress and overwhelm, indicating that she does experience nervousness, albeit not to a degree that would lead her to see herself as highly prone to nervousness all the time.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Rosa seems to engage in hobbies like gardening and cooking, which can involve some level of creativity and imagination. However, she does not mention having a particularly vivid or active imagination. Given that she describes herself as someone who values routine and stability, it suggests she leans more towards practical and straightforward thinking.

She also talks about experimenting with new recipes, which shows a level of interest in creative activities.
