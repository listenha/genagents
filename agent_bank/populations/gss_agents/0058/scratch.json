  "agent_profile_summary": "Rosa Gagnon, a 40-year-old resident of Charleston, South Carolina, grew up in a close-knit Italian-American family before her parents’ separation at age sixteen forced her to navigate independence and responsibility at an early age. Now married to John for nearly a decade, she balances homemaking with online learning and community involvement, finding purpose in gardening, cooking, and nurturing relationships that anchor her life. Her decision to prioritize stability and family—evident in her plans to start a family and move to a new home—reflects a deep commitment to creating a secure, loving environment. Her resilience, shaped by past challenges, emerges in her ability to adapt while holding onto traditions, like Italian cuisine, and her active participation in local groups. Rosa approaches life with a practical yet warm outlook, valuing connection, growth, and the quiet strength of everyday routines."
