Based on my experiences, most horror movies fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. They aim to scare but often include elements of suspense, drama, or even humor that prevent them from being 'scared to death.' However, they are also not typically 'bored to death' because they are crafted to engage the viewer emotionally and intellectually. I’ve seen horror movies that were genuinely frightening, but I’ve also seen ones that were forgettable or poorly made. Overall, I think horror movies are more likely to fall closer to the 'scared to death' end of the spectrum, but not at the extreme."
