            "BFI-10_1": "Based on the interview, Stephanie describes herself as a single mother balancing various responsibilities, including her part-time job and caring for her teenage daughter. She seems to value the support from her community and focuses on making informed decisions and prioritizing self-care. These qualities suggest she is thoughtful and introspective, which aligns more with the reserved nature. Additionally, she mentions that she doesn't use social media much and prefers in-person connections, indicating a preference for quieter, more intimate interactions. This behavior is consistent with someone who is more reserved.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on Stephanie's story, she has faced numerous challenges as a single mother, including the stress of balancing her work, caring for her daughter, and dealing with financial constraints. While she has had to be cautious in certain aspects of her life, there are also instances of her showing trust, such as in her relationships with her daughter's teacher and other caregivers. Given her supportive community and her willingness to be there for her daughter, it seems more likely that she leans towards trusting others rather than being overly cautious.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on the interview, Stephanie Meyer appears to be a hardworking individual who manages to juggle a part-time job, raise her teenage daughter, and engage in various community activities. She describes herself as resilient and focused on supporting her daughter's dreams and maintaining her own health. These traits suggest she does not see herself as someone who tends to be lazy. Additionally, her active lifestyle and commitment to self-care strategies indicate a proactive approach to her well-being.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Stephanie has experienced significant stress due to her role as a single mother and supporting her daughter's various activities. She mentions dealing with increased stress levels and the challenges of balancing work and family life. However, she also notes that she has been focusing on her emotional coping strategies and has a support system in place. This suggests she is working on managing her stress, but it hasn't fully alleviated her feelings of stress. Therefore, she is likely to be closer to the middle of the range rather than at the extremes.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Stephanie Meyer has a teenage daughter named Lily who is passionate about art. Stephanie mentions that she tries to support Lily in her art pursuits and attends her art classes. This indicates that Stephanie herself has some interest in art, even if not as deeply as her daughter. Therefore, it is unlikely that she would strongly agree with the statement that she has few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on the interview, Stephanie describes herself as someone who values the love and support from her community and enjoys connecting with others. She mentions that her relationships at work are generally positive and that she has a supportive network. This suggests that she is more extroverted and sociable, aligning her with a higher score on the scale.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on Stephanie's responses, she seems to value forgiveness and support from her community, especially in the context of raising her daughter. She mentions the importance of support and love, and her reflections on her life and challenges indicate a more positive outlook towards others. While she acknowledges challenges, she doesn't mention a tendency to frequently find fault with others. Therefore, it's more likely that she would see herself as someone who rarely finds fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on the interview, Stephanie describes herself as someone who takes care to support her daughter and prioritize her well-being, even in the face of challenges. While she mentions that her days are busy and stressful, she also highlights the importance of self-care and making time for her daughter. This suggests that she is likely to be thorough and detail-oriented, but also acknowledges the constraints of her life. Given her commitment to her daughter and her efforts to balance her responsibilities, it seems more likely that she would choose a higher number on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on Stephanie's description of her life, she has faced numerous challenges, including being a single mother, balancing work and her daughter's activities, and managing her own stress and anxiety. These experiences suggest that she likely feels nervous and anxious at times. However, she has also developed coping mechanisms and supports herself and her daughter, indicating she can handle stressful situations to some extent. Therefore, she is more likely to choose a moderate level of nervousness rather than a very low or very high level.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on Stephanie's background and current lifestyle, it seems unlikely that she would score herself a 1 on this scale. She describes herself as a mother and a book lover, which suggests she enjoys engaging with stories and possibly creating her own narratives. Additionally, she talks about supporting her daughter's artistic pursuits, indicating some level of engagement with creativity. However, the interview doesn't provide strong evidence that she would score a 5 either, as there isn't much detail about her own imaginative activities or creative hobbies. Therefore, a moderate score seems most appropriate."

She also mentions challenges with stress and anxiety, which could make complex problem-solving feel overwhelming. Additionally, her focus on maintaining a manageable budget and balancing her responsibilities suggests she tends to avoid overly complicated situations whenever possible.",
            "REI_2": "Based on Stephanie's interview, she seems to navigate her daily life with a mix of resilience and practicality. She mentions dealing with stress and anxiety, but also focuses on making informed decisions and coping strategies. Given her background and current circumstances, it's unlikely she would score a 5, as that would imply a high level of comfort and proficiency in logical analysis, which isn't reflected in her narrative. However, she doesn't indicate significant difficulties either, suggesting a middle ground. Therefore, a score of 3 seems most fitting, but considering the slightly lower difficulty in her daily life, a 2 or even a 1 could be more appropriate.",
            "REI_3": "Based on Stephanie's description, she appears to be someone who focuses more on practical matters and has a strong sense of family and community. She mentions balancing work, family, and her daughter's activities, which suggests she may not prioritize deep analytical thinking over more immediate concerns. Additionally, her focus on self-care and emotional coping strategies indicates a preference for more intuitive approaches to solving problems. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume she would lean towards the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_4": "Based on Stephanie's description and the interview, she seems to value practical decisions and has made significant life choices based on family values and personal goals. However, she also acknowledges that she sometimes feels overwhelmed by stress and anxiety, which might lead to less careful decision-making. Given her emphasis on the importance of making informed decisions, but also her recognition of the emotional challenges, a moderate score seems fitting. She is not entirely impulsive, but also not overly methodical.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Stephanie has experienced significant stress and anxiety, particularly due to the challenges of being a single mother and supporting her daughter's aspirations.

While she mentions that she has faced challenges and has had to make significant decisions, she also highlights her resilience and the support she receives from her community.

            "REI_7": "While Stephanie Meyer describes herself as a single mother and a part-time employee, there's no specific mention in the interview that highlights her logical or analytical skills. However, her detailed descriptions and organized approach to managing her household and supporting her daughter suggest some level of logical thinking.

However, she also mentions dealing with stress and anxiety, indicating that she might not always rely solely on logic. Given her background and the fact that she has managed to navigate her life challenges, a score of 3 or 4 seems most fitting, but leaning towards a 4 as it indicates a stronger inclination towards logical problem-solving.",
            "REI_10": "Based on Stephanie's interview, she seems to value reflection and has described making conscious and considered decisions, especially when it comes to her life choices like attending community college instead of a private high school. She has also spoken about recognizing the importance of making informed decisions.

While she values the support and love from her community, she seems to have a more pragmatic and perhaps slightly detached approach to understanding the emotions of others.

These factors suggest that she often finds herself under pressure. However, she has also described using coping mechanisms like talking to a therapist and practicing mindfulness, indicating that she is working on improving her ability to handle stress. Given this, it's reasonable to assume that while she may struggle in some high-pressure situations, she is likely not at the extreme end of struggling all the time.",
            "REI_6": "Based on Stephanie's responses, she seems to value her community and the support it provides, rather than emphasizing her own abilities or achievements. While she mentions making informed decisions and valuing self-care, she doesn't explicitly highlight exceptional logical reasoning skills. Given her focus on community and family, it's reasonable to assume she wouldn't rate herself as exceptionally logical compared to others.",
            "REI_7": "Given Stephanie's background and current situation, she seems to value structured approaches and practical solutions. She described making conscious decisions and valuing the support of a community and her therapist, which suggests a logical and methodical mindset. However, she also expressed that she sometimes struggles with stress and anxiety, which might indicate a slightly more intuitive side. Given her overall description, a score of 4 seems most fitting.",
            "REI_8": "Based on the interview, Stephanie Meyer described making conscious and thoughtful decisions, especially when it came to her education and career choices. She emphasized the importance of informed decision-making and stepping out of her comfort zone. This suggests that she values careful thought and deliberation in her decision-making processes.",
            "REI_9": "While Stephanie Meyer has faced numerous challenges in her life, such as being a single mother and managing Lily's increased involvement in after-school activities, she has shown a capacity for resilience and problem-solving. However, she has also expressed feelings of stress and anxiety, indicating that she may not always rely on logical solutions. Given her mention of coping strategies like talking to a therapist and practicing mindfulness, it suggests that while she values logic, she also recognizes the need for alternative methods. Therefore, a moderate score seems fitting.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Stephanie Meyer described making a conscious and informed decision when choosing to attend a community college instead of a private high school. She also reflected on the importance of making informed decisions and stepping out of her comfort zone. This suggests that she values clarity and rationale in her decision-making process. Therefore, she is more likely to choose a higher number on the scale."

While she is not explicitly described as shy or avoiding social situations, she does mention that she prefers in-person connections over online ones and values the support from her community. This suggests she leans slightly towards being reserved but not to an extreme extent.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Given Stephanie's background and current situation, she seems to be a person who has faced challenges and has had to rely on the support of her community. She mentions the importance of support from her community and the love from Lily's teacher and other caregivers. This suggests she has a positive view of people and their intentions. Additionally, her resilience and the way she talks about her community indicates a trusting nature.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Based on Stephanie's description, she is a single mother working part-time and managing her daughter's after-school activities. She emphasizes the importance of balancing work, family, and self-care, which suggests she is actively engaged and motivated. While she mentions stress and challenges, she does not indicate a preference for inactivity or laziness. Instead, she focuses on making informed decisions and seeking support, indicating a proactive approach to her life.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Stephanie has expressed several instances of stress and anxiety, particularly around balancing her job, supporting her daughter's activities, and being a single parent. She has mentioned that stress and anxiety are significant challenges for her and that she has to actively manage them through coping strategies like therapy and mindfulness. Given these factors, it seems unlikely that she would rate herself as a 5, which would imply that she handles stress exceptionally well. However, she does mention using coping mechanisms and trying to stay positive, indicating that she is not entirely at the 1 end of the spectrum. Therefore, a moderate rating of 3 seems more appropriate.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the information provided in the interview, Stephanie Meyer emphasizes her daughter's passion for art and her support for her daughter's dreams. She mentions that Lily is an incredible young woman with a strong passion for art, and they often do activities together, such as art projects. This indicates that Stephanie values and supports her daughter's artistic interests, which suggests she herself likely has some level of interest in art or at least appreciates it. Therefore, it is unlikely that she would strongly agree with the statement that she has few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Based on Stephanie's responses, she describes herself as someone who values community support and enjoys spending time with her daughter and friends. She mentions that her relationships at work are positive and that she's part of a close-knit community. These descriptions suggest that she leans towards being sociable and outgoing rather than introverted.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Stephanie appears to be a resilient and supportive individual who focuses on her daughter's well-being and the support of her community. She describes herself as a single mother who is dedicated to her daughter's growth and dreams, indicating that she is more likely to be understanding and supportive rather than critical of others. She also mentions the importance of seeking help and prioritizing self-care, which suggests she is aware of her own emotional needs and doesn't tend to find fault with others as a default response.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Based on the interview, Stephanie has described herself as someone who tries to prioritize self-care and seeks help when needed. She also mentions that she is committed to staying positive and present for her daughter, which suggests a level of conscientiousness. However, she also acknowledges the stress and challenges of balancing her roles as a single mother and her job. Given these factors, it seems she is capable of being thorough but may sometimes find it challenging due to her busy schedule and the demands of being a single parent.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Stephanie has mentioned dealing with stress and anxiety, especially when balancing her role as a single mother and supporting her daughter's growth. She has talked about focusing on her emotional coping strategies and recognizing the importance of self-care. However, she doesn't seem to indicate that she is constantly nervous or anxious. Therefore, it is more likely that she would choose a number closer to 1, indicating that she is generally calm and composed, but acknowledges that she can experience some nervousness.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on Stephanie's background and current lifestyle, she seems to have a balance between practicality and creativity. While she works part-time and raises a teenage daughter, she also engages in creative activities like gardening and spends time with her daughter pursuing her art. This suggests she has a bit of an imaginative side, but it's not the defining aspect of her personality. Given the information provided, a 3 would be a balanced response, but leaning slightly towards a 4 to reflect her creative tendencies."

She values the love and support from her family and community, and her description of being present for Lily and supporting her dreams indicates a high capacity for understanding and sharing in others' happiness.

            "BES-A_2": "Based on the interview, Stephanie has experienced significant emotional challenges and stressors, such as being a single parent and supporting her daughter's growth and development. These experiences suggest she is likely to be very aware of the emotions of those around her, including her friends. She has also mentioned relying on the support of her community and the love from her daughter, indicating a high level of empathy and attentiveness to the emotional states of others.",
            "BES-A_3": "Given Stephanie's description and the challenges she faces, it's reasonable to infer that she has a deep understanding of the emotions of others, especially those around her like her daughter Lily. Her experiences with stress, anxiety, and the emotional demands of being a single mother suggest she has a rich reservoir of empathy. She mentions that she focuses on her emotional coping strategies and talks to a therapist, indicating a heightened awareness of her own and others' feelings. This aligns more closely with the high end of the empathy spectrum.",
            "BES-A_4": "Based on Stephanie's description, she seems to value empathy and community support, which suggests she would be good at noticing when friends are scared. Additionally, she mentions that the support from her community and Lily's teacher has been invaluable, indicating she is someone who pays attention to the emotional states of those around her. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict she would choose a higher number on this scale.",

She mentions that the love and support from her community and Lily's teacher are invaluable, indicating a high level of empathy and perceptiveness. Additionally, she describes her daughter's emotional growth and her own emotional coping strategies, suggesting she is attuned to the emotional states of others. Therefore, it is likely that she would choose a higher number on this scale.",
            "BES-A_6": "Based on Stephanie's background and the detailed information provided, she appears to be an empathetic and caring individual who has navigated complex family situations and supports her daughter. Given her close relationship with her daughter and her involvement in her daughter's life, it is reasonable to assume she is good at picking up on her emotions. Additionally, her community involvement and support roles suggest she is attentive to the feelings of others. Therefore, she is more likely to choose the higher end of the scale.",
            "BES-A_7": "Based on Stephanie's responses, she seems to be a reasonably empathetic and observant person. She cares deeply about her daughter and has described feeling a strong sense of connection with her community. This suggests that she is likely to be attuned to the emotions of those around her, including friends. Additionally, her role as a single parent and her work at the bookstore, where she interacts with a diverse group of people, indicate that she is accustomed to noticing and responding to the emotional states of others.",
            "BES-A_8": "Based on the interview, Stephanie has a close relationship with her daughter Lily and mentions the support she receives from the community, indicating she is likely attuned to her surroundings and the emotions of those around her. However, the statement specifically refers to friends, not family, and she doesn't explicitly mention being very aware of friends' feelings. Given the context, it seems more plausible that she is not as attuned to friends' emotions compared to her own family members, but she might still be somewhat aware of them. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems most fitting, but since we must choose between 1 and 5, 1 is a better fit as it reflects less awareness of friends' feelings.",
            "BES-A_9": "Based on the interview, Stephanie is a single mother who balances multiple responsibilities, including her job, her daughter's activities, and her own emotional and financial well-being. While she mentions support from her community and Lily's teacher, she doesn't explicitly discuss having a deep understanding of her friends' emotional states. Given her busy life and the focus on her immediate family, it seems she might find it more challenging to fully grasp the happiness of her friends compared to someone with more time and energy to dedicate to social interactions."

She mentions that she has been focusing on her emotional coping strategies, like talking to a therapist and practicing mindfulness, which suggests she is trying to improve her problem-solving skills. However, given that she has not explicitly stated that she excels at solving complex problems, it seems more likely that she would fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, acknowledging her challenges without overstating her abilities.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Stephanie Meyer describes herself as someone who is working part-time, raising a teenage daughter, and dealing with various stressors. She mentions that she has been focusing on her emotional coping strategies and recognizes the importance of seeking help, which suggests a level of self-awareness and willingness to acknowledge her limitations. Given these factors, it is reasonable to assume that she would rate her ability to solve problems requiring careful logical analysis as below average, but not to the lowest extent possible.",
            "REI_3": "Based on Stephanie's interview, she seems to have a balanced view of her abilities. She discusses making informed decisions and stepping out of her comfort zone, which suggests she values analytical thinking to some extent. However, she also emphasizes the importance of emotional support and community, which can be seen as more intuitive approaches. Given her mixed views and the fact that she doesn't explicitly state she is not analytical, it's reasonable to predict a moderate response.",
            "REI_4": "Given Stephanie's description, she seems to have experienced significant life changes and challenges, such as moving from Germany to the US, choosing a community college over a private high school, and raising her daughter alone. These experiences suggest that she has had to make important decisions without always having the luxury of time for extensive reasoning. Additionally, her focus on emotional coping strategies like talking to a therapist and practicing mindfulness indicates that she values emotional intelligence and support over purely logical analysis.

While she mentions that her stress levels have been higher recently due to Lily's increased involvement in after-school activities, she also talks about her emotional coping strategies and the support she receives from her community. This suggests that she has developed some resilience and can handle certain levels of stress. However, the mention of increased stress and anxiety indicates that she may struggle more than she likes to admit, especially in high-pressure situations. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that she would lean towards agreeing but not strongly agreeing with the statement.",
            "REI_6": "Given Stephanie's background and current life circumstances, she seems to value her practical and grounded approach to life rather than being overly analytical or logical. Her focus is more on balancing her family responsibilities, maintaining her health, and supporting her daughter's dreams. While she mentions having a job that involves helping customers find books, which requires some logical thinking, her responses indicate a more practical, down-to-earth mindset rather than an analytical one. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume she would rate herself lower on this scale.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Stephanie Meyer seems to have a balanced approach to life, but she also mentions that she is working part-time at a bookstore and engaging in various community activities. While she appreciates the value of practicality and decision-making, there is no specific indication that she considers herself extremely logical. Given that she is a single mother and manages her life with the support of her community, it suggests a more pragmatic rather than purely logical mindset.",

She describes her choices, such as attending a local community college instead of a private high school, as conscious decisions made after considering practical considerations. This suggests that she values careful thinking and planning. Additionally, she has been proactive in addressing her mental health by seeking therapy and using coping strategies, indicating a level of self-awareness and thoughtful decision-making. Therefore, she is more likely to choose a higher number on this scale.",

While she doesn't explicitly mention using logic as her primary problem-solving tool, her thoughtful and deliberate actions suggest she can use logic effectively. However, she also emphasizes the importance of community support and emotional resilience, indicating she may not rely solely on logic.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Stephanie Meyer seems to have a thoughtful and deliberate approach to decision-making. She described making informed choices, such as choosing to attend a local community college over a private high school, and explained how she considered practical aspects and family values. This suggests she is capable of clearly explaining her decisions. However, she also mentioned feeling stressed and struggling with anxiety at times, which could indicate some uncertainty or difficulty in decision-making under pressure. Given her overall reflective nature and ability to articulate her choices, a 4 or 5 seems more fitting, but considering her occasional struggles, a 4 might be slightly more accurate."

Therefore, it's unlikely she would choose 5.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Stephanie seems to have faced significant challenges as a single mother, including financial strain and the separation from her ex-husband. These experiences might lead her to be more cautious and less trusting of others. However, she has built a strong support network in her community, which suggests she can trust certain individuals.

Stephanie also mentions that Lily's involvement in art classes and activities has brought new challenges but also immense joy and growth. This suggests that Stephanie values and supports art, even if she may not engage in it herself.

            "BES-A_8": "Based on the interview, Stephanie is described as someone who cares deeply about her daughter and her community. She emphasizes the importance of support and connection, indicating that she is likely to be attuned to the emotions of those around her. Given this, it seems unlikely that she would choose 1, as it would contradict her stated values and behaviors.",
            "BES-A_9": "Based on Stephanie's background and current situation, she seems to have a strong connection with her daughter and the community around her. However, she doesn't mention having extensive social networks or deep friendships outside of her immediate family. Given that she relies heavily on her community for support and has a close bond with her daughter, it's reasonable to assume she has some level of empathy and social awareness, but it might not be at the highest level.

However, she also mentions that she has faced significant challenges, such as balancing her job and raising her daughter, and that these challenges have required her to adapt and find solutions. This suggests that while she may not consider herself particularly adept at solving complex problems, she is resourceful and willing to learn and adapt. Therefore, it seems more likely that she would choose a number closer to 1 rather than 5.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Stephanie has faced numerous challenges and has had to make practical decisions, often with limited information. Her background in community college and her current job at a local bookstore suggest a practical and flexible mindset rather than a highly analytical one. Additionally, her focus on emotional coping strategies and self-care indicates a tendency to rely on intuition and support networks rather than solely on logical analysis. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that she would agree more with the statement that she is not very good at solving problems that require careful logical analysis.",

However, she also acknowledges that reasoning things out carefully can be challenging for her, indicating she leans more towards the intuitive side.",
            "REI_5": "Given the interview transcript, Stephanie describes herself as someone who has been dealing with significant emotional and financial pressures, such as being a single mother, managing a part-time job, and supporting her daughter's interests. She mentions experiencing stress and anxiety, and has been focusing on emotional coping strategies like talking to a therapist and practicing mindfulness. This suggests that she is aware of her limitations under pressure and recognizes the importance of seeking help.

However, she also mentions feeling anxious and sometimes overwhelmed by the demands of her life, which suggests she might not always take the time to think things through carefully.
