While he has made progress in learning coping strategies like breathing exercises and setting small goals, he still acknowledges that he has bad days and sometimes feels like he's barely keeping up.

            "BFI-10_9": "Eric has openly discussed his struggles with anxiety, particularly during times of high stress such as balancing school, work, and family responsibilities. He described moments where he felt overwhelmed, frozen, or unable to focus, which aligns with higher levels of nervousness. However, he has also made progress in managing his anxiety through strategies like breathing exercises, journaling, and seeking support, which may temper his self-perception of being easily nervous.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Eric Johnson mentions enjoying reading and learning, which can be linked to imagination. However, he also emphasizes practicality, responsibility, and the importance of hard work and real-world goals. His focus on education, financial stability, and supporting his family suggests a more grounded, practical orientation.
