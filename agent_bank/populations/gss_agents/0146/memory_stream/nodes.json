Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nEric Johnson: I was born in Munich, Germany, but I moved to the United States when I was about five years old. My family settled in Columbia, South Carolina, and I've lived here ever since. Growing up, my parents worked hard to make ends meet. They both had only a high school education, so they took on a lot of manual labor jobs. My mom worked part-time at a local store, and my dad did odd jobs around town. It wasn't easy, but we always had enough to get by. I grew up in a small house on Elm Street, and I remember my childhood being pretty simple\u2014just the basics, no luxuries. I didn't have a lot of money, but I had a strong sense of family and community. I was always the kind of kid who liked to read and learn, even though I didn't have a lot of resources. I graduated high school a few years ago, and now I'm working toward my GED while I'm in community college. I speak a little German from my parents, but I've mostly grown up speaking English. I'm not sure what the future holds yet, but I'm trying to stay focused on my education and see where that takes me.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nEric Johnson: There was one moment that really shaped my path, and it happened when I was about sixteen. I had just finished my junior year of high school, and I was starting to realize that I wasn't going to be able to afford college the way I had always dreamed. My parents were doing their best, but with both of them working low-paying jobs, there wasn't much left over for things like tuition or books. I remember sitting at the kitchen table one night, looking at my report card and thinking about what my future would look like if I didn't go to college. I felt stuck, like I was going to be trapped in the same cycle my parents were in. But then, my mom sat down next to me and said something that stuck with me. She told me, 'You don't have to be rich to be successful, but you do have to be smart about your choices.' That conversation really opened my eyes. I realized that I didn't have to wait for someone else to give me a chance\u2014I could take control of my own future. I started working part-time at a local bookstore to save up for community college, and I also began volunteering at a community center where I helped tutor kids who were struggling in school. That experience gave me a new perspective on education and the power it can have. It also helped me decide that I wanted to go back to school and earn my GED so I could have more options. That moment was a crossroads for me, and I chose to take the path that would give me the best chance to build a better life\u2014not just for myself, but for my family too.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nEric Johnson: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made all at once. It felt more like a series of small decisions that added up over time. At first, I was just trying to survive\u2014getting through high school, working extra hours, helping out at the community center. But as I kept pushing forward, I started to see that each step I took, whether it was studying late at night or saving every dollar I could, was part of a bigger plan. I didn't have a clear roadmap, but I knew I didn't want to end up in the same place my parents were. So I made the choice to take responsibility for my future, even if it meant sacrificing some things in the present. I think that's what my mom meant when she said I had to be smart about my choices. It wasn't just about making the right decision\u2014it was about staying committed to it, no matter how hard it got.\n\n",

When I was sixteen and feeling stuck, I didn't know where to turn. But there were a few people who really helped me out\u2014my high school counselor, Mrs. Thompson, was one of them. She saw the stress I was under and actually sat down with me to talk about my options. She didn't just tell me what I could do; she helped me realize that I had options. She connected me with a local scholarship program for students who were working while in school, and that gave me the chance to get some financial support for community college. Then there was the community center where I volunteered. The director there, Mr. Hayes, saw potential in me and encouraged me to keep pushing forward, even when I felt like I wasn't making progress. He even let me use the center's library for study time after hours. I think people like them made a huge difference in my life, but I also know that I couldn't have done it without my own determination. It was a team effort, but I had to be ready to take the help when it came.\n\n",

She's twelve and still in middle school, and she's actually the one who keeps me grounded. Even though we didn't have a lot growing up, she always believed in me more than I believed in myself sometimes. My parents are still living in the same house on Elm Street, and while things are better now, they're still working hard to make ends meet. My dad recently started doing some freelance handyman work, and my mom got a full-time position at the grocery store, which has helped a bit. I see them every day, and I know that whatever I accomplish, it's because of their sacrifices. I want to make sure I can provide for them in the future, even if it takes longer than I'd like. Right now, I'm focused on finishing my GED and getting into a better program at the community college. I think once I have that under my belt, I'll be able to start looking into more opportunities\u2014maybe even something in business or management. I just hope I can make them proud.\n\n",

He ended up joining the military, and I admire his courage and discipline. Even though our paths have taken us in different directions, we still keep in touch.

It's one of those places where everyone knows each other, and there's a real sense of community. Some of the houses are older, with small yards and simple designs, but there's a charm to it that you don't always find in bigger cities. The street is quiet most of the time, except for the usual sounds of kids playing or the occasional car passing by. There's a local park a few blocks away where I used to hang out with my sister, and it's still a place where people gather for picnics or just to sit and chat. I like that about Columbia\u2014it feels like a place where people take time to care for each other, even if things aren't perfect. I've seen a lot of changes in the neighborhood over the years, but I think the heart of it has stayed the same.

If you're out on Elm Street after dark, you know someone's probably looking out for you. I've never had any real issues, and I think that's because people here tend to take care of each other. My neighbors are mostly older folks who've lived here for decades, and they know everyone's business in a way that's not intrusive\u2014it's more like a protective instinct. I remember when I was younger, I used to worry about walking home from the store at night, but now I don't think twice about it. I guess that's the kind of place this is.

The downside is that opportunities aren't always easy to come by. There aren't a lot of high-paying jobs around here, and sometimes it feels like the same struggles my parents faced are just repeating themselves. But the upside is that this place has taught me resilience. I've seen neighbors help each other through tough times, whether it's fixing a broken fence or just offering a listening ear. I think that kind of support system is something I'll carry with me wherever I go. It's not glamorous, but it's real. I've also learned to appreciate the little things\u2014like the way the sun hits the old oak tree in our front yard or how the community comes together for local events.

It was embarrassing, but it also made me realize how much my stress was taking a toll. I didn't want to let it define me, though. I started setting smaller goals for myself, like just getting through one chapter of my GED book or taking a short walk after work to clear my head. It wasn't much, but it helped me feel more in control. I think the biggest thing I learned is that I can't do everything at once. I have to take it one step at a time, and that's something I'm still working on. But I'm grateful that I didn't let it stop me from moving forward.\n\n",

I've been working harder than ever to finish my GED and keep up with my community college classes, and it's been exhausting, but also rewarding. I think the biggest thing that's changed for me is that I've started to believe in myself more. I used to feel like I was just going through the motions, trying to survive instead of thriving. But now, I see the small victories\u2014like passing a test or finishing a chapter of my GED book without getting overwhelmed. I've also started to feel more connected to my community again.

How about for you?\n\nEric Johnson: I think I've struggled with anxiety more than anything else, especially in the past year. It's not something I used to talk about, but I've come to realize that it's a real part of my life, and it's okay to acknowledge it. There were times when I felt like I was carrying everything on my own, and that weight made it hard to breathe. I used to push through it, thinking that if I just worked harder, I could outlast the stress. But I've learned that ignoring it doesn't make it go away. I've started seeing a counselor, and it's been a big help. She's taught me how to recognize the signs of anxiety before it takes over and how to manage it with things like deep breathing, meditation, and setting realistic goals for myself. I still have bad days, but I'm not as afraid of them anymore. I know now that it's not a weakness to ask for help, and I'm trying to be kinder to myself when I feel overwhelmed. I think the hardest part is still learning how to balance everything without burning out, but I'm getting better at it.

My sister, Lisa, has been my rock\u2014she's the one who reminds me to take a break when I'm overwhelmed and who still believes in me even when I don't believe in myself.

Growing up, my family didn't really practice any particular faith, and I never really felt the need to fill that space with something formal. I think I've always been more of a person who looks for meaning in the everyday\u2014like the way my mom works so hard to provide for us, or how my neighbors look out for each other on Elm Street. I don't have a lot of answers about life's bigger questions, but I do believe in the power of people helping one another, and that feels like something worth holding onto. I guess if I had to describe it, I'd say I'm more of a spiritual person in the sense that I believe in the strength of the human spirit, even when things are hard. It's not about praying to a higher power, but more about finding hope in the little things and trusting that, even when life feels overwhelming, there's still a way forward.\n\n",

I know a lot of people my age are on Facebook or Instagram, but I've never really felt the need to be connected that way. I think it's more because I grew up in a pretty quiet neighborhood where everyone knows each other, so I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. I do use my phone to stay in touch with my friends and family, especially Jamal and Sarah, but I mostly send text messages or call them directly. I've seen how social media can be a double-edged sword\u2014sometimes it's good for staying connected, but other times it can feel like a lot of noise without any real meaning.

I've had moments where I thought about posting something, like when I was dealing with my anxiety or feeling overwhelmed with everything going on, but I never followed through. I guess I just didn't want to expose my struggles to people I didn't know, or maybe I didn't want to feel like I was being judged.

I've been more consistent with my breathing exercises and I've even started journaling more regularly, which helps me process my thoughts before they spiral.

We live in a small two-bedroom apartment on Elm Street, and the rent is about $650 a month. That's a big chunk of our budget, especially since both my parents are still working low-paying jobs. Groceries are another major expense\u2014my mom works at the grocery store, but we still have to buy food for the whole family, and it adds up. We try to buy in bulk and stick to basics to save money. Utilities are also a concern, especially during the hotter months when the air conditioner runs nonstop. We've been trying to cut back on unnecessary things, like eating out or buying new clothes, but it's not always easy. My part-time job at the bookstore helps a little, and I've been saving some of my earnings for my GED and college expenses.

Rent is the biggest chunk, as I mentioned, and then groceries come next. We try to keep our expenses as tight as possible, especially since my parents don't make a lot.

My parents have been working hard to keep up with the payments, and I've been helping out as much as I can with the bills from my part-time job. It's not ideal, but it's what works for us right now.

In the summer, our electricity bill goes up because we use the air conditioner a lot, and that's something we haven't been able to afford much of. We've had to be really careful about turning it off when we're not home or using fans instead. In the winter, heating is a concern too, but we've been lucky that it's not as cold here in Columbia as it is in other parts of the country. Holidays are another thing\u2014around Christmas, we try to keep it simple, but we still have to buy gifts for each other, and that adds a little extra to the budget. I remember last year, my sister wanted a new backpack for school, and even though it wasn't expensive, it felt like a big splurge at the time. Then there's the cost of my GED and college materials, which I've been paying for out of my own earnings. It's not much, but it adds up when you're trying to balance everything.

Talking about my recent changes in stress levels reminded me that I'm not as overwhelmed as I used to be, and that's because I've started taking better care of myself\u2014whether it's through breathing exercises, journaling, or setting smaller goals. It also made me realize how important it is to be open with my family about how I'm feeling, because their support has been a big part of my healing. Discussing my household budget and expenses reminded me of the sacrifices my parents have made and how much I want to make sure I can contribute to our future. I used to feel like I was just surviving, but now I see that I'm making progress, even if it's slow. I'm learning to be kinder to myself and to recognize that asking for help isn't a weakness\u2014it's a sign that I'm growing and trying to do better for myself and for those I love.",

That includes my parents' combined income from their jobs, plus what I earn from working at the bookstore. My dad's freelance work has been a bit inconsistent lately, so we've had to rely more on my mom's full-time position at the grocery store. I also contribute what I can from my part-time job, which helps a little with the bills. It's not a lot, but it's enough to keep us going. I know we're not wealthy, but I'm proud of how we've managed to keep things together, especially with everything I'm trying to accomplish on my own. It's a tight budget, but I'm learning that even small amounts can add up when you're focused on the long-term goal.\n\n",

The Carters, the owners, are really kind and understanding, which makes a big difference when you're juggling school and work. As for benefits, there's not much in the way of health insurance or paid time off\u2014it's just a part-time job with a steady schedule. But what I do get is the flexibility to work around my classes and study time, which is more valuable than any formal benefits. I also really appreciate the respect they give me, even though I'm just a teenager. They trust me to handle responsibilities, and that's something I don't take for granted. It's not a perfect job, but it's given me a sense of purpose and helped me feel like I'm contributing, even in small ways.\n\n",

How are your relationships with your coworkers?)\n\nEric Johnson: My relationships at work are pretty good, actually. The Carters, Mr. and Mrs. Carter, are like second parents to me in a way. They've been nothing but supportive, even when I was still figuring out how to balance everything. I remember the first time I messed up a customer's order, and instead of getting angry, Mrs. Carter just said, 'Everyone starts somewhere, Eric. Just try again.' That kind of patience and understanding has made a big difference for me. As for my coworkers, there are a few regulars who come in every day, and we've developed a friendly rapport. We joke around sometimes, and I think they see me as more than just someone who works the counter\u2014they see me as someone who's trying to make something of himself. I don't have a lot, but I try to bring a positive attitude to work, and I think that shows. It's not a fancy job, but I feel like I belong there, and that matters more than anything.\n\n",

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nEric Johnson: My work schedule is pretty predictable, but it's not always set in stone. The Carters usually let me know my shifts a week in advance, which helps me plan around my classes and study time. I work three days a week, mostly in the afternoons, but sometimes they'll ask me to cover an extra shift if they're short-staffed. What I like about it is that I can usually adjust my hours if I need to, especially if I'm getting ready for a test or if I have to help my dad with something. It's not the kind of job where you have to be there at the exact same time every day, and that flexibility has been a lifesaver for me. I know some people have more rigid schedules, but for me, having a little control over my time is really important, especially when I'm trying to balance so many things at once.\n\n",

I know we're not wealthy, and I don't expect to be overnight, but I also know that we're working toward something better.

He didn't have a single employer; instead, he took on whatever job came his way, whether it was painting a house, fixing a broken fence, or helping someone with plumbing. He was pretty good at it, too. I remember watching him work on a porch one summer, and he had a way of making even the messiest job look like it had a purpose. My mom worked at a local grocery store, which was a more traditional job, but it wasn't always easy. She started as a part-time cashier, and over time, she worked her way up to a full-time position where she managed the produce section. She was really good at what she did\u2014always making sure the fruits and vegetables were fresh, and she knew every customer by name. I think that's what made her job more than just a paycheck for her. It was a way to connect with people, even if it was just for a few minutes. Both of them had jobs that weren't glamorous, but they were important in their own way.
