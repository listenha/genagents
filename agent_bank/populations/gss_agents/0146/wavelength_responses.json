I've also seen how my sister and I can look at the same thing and have completely different reactions.

However, if it were to be associated with excess, peer pressure, or underage drinking, it would definitely fall on the cringe side.

Instead, it feels like a neutral or introspective moment, perhaps appreciating the ambiance of a new city without strong emotional ties to either wanderlust or homesickness.
