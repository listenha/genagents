  "agent_profile_summary": "Eric Johnson, 19, grew up in Munich, Germany, before moving to Columbia, South Carolina, where he has lived since childhood. Raised by parents with only high school educations who worked multiple jobs to make ends meet, Eric has always valued resilience and the power of education. A pivotal moment came at 16, when he realized he would have to take control of his future rather than waiting for opportunities to come to him. He began working part-time, volunteering at a community center, and pursuing his GED, all while balancing family responsibilities. Today, he works at a local bookstore, studies for his GED, and helps his parents with household tasks. His commitment to education and his family drives him, and he carries a quiet determination shaped by his upbringing. Though he struggles with anxiety, he has learned to seek support and manage stress through small, consistent habits. Eric’s journey reflects a steady push toward stability and self-improvement, guided by the belief that hard work and smart choices can build a better life—not just for himself, but for those he loves."
