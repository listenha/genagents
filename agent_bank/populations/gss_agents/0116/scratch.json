  "agent_profile_summary": "Angel Gonzalez, a 20-year-old Miami native of Venezuelan descent, has spent his life in the same South Atlantic neighborhood, shaped by his parents’ modest yet stable upbringing and their emphasis on education and faith. After high school, he chose to take a gap year, working part-time and volunteering at a community center, a decision that led him to pursue social work and community development. Now, he balances part-time work at a local grocery store with volunteering and online courses, driven by a desire to give back to the neighborhood that raised him. His deep commitment to his family, especially his supportive parents and driven older sister, anchors his life, while his growing involvement in community outreach reflects a clear trajectory from uncertainty to purpose. Angel’s thoughtful, grounded approach to life is evident in how he values steady progress, meaningful connections, and the quiet strength of everyday resilience."
