            "BFI-10_1": "Angela describes herself as someone who has been reflective, thoughtful, and at times introspective, especially during challenging periods in her life. She mentions being a quiet child who loved reading and writing, and she often reflects on her experiences with deep emotional awareness. While she is clearly engaged with others—particularly her son, friends, and community—she also shows a tendency to internalize her emotions and process them privately, as seen in her journaling and meditation practices. This suggests she is more reserved than outgoing.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Angela has shared a life marked by resilience and support from her mother, friends, and community. She has expressed trust in people who have helped her, such as her mother, friends like Maria, and her mentor Mr. Thompson.

She has worked hard to overcome significant challenges, including financial hardship, single parenthood, and health issues.

Her actions and reflections suggest she does not see herself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Angela has spoken openly about her struggles with anxiety, hypothyroidism, and the stress of being a single mother. While she has developed coping strategies like meditation, journaling, and relying on her support network, she also acknowledges that there are days when she feels overwhelmed and stressed. She does not describe herself as consistently relaxed or someone who handles stress effortlessly, which suggests she would not rate herself a 5. However, she has made progress in managing her stress, which might lead her to rate herself higher than a 1.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Angela mentions that she loves reading and writing, and she even started a writing group for single parents. She also encourages her son to read and write, and she has a personal connection to storytelling. These details suggest she has a strong interest in creative and artistic activities, which would place her closer to the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Angela describes herself as someone who values close relationships and has a strong support system, including friends like Maria, Mr. Thompson, and Aisha. However, she also emphasizes her role as a single mother and the importance of her routines, which suggests she may not be highly extroverted. She prefers meaningful connections over large social events and often reflects on her personal life rather than seeking out social stimulation.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Based on the interview, Angela Williams comes across as reflective, empathetic, and focused on growth and support for others. She discusses her own struggles with anxiety and health, and she emphasizes the importance of asking for help, being kind, and showing up for her son. She also talks about the support she has received from her mother, friends, and community. These traits suggest she is more likely to be understanding and less prone to finding fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Angela has shown a strong commitment to her responsibilities, especially as a single mother and content writer. She takes her work seriously, meets deadlines, and reflects on her progress and areas for improvement. She also emphasizes the importance of doing things right, such as her decision to pursue education and her efforts to provide stability for her son. These traits align with someone who sees themselves as thorough.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Angela has discussed her struggles with anxiety, particularly in the early years after her divorce and while raising her son alone. She described feeling overwhelmed and stressed at times, though she has developed coping strategies like meditation, therapy, and leaning on her support system. While she has made progress, she still acknowledges that anxiety is part of her experience, especially during challenging times. This suggests she would likely rate herself somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale, but not the extreme end of 5.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Angela Williams has shown a strong connection to storytelling, both in her own life and in her work as a content writer. She often reflects on her past, shares personal stories, and encourages her son to engage with stories and creativity. Additionally, she started a writing group for single parents and teaches her son to write short stories, which indicates a deep appreciation for imagination and creative expression."

While she has grown more confident over time, she still values quiet moments, like reading to her son or meditating, and she is mindful of her emotional state. She also mentions not being overly expressive on social media and preferring real, meaningful connections over virtual ones. These traits suggest a more reserved personality.",

While she has a strong support system, including her mother and friends, she also reflects on moments where she felt isolated or had to rely on herself. She mentions not always reaching out for help when she needed it, which suggests some level of caution or wariness in trusting others. However, she also has a deep appreciation for the people who supported her, indicating a capacity for trust. Her score is likely somewhere in the middle, reflecting both her resilience and her cautious nature.",

She has described days when she felt overwhelmed and even considered herself to be 'drowning in responsibilities.' However, she has also shown growth in learning to manage stress through meditation, journaling, and seeking support from friends and family. While she is not entirely relaxed or stress-free, she has made progress in handling stress better than she did in the past.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Angela Williams mentions that she loves reading and writing, which are artistic activities. She also encourages her son to read and write, and she even started a writing group for single parents.

Therefore, she is more likely to identify with the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Angela describes herself as someone who values close relationships and has a strong support system, including friends like Maria, Mr. Thompson, and Aisha. However, she also emphasizes her role as a single mother and the need to balance her time between work, Elijah, and personal well-being.

            "BFI-10_9": "Angela has spoken openly about her struggles with anxiety, particularly in the early years after her divorce and while raising her son alone. She also mentioned hypothyroidism and how it affected her energy and emotional state. While she has made progress in managing her anxiety through therapy, meditation, and support systems, she still acknowledges that she has had days where she felt overwhelmed. This suggests she would likely rate herself somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale, but not at the extreme of 5.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Angela Williams frequently mentions her love for reading, writing, and storytelling, which are all closely tied to imagination. She also encourages her son to read and write, showing that she values creativity and imaginative thinking.
