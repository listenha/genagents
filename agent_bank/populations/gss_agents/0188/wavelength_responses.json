From my perspective, a typical horror movie falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. While it might be scary enough to create some tension or jump scares, it's not so intense that it leaves me 'scared to death.' At the same time, it's not so dull that it feels 'bored to death.' I've seen horror movies that were engaging and suspenseful, but they didn't reach the level of overwhelming fear. I think a good horror movie balances fear with entertainment, and I would place it around the middle of the spectrum."

However, if it's done in a way that feels forced, excessive, or leads to embarrassment, it can be cringe.
