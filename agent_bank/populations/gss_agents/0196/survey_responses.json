She mentions having a close-knit group of friends and being content with her life, but she also prefers face-to-face interactions over social media and seems to value solitude and reflection. She is not described as shy or withdrawn, but she also doesn’t actively seek out large social gatherings or attention. This suggests a moderate level of reserve.",

She mentions that she used to push through stress without taking care of herself but has since learned to manage it through mindfulness and self-care.

            "BFI-10_5": "Stephanie's interview does not mention any artistic interests or engagement with creative activities. Her focus is on research, policy work, and community involvement, which are more analytical and practical in nature.

However, she also emphasized that she has learned to manage her anxiety through mindfulness, therapy, and self-care. She does not describe herself as someone who gets nervous easily, but rather as someone who has learned to cope with it over time. This suggests she would not rate herself as a 5, but she also doesn't see herself as entirely free of nervousness, so she might not choose 1 either.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Stephanie Wilson describes herself as someone who is focused on her career, particularly in research and policy, and emphasizes structure, routine, and practical goals. While she reflects on her life and values meaning and connection, there is no explicit mention of her engaging in imaginative or creative thinking as a defining trait.

            "REI_1": "Stephanie Wilson is a researcher with a graduate degree and has been working in the field of sustainable development and environmental policy for five years. She has taken on complex projects, such as analyzing data, writing reports, and influencing policy. She has also demonstrated problem-solving skills by navigating her health challenges and making intentional lifestyle changes. This suggests she has confidence in her ability to handle complicated problems.",
            "REI_2": "Stephanie describes herself as a researcher focused on sustainable development, which involves analyzing data and developing policies. This suggests she regularly engages in logical analysis as part of her work. She also mentions being detail-oriented and making decisions based on careful thought, such as when she applied for the research assistant position. These traits align with someone who is comfortable with logical analysis, making a low score on this statement more likely.",
            "REI_3": "The participant describes herself as a researcher focused on sustainable development, with a background in public policy and a graduate degree. She frequently discusses analyzing data, writing reports, and making policy recommendations, all of which require analytical thinking. Her job and education suggest she is comfortable with and likely values analytical processes.",
            "REI_4": "Stephanie demonstrates a thoughtful and reflective nature throughout the interview. She carefully considers her decisions, reflects on her life choices, and evaluates her health, work, and personal relationships with depth. She also shows a clear ability to analyze her experiences and make intentional choices, such as incorporating mindfulness and setting boundaries at work. This suggests she is capable of reasoning things out carefully.",
            "REI_5": "Stephanie describes herself as someone who has faced significant challenges, including health issues and demanding work, yet she has learned to manage stress through mindfulness, journaling, and setting boundaries. While she acknowledges moments of doubt and stress, she also shows resilience and the ability to adapt. She has taken on complex projects, made important life decisions, and navigated difficult situations with determination. This suggests she is generally capable of reasoning under pressure, even if she sometimes feels overwhelmed.",
            "REI_6": "Stephanie's interview suggests she is reflective, values purpose, and is grounded in community and personal values. While she is detail-oriented and analytical in her work as a researcher, she also emphasizes emotional intelligence, mindfulness, and personal connections. She does not explicitly describe herself as particularly logical or analytical compared to others, and instead highlights her growth, empathy, and balance in life.",
            "REI_7": "Stephanie demonstrates a strong ability to analyze data, think critically, and make decisions based on evidence in her role as a researcher focused on sustainable development. She frequently engages in structured reasoning, such as analyzing reports, interpreting data, and developing policy recommendations. While she is also reflective and values emotional well-being, her professional identity is deeply rooted in logical and analytical thinking.",
            "REI_8": "Stephanie demonstrates a thoughtful and reflective nature throughout the interview. She often pauses to consider her choices, reflects on her decisions, and shows a deep awareness of her actions and their consequences. She also discusses how she has learned to be more intentional with her time, health, and work, which suggests a tendency to think things through carefully. Her introspective tone and deliberate self-evaluation support the idea that she aligns with the higher end of the scale.",
            "REI_9": "Stephanie demonstrates a strong analytical mindset through her career as a researcher focused on sustainable development and environmental policy. She often uses data analysis, reports, and policy evaluation in her work, which suggests she relies on logical reasoning. Additionally, she reflects on her decisions and evaluates outcomes, which aligns with a logical approach to problem-solving. However, she also shows emotional awareness and self-reflection, which might slightly lower her score, but not enough to move her away from the higher end of the scale.",
            "REI_10": "Stephanie reflects extensively on her decisions, such as her career path, health choices, and personal priorities. She often explains her reasoning in detail, such as why she chose to apply for the research assistant position, how she balances work and self-care, and why she values mindfulness and journaling. She also considers the impact of her actions and is reflective about her life choices, which suggests she has clear, explainable reasons for her decisions."
