She mentions having a close-knit group of friends and being content with her life, but she also prefers face-to-face interactions over social media and seems to value solitude and reflection. She is not described as shy or withdrawn, but she also doesn’t actively seek out large social gatherings or attention. This suggests a moderate level of reserve.",

She mentions that she used to push through stress without taking care of herself but has since learned to manage it through mindfulness and self-care.

            "BFI-10_5": "Stephanie's interview does not mention any artistic interests or engagement with creative activities. Her focus is on research, policy work, and community involvement, which are more analytical and practical in nature.

However, she also emphasized that she has learned to manage her anxiety through mindfulness, therapy, and self-care. She does not describe herself as someone who gets nervous easily, but rather as someone who has learned to cope with it over time. This suggests she would not rate herself as a 5, but she also doesn't see herself as entirely free of nervousness, so she might not choose 1 either.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Stephanie Wilson describes herself as someone who is focused on her career, particularly in research and policy, and emphasizes structure, routine, and practical goals. While she reflects on her life and values meaning and connection, there is no explicit mention of her engaging in imaginative or creative thinking as a defining trait.
