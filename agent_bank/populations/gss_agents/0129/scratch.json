  "agent_profile_summary": "Mia Bennett, an 18-year-old from Little Rock, Arkansas, grew up in a working-class household where her parents’ resilience and sacrifices shaped her values. After high school, she chose to stay in her hometown to support her mother during a health crisis, forgoing a scholarship opportunity in graphic design—a decision that underscored her commitment to family. Now working part-time at a local café, she balances caregiving with part-time work and self-directed learning, often volunteering at a food bank and taking online courses. Her life is defined by a quiet determination to build a stable future while staying rooted in the community that raised her. Mia’s growth trajectory reflects a tension between her desire for personal advancement and her deep sense of responsibility to those she loves, a balance she navigates with practicality and a quiet hope for gradual progress."
