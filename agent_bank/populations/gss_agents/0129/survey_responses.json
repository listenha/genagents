            "BFI-10_1": "Mia describes herself as someone who values close, personal relationships and has a strong sense of community and family. While she is reflective and thoughtful, she also engages with others in meaningful ways, such as through her job, volunteering, and friendships. However, she doesn't seem to actively seek out social attention or express herself in a highly outward manner. Her introspective nature and tendency to reflect on her emotions suggest a more reserved disposition.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Mia has expressed a strong sense of community, trust in her neighbors, and reliance on her family and friends. She mentions that people in her neighborhood look out for each other, and she feels safe and supported by those around her. She also describes her coworkers at the café as a 'little family,' indicating a high level of trust in her relationships. These signs suggest that she is generally trusting of others.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Mia describes herself as someone who has made conscious choices to take responsibility, support her family, and work toward her goals, even when it was difficult. She has taken steps like running in the morning, journaling, and taking online classes, showing initiative and self-discipline. She also reflects on her past decisions with a sense of agency and determination, which suggests she does not see herself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Mia has described experiencing anxiety and stress, particularly when balancing her responsibilities at work, caring for her mother, and her own future. She has also mentioned moments of feeling overwhelmed and even collapsing from stress. However, she has been working on coping strategies like journaling, running, and talking to a counselor, which suggests some progress in managing her stress. While she is not completely relaxed or stress-free, she is actively trying to handle stress better, which places her somewhere in the middle of the range.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Mia mentions a brief interest in graphic design and taking an online class in it, which suggests some level of engagement with artistic interests. However, she does not describe herself as deeply involved in or passionate about artistic pursuits. Her focus has been more on practical matters like family, work, and education, which points toward a lower level of self-identification with artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Mia describes herself as close to her family and a few friends, and she mentions having a small but meaningful social circle. She works at a café where she interacts with regulars and coworkers, but she also emphasizes her comfort in her neighborhood and her preference for face-to-face interactions over social media. She does not describe herself as particularly outgoing or sociable in a broad sense, but rather as someone who values close, meaningful relationships over large social circles.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Mia Bennett comes across as someone who is reflective, kind, and focused on her own growth and the well-being of her family and community. She discusses her challenges with honesty but also emphasizes her gratitude for the people in her life and her efforts to be supportive and understanding. There is no indication in the interview that she tends to find fault with others or is critical of them. In fact, she often highlights the support she receives from others and shows a strong sense of empathy and resilience.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Mia describes her work at the café as steady and reliable, and she takes pride in the small but meaningful aspects of her job. She also shows a commitment to her personal growth, such as taking online classes and setting small goals for herself. While she doesn't describe herself as overly detail-oriented or perfectionistic, she does show a consistent effort to do her best and take care of her responsibilities. This suggests she would rate herself somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale, but not at the highest level of thoroughness.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Mia has described experiencing anxiety, particularly when balancing work, family responsibilities, and her own future. She has mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times and has had to learn coping strategies like journaling and deep breathing to manage her emotions. This suggests she does experience nervousness or anxiety, though she is actively working to manage it. She does not appear to be someone who is consistently calm and unbothered, which points toward a score higher than 1.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Mia describes her life in a very practical and grounded way, focusing on her responsibilities, family, and daily routines. While she does reflect on her past and future, she does not express a strong inclination toward creative or imaginative thinking. Her narrative is more about resilience, family, and survival than about creativity or imagination."

            "REI_9": "Mia often reflects on her decisions with emotional weight and personal context, such as when she chose to stay with her family over a scholarship opportunity. While she is thoughtful and reflective, her decisions seem to be guided more by emotional and relational considerations than by a strict logical analysis. She also mentions learning from her experiences and adapting over time, which suggests a more intuitive or experiential approach to problem-solving rather than a purely logical one.",
            "REI_10": "Mia frequently reflects on her decisions, especially during the interview when she discusses her choice to stay with her family after high school. She describes the decision as conscious and deliberate, weighing options and considering the impact on her family. She also talks about setting small goals and making intentional choices, such as taking online classes and starting a morning routine.

            "BFI-10_1": "Mia describes herself as someone who values close, meaningful relationships with her family and friends, but she also mentions that she prefers face-to-face interactions over social media and is more introspective, such as through journaling. She reflects deeply on her life and decisions, and while she is open with people she trusts, she does not seem to seek the spotlight or express herself in a very outward or attention-seeking way. This suggests she is more reserved than outgoing.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Mia has described a life filled with support from her family, friends, and coworkers. She values the people in her life and has expressed gratitude for their presence and support. She has also mentioned feeling safe in her neighborhood and trusting the people around her, such as the neighbors who helped her during her mother's illness. These experiences suggest that she has a generally trusting nature.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Mia describes herself as someone who is working part-time, helping her mother with health issues, taking online classes, and making small but consistent efforts to improve her life. She shows initiative, responsibility, and a strong work ethic, which contradicts the idea of being lazy. Her actions and reflections suggest she is motivated and determined, even if her progress is slow.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Mia has described experiencing stress and anxiety, particularly when balancing work, family responsibilities, and her own well-being. She has mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times and has had to learn coping strategies like journaling, running, and seeking counseling. While she has made progress in managing her stress, she has not described herself as someone who is naturally relaxed or consistently handles stress well. Her self-perception seems more aligned with someone who is still learning to manage stress rather than someone who is inherently relaxed.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Mia mentioned she was interested in graphic design and even considered a scholarship program for it, though she chose to stay with her family instead. She also mentioned taking online graphic design classes recently, which shows she has some interest in artistic fields. However, she does not currently engage in artistic activities regularly or identify as someone with strong artistic interests. Her self-perception seems more aligned with having a few artistic interests rather than many.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Mia describes herself as someone who has a close-knit group of friends and values the relationships she has with her family, coworkers, and neighbors. While she is not overly focused on social media or large social events, she is clearly sociable in her own way, particularly within her local community and at her workplace. She engages with people regularly, has a strong support system, and enjoys meaningful interactions. However, she does not describe herself as someone who actively seeks out new social situations or is particularly outgoing in a traditional sense.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Mia Bennett comes across as someone who is reflective, kind, and focused on her own growth and the well-being of her family and friends. She emphasizes her own struggles, acknowledges her imperfections, and shows empathy toward others, including her parents, neighbors, and coworkers. She does not express any tendency to judge or find fault with others, and instead focuses on her own journey and the support she receives from those around her.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Mia describes her work at the café as steady and predictable, and she emphasizes the importance of routine and showing up for her job. She also reflects on her life with a sense of responsibility and determination, even when things are difficult. While she doesn't explicitly mention being meticulous or detail-oriented, her focus on small, consistent steps and her ability to adapt and manage her responsibilities suggest she values thoroughness in her work.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Mia has described experiencing anxiety, particularly when balancing work, family responsibilities, and her own future. She has mentioned moments of feeling overwhelmed and has sought support through counseling and coping strategies like journaling and deep breathing. While she has learned to manage her anxiety, she has not described herself as someone who is consistently calm or unbothered. Her self-awareness of her anxiety suggests she would rate herself somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Mia Bennett describes her life in a very grounded, realistic way. She reflects on her past, current challenges, and future hopes in a practical manner, focusing on her responsibilities, family, and daily routines. She does not mention engaging in creative or imaginative activities, nor does she describe herself as someone who often engages in fantasy or abstract thinking. Her narrative is rooted in real-life experiences and practical decisions, suggesting she may not see herself as having an active imagination."

While she has faced difficult decisions, such as choosing to stay with her family over a scholarship, she has also shown resilience and a willingness to learn. She has taken online classes and set small goals for herself, indicating a capacity to work through complex situations, even if not always with confidence.

            "REI_3": "Mia describes herself as someone who reflects on her life, makes deliberate decisions, and engages in self-reflection through journaling and thoughtful conversations. While she is introspective and values emotional and personal experiences, she also shows a capacity for structured thinking, such as tracking her budget, planning her day, and considering future goals. However, she does not emphasize logical or analytical reasoning as a key part of her identity, and her responses are more reflective and emotional in tone.",
            "REI_4": "Mia demonstrates careful reasoning throughout the interview. She reflects on her decisions, weighs pros and cons, and considers the long-term impacts of her choices, such as when she decided to stay with her family instead of taking the scholarship.

            "REI_5": "Mia describes moments of stress and anxiety in her life, particularly when balancing work, family responsibilities, and her own well-being.
