            "BFI-10_1": "Mia describes herself as someone who values close, personal relationships and has a strong sense of community and family. While she is reflective and thoughtful, she also engages with others in meaningful ways, such as through her job, volunteering, and friendships. However, she doesn't seem to actively seek out social attention or express herself in a highly outward manner. Her introspective nature and tendency to reflect on her emotions suggest a more reserved disposition.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Mia has expressed a strong sense of community, trust in her neighbors, and reliance on her family and friends. She mentions that people in her neighborhood look out for each other, and she feels safe and supported by those around her. She also describes her coworkers at the café as a 'little family,' indicating a high level of trust in her relationships. These signs suggest that she is generally trusting of others.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Mia describes herself as someone who has made conscious choices to take responsibility, support her family, and work toward her goals, even when it was difficult. She has taken steps like running in the morning, journaling, and taking online classes, showing initiative and self-discipline. She also reflects on her past decisions with a sense of agency and determination, which suggests she does not see herself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Mia has described experiencing anxiety and stress, particularly when balancing her responsibilities at work, caring for her mother, and her own future. She has also mentioned moments of feeling overwhelmed and even collapsing from stress. However, she has been working on coping strategies like journaling, running, and talking to a counselor, which suggests some progress in managing her stress. While she is not completely relaxed or stress-free, she is actively trying to handle stress better, which places her somewhere in the middle of the range.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Mia mentions a brief interest in graphic design and taking an online class in it, which suggests some level of engagement with artistic interests. However, she does not describe herself as deeply involved in or passionate about artistic pursuits. Her focus has been more on practical matters like family, work, and education, which points toward a lower level of self-identification with artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Mia describes herself as close to her family and a few friends, and she mentions having a small but meaningful social circle. She works at a café where she interacts with regulars and coworkers, but she also emphasizes her comfort in her neighborhood and her preference for face-to-face interactions over social media. She does not describe herself as particularly outgoing or sociable in a broad sense, but rather as someone who values close, meaningful relationships over large social circles.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Mia Bennett comes across as someone who is reflective, kind, and focused on her own growth and the well-being of her family and community. She discusses her challenges with honesty but also emphasizes her gratitude for the people in her life and her efforts to be supportive and understanding. There is no indication in the interview that she tends to find fault with others or is critical of them. In fact, she often highlights the support she receives from others and shows a strong sense of empathy and resilience.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Mia describes her work at the café as steady and reliable, and she takes pride in the small but meaningful aspects of her job. She also shows a commitment to her personal growth, such as taking online classes and setting small goals for herself. While she doesn't describe herself as overly detail-oriented or perfectionistic, she does show a consistent effort to do her best and take care of her responsibilities. This suggests she would rate herself somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale, but not at the highest level of thoroughness.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Mia has described experiencing anxiety, particularly when balancing work, family responsibilities, and her own future. She has mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times and has had to learn coping strategies like journaling and deep breathing to manage her emotions. This suggests she does experience nervousness or anxiety, though she is actively working to manage it. She does not appear to be someone who is consistently calm and unbothered, which points toward a score higher than 1.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Mia describes her life in a very practical and grounded way, focusing on her responsibilities, family, and daily routines. While she does reflect on her past and future, she does not express a strong inclination toward creative or imaginative thinking. Her narrative is more about resilience, family, and survival than about creativity or imagination."

While she does not explicitly highlight logical reasoning as her strongest skill, her thoughtful approach to life, such as setting small goals, tracking expenses, and planning for the future, suggests she has a reasonable ability to think through problems methodically. However, she also emphasizes emotional and relational factors in her decisions, which may indicate she does not see herself as exceptionally strong in purely logical reasoning.",

She has described her neighborhood as a place where people look out for each other and has relied on her coworkers and friends for support.

She has described feeling overwhelmed and even collapsing from exhaustion, indicating that she does not always handle stress well. While she has made progress in developing coping strategies, such as journaling and running, she still acknowledges the emotional weight she carries and the difficulty of maintaining balance. This suggests she would not rate herself highly on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Mia mentioned her interest in graphic design and even considered pursuing it, though she ultimately chose to stay in her hometown to care for her mother. She also described her current job at a café, where she interacts with customers and has a creative space in her routine, like journaling and exploring new things. While she doesn't engage in formal artistic pursuits, she does show an interest in creative fields and self-expression through writing and small creative routines.

She mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times and having to learn coping strategies like journaling and deep breathing. While she has made progress in managing her anxiety, she still acknowledges that it creeps in, especially during challenging periods. This suggests she would not rate herself as completely calm or unbothered (1), but also not at the extreme end of being constantly nervous (5). Her self-awareness and efforts to manage her anxiety suggest a moderate level of nervousness.",

While she hasn't explicitly mentioned logical analysis, her ability to balance multiple responsibilities and make thoughtful choices suggests she has some capacity for logical reasoning. However, she may not view herself as particularly strong in this area, especially if she hasn't had formal training in it.",
            "REI_3": "Mia's interview reflects a more intuitive and practical approach to life. She often speaks about her decisions in terms of emotional and relational factors (e.g., staying with her family, valuing community and support systems), rather than detailed analysis or long-term strategic planning. She also describes her life in terms of small, steady steps and emotional coping strategies, which aligns more with a non-analytical thinking style.",
            "REI_4": "Mia demonstrates a thoughtful and reflective nature throughout the interview. She carefully considers her decisions, such as choosing to stay with her family over a scholarship, and reflects on her emotions, financial situation, and future goals with depth. She also shows an ability to analyze her life experiences and make intentional choices, which suggests she does reason things out carefully.",
            "REI_5": "Mia describes moments of stress, such as when she collapsed at work due to overexertion, and acknowledges that she has learned to manage her anxiety and stress through coping strategies like journaling, running, and setting boundaries. However, she also reflects on times when she felt overwhelmed and pushed herself too hard, suggesting she may not always reason well under pressure. Her response indicates she is aware of her limitations in high-stress situations, but has made progress in managing them.",
            "REI_6": "Mia describes herself as someone who reflects deeply on her decisions, often weighing options and considering the impact on her family. While she shows thoughtful and strategic thinking, especially in balancing her responsibilities, she does not emphasize logical reasoning as her primary strength. Her decision-making seems more intuitive, rooted in emotional and relational considerations rather than a strong focus on logical analysis. She also acknowledges her own limitations and the importance of small, gradual steps rather than grand, logical planning.",
            "REI_7": "Mia describes herself as someone who reflects deeply on her choices, sets goals, and makes deliberate decisions, such as choosing to stay with her family over a scholarship opportunity. She also engages in self-reflection, journaling, and planning for the future, which suggests she uses logical reasoning to navigate her life. However, she also emphasizes emotional and relational aspects, such as family and community, which may temper her logical approach. Still, her thoughtful and goal-oriented nature leans toward a moderate to high score on this scale.",
            "REI_8": "Mia frequently reflects on her decisions, weighing options and considering the impact of her choices, such as when she decided to stay in Little Rock instead of taking the scholarship. She also mentions journaling, setting small goals, and learning from her experiences, all of which indicate a tendency to think carefully through her actions and life decisions.",
            "REI_9": "Mia often reflects on her decisions with emotional weight and personal responsibility, such as her choice to stay with her family instead of taking a scholarship. While she does show some self-awareness and planning (like tracking expenses and setting small goals), her decision-making seems more guided by emotional and relational factors than strict logic. She also describes her coping strategies as emotional (journaling, talking to others) rather than purely logical. This suggests she may not rely heavily on logic for problem-solving.",
            "REI_10": "Mia frequently reflects on her decisions, especially the crossroads after high school, and explains them in detail during the interview. She discusses the conscious choices she made, weighing options, and setting goals for herself. This indicates she often has clear, explainable reasons for her decisions."

            "BFI-10_1": "Mia Bennett describes herself as someone who is grounded, values close relationships, and is reflective. She is thoughtful in her decisions and often takes time to process her emotions, as seen in her journaling habit and her cautious approach to major life choices. While she is not shy or withdrawn, she is not overly expressive or attention-seeking either. She prefers the comfort of her small community and values quiet determination over being the center of attention.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Mia has described a life filled with support from her family, friends, and coworkers. She values the people in her life and has spoken about the trust and connection she feels in her neighborhood and workplace. She also reflects on the support she has received from people like her parents, friends, and coworkers, which suggests a general sense of trust in others.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Mia describes herself as someone who is working part-time, taking online courses, volunteering, and caring for her mother. She consistently shows initiative and responsibility in her life, even when facing challenges. She has set goals for herself, like going back to school, and she reflects on her progress and growth. This suggests she does not see herself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Mia has described experiencing anxiety and stress, particularly when balancing work, caregiving, and personal goals. She has also mentioned moments of feeling overwhelmed and needing to rely on coping strategies like journaling, running, and counseling. While she has made progress in managing her stress, she has not portrayed herself as someone who consistently feels relaxed or handles stress effortlessly. Her self-awareness of her struggles with stress suggests she would not rate herself highly on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Mia mentioned she had a scholarship opportunity in graphic design but chose to stay with her family instead. While she shows some interest in design, she hasn’t pursued it actively. She also didn’t mention engaging in other artistic hobbies or expressing interest in them. Her focus has been more on caregiving, work, and practical life steps rather than creative or artistic pursuits.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Mia describes herself as someone who values close relationships and has a strong support system of family and friends. However, she also mentions that she prefers face-to-face interactions over social media and is content with her small, familiar community. While she is sociable with her immediate circle, she does not appear to be highly outgoing or seek out large social settings. This suggests she would likely rate herself closer to the lower end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Throughout the interview, Mia consistently portrays herself as someone who is supportive, understanding, and focused on her family and community. She emphasizes her willingness to help others, her gratitude for the people in her life, and her ability to reflect on her own shortcomings. There is no indication that she tends to find fault with others; instead, she seems to focus on her own growth and the well-being of those around her.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Mia has described her life as one of balancing responsibilities, caring for her mother, working part-time, and managing her own personal growth. While she is diligent in her tasks, such as running in the mornings, journaling, and managing her household, she also acknowledges that she has struggled with stress and burnout. She does not describe herself as someone who is consistently meticulous or detail-oriented in her work or personal life, but rather someone who is trying her best with the resources she has.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Mia has described experiencing anxiety, especially during times of high stress such as balancing work, caregiving, and personal goals. She mentioned struggling with stress and anxiety, even acknowledging that she has learned coping strategies to manage it. However, she also noted that she still has days when anxiety creeps in. This suggests she would likely rate herself somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale, but not the extreme end (5).",
            "BFI-10_10": "Mia's life story reflects a practical, grounded approach to life. She focuses on her responsibilities, such as caring for her mother, working part-time, and managing her household. While she mentions moments of reflection and journaling, there is no indication of a strong inclination toward imaginative or creative pursuits. Her narrative emphasizes stability, resilience, and real-world problem-solving over fantasy or creative exploration."

She reflects on her own emotional struggles, acknowledges the challenges her family has faced, and consistently shows understanding of others' experiences, such as her coworkers, friends, and neighbors.

            "REI_1": "Mia has described herself as someone who has made conscious, thoughtful decisions in her life, such as choosing to stay with her family over a scholarship opportunity. She has also shown resilience and adaptability, balancing caregiving, work, and self-improvement. While she has faced challenges and has not always had the resources to pursue her goals, she has demonstrated problem-solving skills in managing her family's needs, financial constraints, and health issues. However, she also acknowledges her limitations and has expressed feelings of uncertainty about her future, which may suggest a moderate level of self-perceived problem-solving ability.",
            "REI_2": "Mia demonstrates a practical, grounded approach to life, often relying on routine, small steps, and emotional resilience. She acknowledges her limitations and focuses on managing what she can control, rather than engaging in complex logical analysis. While she is thoughtful and reflective, she does not describe herself as someone who excels in highly analytical or structured problem-solving tasks. Her responses suggest a more intuitive, experience-based approach to decision-making.",
            "REI_3": "Mia describes herself as someone who reflects deeply on her life, makes decisions based on personal values and emotional considerations (like choosing to stay with her family over a scholarship), and relies on small, consistent actions rather than large, calculated plans. She also emphasizes emotional coping strategies, personal connections, and intuitive decisions (e.g., staying grounded in her community). These traits align more with someone who is not a very analytical thinker.",
            "REI_4": "Mia demonstrates thoughtful reflection throughout the interview, such as when she discusses her decision to stay in Little Rock after high school, weighing the pros and cons of leaving for a scholarship. She also reflects on her health, financial situation, and future goals with a level of consideration that suggests she does reason things out carefully. This indicates she would likely disagree with the statement.",
            "REI_5": "Mia describes herself as someone who has made conscious, thoughtful decisions in high-stakes moments, such as choosing to stay with her family instead of taking a scholarship opportunity. She also mentions learning to manage stress, set boundaries, and reflect on her choices. These traits suggest she is capable of reasoning well under pressure, even if she has faced challenges in the past.",
            "REI_6": "Mia describes herself as someone who makes decisions based on personal values, family responsibilities, and emotional considerations. She reflects on her choices with introspection and emotional awareness, rather than emphasizing logical analysis. She also acknowledges the complexity of her life and the trade-offs she makes, which suggests a more intuitive or holistic approach to decision-making rather than a purely logical one.",
            "REI_7": "Mia describes herself as someone who makes decisions based on a balance of responsibility, family, and personal goals. While she shows practicality and determination, she doesn't emphasize logical reasoning as a defining trait. Her decisions seem more intuitive and emotionally driven, such as choosing to stay with her family over a scholarship opportunity. This suggests she may not strongly identify with having a 'logical mind' as the highest trait.",
            "REI_8": "Mia frequently reflects on her decisions, weighing options and considering the impact on her family and future. She describes making conscious choices, such as staying in her hometown instead of taking a scholarship, and has engaged in self-reflection through journaling and therapy.

            "REI_9": "Mia often reflects on her decisions with emotional and relational considerations, such as putting her family first, making conscious choices based on personal values, and acknowledging the importance of support systems. While she does show some analytical thinking (e.g., tracking expenses, setting small goals), her narrative emphasizes emotional resilience, intuition, and the importance of community over strict logic. This suggests she may not rely heavily on logic alone when making decisions.",
            "REI_10": "Mia frequently reflects on her decisions, such as choosing to stay with her family instead of taking a scholarship opportunity, and she clearly explains the reasons behind her choices. She often discusses her values, responsibilities, and the impact of her decisions on others. This indicates she is thoughtful and intentional in her decision-making process."

While she is introspective and thoughtful, she also engages with others in meaningful ways, such as through her job and community activities. However, she does not actively seek out large social interactions or appear to be overly expressive in public settings. Her personality seems more reflective and cautious, which aligns more with a lower score on the reserved scale.",

She has also expressed deep trust in her family, especially her parents, and has relied on them through difficult times.

She is actively involved in her community, sets small goals for herself, and shows a consistent effort to improve her life despite challenges. These behaviors indicate that she does not see herself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Mia has described experiencing stress, anxiety, and moments of feeling overwhelmed, especially when balancing caregiving for her mother, work, and personal goals. She has also mentioned learning to cope with stress through journaling, running, and counseling, but she still acknowledges that she struggles with it at times. This suggests she does not fully identify with the '5' end of the range, but she also doesn't see herself as someone who is completely overwhelmed, aligning more with a middle range.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Mia mentioned her interest in graphic design and even considered pursuing it before choosing to stay in Little Rock to support her mother. She also described taking online courses in graphic design and expressed a desire to explore this field further. This indicates she has some artistic interests, though not necessarily a strong or central identity around them. She would likely rate herself as having more than 'few' artistic interests, but not at the highest end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Mia describes herself as someone who values close relationships with family and friends, and she mentions having a few close friends and coworkers she considers important. However, she also emphasizes her routine, her focus on family, and her introspective habits like journaling and running. She does not express a strong desire for large social interactions or a need to be the center of attention, suggesting she may lean more toward the introverted end of the spectrum.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Mia Bennett demonstrates a strong sense of empathy, responsibility, and compassion throughout the interview. She frequently emphasizes her commitment to family, her gratitude for the support she receives, and her focus on personal growth and resilience. She does not express any tendency to criticize or find fault with others, and instead, she highlights the importance of community, support, and understanding. Her self-perception is grounded in humility and a focus on helping others rather than judging them.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Mia has described her work at the café as steady and reliable, and she values the routine and structure it provides. She also mentions taking online classes and setting small goals for herself, which suggests she is detail-oriented and committed to doing things well. While she doesn't have a high-paying or high-status job, she consistently shows up and does her best, which aligns with seeing herself as someone who does a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Mia has described experiencing anxiety, especially when balancing work, caregiving, and her own future. She mentioned struggling with stress and even collapsing at work due to overexertion, which indicates she does feel nervous or overwhelmed at times. However, she also shows resilience and has developed coping strategies, which suggests she doesn’t see herself as someone who gets nervous easily in the most extreme sense. Her response likely falls in the middle of the range, but leaning toward the lower end because she has made progress in managing her anxiety.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Mia describes her life as practical, rooted in her community, and focused on caregiving, part-time work, and self-directed learning. While she reflects on her past and future, her narrative emphasizes real-world responsibilities, stability, and routine.

            "REI_1": "Mia has described her life as one of balancing responsibilities, making practical decisions, and learning gradually. While she has faced challenges, she has shown resilience and adaptability, often finding ways to move forward with small steps. She also mentioned taking online courses and learning new skills, which suggests some level of comfort with problem-solving. However, she has not described herself as someone who excels at solving complex problems, and she often emphasizes the importance of support from others. This suggests she may lean toward the middle or higher end of the scale, but not the extreme.",
            "REI_2": "Mia has described herself as someone who balances caregiving, part-time work, and self-directed learning. She has shown resilience, adaptability, and a practical approach to life, but there is no explicit mention of her comfort with logical analysis or problem-solving. However, she has taken steps to improve her skills (e.g., online courses in graphic design), which suggests some level of analytical thinking. Still, she does not seem to emphasize logical analysis as a strength, and her life seems more rooted in practicality and emotional support rather than abstract reasoning.",
            "REI_3": "Mia describes herself as someone who reflects deeply on her emotions, values, and relationships, and she often makes decisions based on personal connections and intuition (e.g., choosing to stay with her family over a scholarship opportunity). She does not emphasize logical or analytical reasoning in her decision-making process. Her narrative is more introspective and grounded in emotional and relational experiences rather than structured analysis.",
            "REI_4": "Mia demonstrates thoughtful reflection throughout the interview, often considering her choices, weighing pros and cons, and reflecting on her decisions with emotional and practical awareness. She also shows a clear understanding of her situation, her values, and her goals, which suggests she does engage in careful reasoning. This aligns more with a higher score on the scale.",
            "REI_5": "Mia describes moments of stress and anxiety, particularly when balancing work, caregiving, and personal goals. She acknowledges feeling overwhelmed and has had to learn coping strategies like journaling and deep breathing. These reflections suggest she may struggle with reasoning under pressure, though she has developed ways to manage it.",
            "REI_6": "Mia describes herself as someone who makes decisions based on practicality, responsibility, and emotional considerations, such as choosing to stay with her family over a scholarship opportunity. While she is thoughtful and determined, she does not emphasize logical reasoning as a core strength. Her reflections are more intuitive and emotionally grounded, suggesting she may not see herself as particularly strong in logical reasoning compared to others.",
            "REI_7": "Mia describes herself as someone who is practical, grounded, and focused on the present. While she is thoughtful and reflective, her narrative emphasizes emotional and relational aspects of her life, such as family, community, and personal growth, rather than logical or analytical reasoning. She doesn't mention problem-solving in a structured or analytical way, and her decisions seem to be driven more by emotional and practical considerations than abstract logic.",
            "REI_8": "Mia demonstrates careful thought in her decisions, such as choosing to stay with her family over a scholarship opportunity, weighing the pros and cons of her choices, and reflecting deeply on her life during the interview. She also shows a tendency to plan, set goals, and think about the long-term implications of her actions, such as saving money and considering her future education. These behaviors suggest she is someone who thinks things through carefully.",
            "REI_9": "Mia often reflects on her decisions with a sense of emotional weight and personal responsibility, especially when it comes to family and caregiving. While she shows some self-awareness and intentionality in her choices, she also emphasizes emotional and relational factors over purely logical reasoning. She describes her decisions as being influenced by her values, family, and community, rather than a strict logical analysis of outcomes.",
            "REI_10": "Mia reflects deeply on her decisions, especially the crossroads after high school, and often explains her choices with clarity and intention. She discusses how she weighed her options, considered her family’s needs, and made deliberate choices to balance responsibility with her personal goals. This suggests she is thoughtful and reflective in her decision-making process."
