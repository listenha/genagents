            "BFI-10_1": "Joshua Lawson describes himself as a quiet kid who was more interested in reading and spending time with friends than in sports or typical teenage activities. He also mentions that he was reflective and thoughtful, and that he tends to let experiences guide him rather than force decisions. This suggests a more reserved nature. Additionally, he doesn't seem to seek the spotlight or express himself in overly assertive ways, which aligns with a lower score on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Joshua Lawson shows a strong sense of community, empathy, and connection with others, particularly the youth in his neighborhood. He describes working closely with kids, volunteering, and being involved in local activism, which suggests he is open to trusting others and believing in their potential. He also emphasizes the importance of relationships and support systems, which aligns with a trusting personality.",

He is described as intentional, purpose-driven, and committed to helping others. He also acknowledges his own need for self-care and balance, but there is no indication of laziness or avoidance of effort.",

He acknowledges moments of feeling overwhelmed and has had to learn coping strategies like mindfulness and setting boundaries. However, he also shows growth in managing his stress and has made intentional efforts to prioritize self-care. While he is not completely free of stress, he is actively working on handling it better, which suggests a middle to upper-middle score.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Joshua mentions that he is involved in community work, volunteering, and activism, but there is no indication that he engages in artistic activities. He does not mention any hobbies or interests related to art, music, or creative expression. His focus is more on civic engagement, education, and social justice, which suggests he may not identify strongly with having many artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Joshua describes himself as someone who is deeply connected to his community, volunteers, and works with kids at a community center. He also mentions having close friends, family, and a supportive network. While he is reflective and introspective at times, he is clearly engaged with others and values relationships. However, he does not explicitly describe himself as outgoing or sociable in a traditional sense—he seems more thoughtful and community-oriented than extroverted. He is sociable in the context of his work and activism, but not necessarily in a way that would align with a high score on this question.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Joshua Lawson comes across as empathetic, reflective, and focused on community support and personal growth. He frequently mentions his appreciation for others, his work with youth, and his efforts to be supportive and understanding. He does not exhibit tendencies to criticize or find fault with others, instead emphasizing connection, learning, and helping others. This suggests he would score low on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Joshua demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and commitment in his work with the community center, where he runs after-school programs and organizes workshops. He is described as being deeply involved with the youth, showing them that their voices matter, and ensuring they are supported.

            "BFI-10_9": "Joshua Lawson mentions experiencing anxiety-related symptoms, particularly during periods of high stress, such as during the pandemic resurgence and when juggling multiple responsibilities. He also acknowledges the importance of managing his mental health and setting boundaries to avoid burnout. While he doesn’t describe himself as someone who gets nervous easily, he does recognize the impact of stress and anxiety on his life, suggesting a moderate level of nervousness.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Joshua mentions being a quiet kid interested in reading and spending time with friends, which suggests a reflective and thoughtful nature. While he doesn't explicitly mention imagination, his engagement with community work, writing, and activism indicates a level of creativity and vision. However, he doesn't describe himself as someone who frequently engages in imaginative or creative pursuits beyond his work and activism, which suggests a more practical and grounded orientation."

            "BFI-10_1": "Joshua describes himself as a quiet kid who was more interested in reading and spending time with friends than in sports or typical teenage activities. He also mentions that he is reflective, values deep connections, and often takes time to process his thoughts before acting. These traits suggest a more reserved personality, though not to the extreme of being shy or withdrawn. He is socially engaged in his community and with friends, but his introspective nature aligns more with a lower score on the 'reserved' scale.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Joshua Lawson has demonstrated a strong sense of community involvement, empathy, and connection with others, including his work with youth and local activism. He often emphasizes the importance of trust in relationships, both personal and professional, and has spoken about the value of being open to experiences and people.

He is described as thoughtful, purposeful, and committed to making a difference. He also takes responsibility for his actions and is aware of the importance of self-care and balance. These traits suggest that he does not see himself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Joshua Lawson has discussed his struggles with anxiety and stress, particularly when juggling multiple responsibilities like work, volunteering, and community activism. While he has made efforts to manage his stress through mindfulness, journaling, and setting boundaries, he also admits to feeling overwhelmed at times. He has not described himself as consistently relaxed or stress-free, which suggests he would not score at the higher end of the scale. However, he has shown growth in managing his stress, which might place him somewhere in the middle.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Joshua mentions his involvement in community work, activism, and writing, but there is no explicit mention of artistic interests such as painting, music, or other forms of creative expression. His focus appears to be more on social issues, civic engagement, and helping others, which suggests a lower emphasis on artistic pursuits.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Joshua describes himself as someone who is involved in community work, volunteers, and has a strong network of friends and family. However, he also mentions that he is reflective, spends time alone reading or meditating, and is more interested in deep connections than in large social events. While he is clearly sociable in the context of his work and activism, he also shows a tendency toward introspection and personal reflection, which suggests a more balanced or moderate score.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Joshua Lawson describes himself as someone who is deeply connected to his community, values relationships, and is focused on supporting others, especially through his work with youth and activism. He emphasizes empathy, understanding, and the importance of being a positive influence. He does not show signs of being judgmental or critical of others, and instead focuses on making a difference and being supportive.",

He is described as being deeply involved with the youth in his neighborhood, showing a clear dedication to ensuring that the kids he works with are supported and engaged. His reflective nature, attention to personal growth, and the way he approaches his work with purpose suggest that he values thoroughness in his tasks.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Joshua Lawson describes experiencing anxiety-related symptoms in the past, particularly during periods of high stress and emotional labor. He acknowledges feeling overwhelmed at times, especially when juggling multiple responsibilities. While he has learned to manage his anxiety through therapy, meditation, and setting boundaries, he still identifies with moments of stress and uncertainty. This suggests he would likely rate himself somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale, but not at the extreme end of 5.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Joshua mentions being a quiet kid who was more interested in reading and spending time with friends than in sports or typical teenage activities. He also reflects on his work with youth education programs and his interest in civic engagement and activism, which suggests a thoughtful and reflective nature. While he is engaged in meaningful work, there is no explicit mention of creativity, imagination, or artistic pursuits. His self-description leans more toward practicality and community involvement rather than abstract or imaginative thinking."
