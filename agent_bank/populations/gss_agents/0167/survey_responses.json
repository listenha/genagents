            "BFI-10_1": "Joshua Lawson describes himself as a quiet kid who was more interested in reading and spending time with friends than in sports or typical teenage activities. He also mentions that he was reflective and thoughtful, and that he tends to let experiences guide him rather than force decisions. This suggests a more reserved nature. Additionally, he doesn't seem to seek the spotlight or express himself in overly assertive ways, which aligns with a lower score on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Joshua Lawson shows a strong sense of community, empathy, and connection with others, particularly the youth in his neighborhood. He describes working closely with kids, volunteering, and being involved in local activism, which suggests he is open to trusting others and believing in their potential. He also emphasizes the importance of relationships and support systems, which aligns with a trusting personality.",

He is described as intentional, purpose-driven, and committed to helping others. He also acknowledges his own need for self-care and balance, but there is no indication of laziness or avoidance of effort.",

He acknowledges moments of feeling overwhelmed and has had to learn coping strategies like mindfulness and setting boundaries. However, he also shows growth in managing his stress and has made intentional efforts to prioritize self-care.

            "BFI-10_6": "Joshua describes himself as someone who is deeply connected to his community, volunteers, and works with kids at a community center. He also mentions having close friends, family, and a supportive network. While he is reflective and introspective at times, he is clearly engaged with others and values relationships. However, he does not explicitly describe himself as outgoing or sociable in a traditional sense—he seems more thoughtful and community-oriented than extroverted. He is sociable in the context of his work and activism, but not necessarily in a way that would align with a high score on this question.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Joshua Lawson comes across as empathetic, reflective, and focused on community support and personal growth. He frequently mentions his appreciation for others, his work with youth, and his efforts to be supportive and understanding. He does not exhibit tendencies to criticize or find fault with others, instead emphasizing connection, learning, and helping others. This suggests he would score low on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Joshua demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and commitment in his work with the community center, where he runs after-school programs and organizes workshops. He is described as being deeply involved with the youth, showing them that their voices matter, and ensuring they are supported.

            "BFI-10_9": "Joshua Lawson mentions experiencing anxiety-related symptoms, particularly during periods of high stress, such as during the pandemic resurgence and when juggling multiple responsibilities. He also acknowledges the importance of managing his mental health and setting boundaries to avoid burnout. While he doesn’t describe himself as someone who gets nervous easily, he does recognize the impact of stress and anxiety on his life, suggesting a moderate level of nervousness.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Joshua mentions being a quiet kid interested in reading and spending time with friends, which suggests a reflective and thoughtful nature. While he doesn't explicitly mention imagination, his engagement with community work, writing, and activism indicates a level of creativity and vision. However, he doesn't describe himself as someone who frequently engages in imaginative or creative pursuits beyond his work and activism, which suggests a more practical and grounded orientation."

He also mentions that he is reflective, values deep connections, and often takes time to process his thoughts before acting. These traits suggest a more reserved personality, though not to the extreme of being shy or withdrawn.

While he has made efforts to manage his stress through mindfulness, journaling, and setting boundaries, he also admits to feeling overwhelmed at times. He has not described himself as consistently relaxed or stress-free, which suggests he would not score at the higher end of the scale. However, he has shown growth in managing his stress, which might place him somewhere in the middle.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Joshua mentions his involvement in community work, activism, and writing, but there is no explicit mention of artistic interests such as painting, music, or other forms of creative expression.

            "BFI-10_6": "Joshua describes himself as someone who is involved in community work, volunteers, and has a strong network of friends and family. However, he also mentions that he is reflective, spends time alone reading or meditating, and is more interested in deep connections than in large social events.

He acknowledges feeling overwhelmed at times, especially when juggling multiple responsibilities. While he has learned to manage his anxiety through therapy, meditation, and setting boundaries, he still identifies with moments of stress and uncertainty. This suggests he would likely rate himself somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale, but not at the extreme end of 5.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Joshua mentions being a quiet kid who was more interested in reading and spending time with friends than in sports or typical teenage activities.

            "BFI-10_2": "Joshua Lawson demonstrates a strong sense of community involvement, empathy, and a willingness to engage with others, especially youth in his neighborhood. He works closely with kids, volunteers, and is actively involved in local activism, which suggests he is open to trusting others and believing in their potential. His narrative reflects a belief in the power of connection and support systems, which aligns with a higher level of trust in others.",

He shows a strong sense of purpose, commitment to helping others, and an awareness of his own growth. These traits suggest he would not see himself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Joshua has openly discussed his struggles with anxiety and stress, particularly when juggling his part-time job, volunteer work, and personal responsibilities. He has also mentioned moments of feeling overwhelmed and the need to set boundaries and seek support. However, he has also shown growth in managing stress through mindfulness, journaling, and setting priorities. While he is not consistently relaxed, he has made efforts to improve his emotional resilience, which suggests he would not score the highest on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Joshua mentions his involvement in community work, writing, and activism, but does not express any specific interest in artistic pursuits like painting, music, or other forms of creative expression. His focus is more on social impact, education, and community service. While he does write, it is framed in the context of activism or freelance work, not as a personal artistic interest. This suggests he does not strongly identify with having many artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Joshua describes himself as someone who is deeply connected to his community, works with kids at a community center, and has close relationships with friends and family. He is involved in local activism and regularly interacts with others through his work and volunteer efforts. However, he also reflects on the need for personal reflection, balance, and boundaries, which suggests he may not be overly extroverted. He seems more introspective and thoughtful, which aligns more with a middle range rather than the highest end of sociability.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Joshua Lawson comes across as empathetic, supportive, and focused on community and personal growth. He reflects on his own struggles and emphasizes the importance of connection, understanding, and supporting others. He does not exhibit tendencies to criticize or find fault with others, and instead, he often highlights the importance of empathy and resilience. His perspective is more aligned with seeing the best in people and working to uplift them rather than pointing out their faults.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Joshua demonstrates a strong commitment to his work at the community center, where he helps run after-school programs and organizes workshops.

            "BFI-10_9": "Joshua has mentioned experiencing anxiety, particularly during periods of high stress and emotional labor, such as when juggling community work, volunteering, and personal responsibilities. He also described moments where he felt overwhelmed and needed to slow down and prioritize self-care. While he has learned to manage his anxiety through therapy, meditation, and setting boundaries, he still acknowledges that he has struggled with it. This suggests he would rate himself somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Joshua describes himself as someone who is deeply engaged with his community, values meaningful connections, and is reflective about his experiences. While he is not explicitly described as someone with a highly active imagination, his introspective nature, involvement in creative writing, and thoughtful approach to life suggest he has a reasonable level of imagination. However, he does not emphasize creativity or imaginative thinking as a core part of his identity, which leans him toward a middle or lower score."
