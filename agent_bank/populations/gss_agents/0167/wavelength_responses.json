My experience with math has involved understanding patterns, solving problems, and applying concepts in real-world contexts, which aligns more with the complex end of the spectrum.

My experiences with uncertainty, like navigating gentrification, managing multiple responsibilities, and dealing with anxiety, have shown me that life is full of unpredictable, chaotic moments. While there are patterns and causes, the law feels more like a reflection of life's inherent randomness."

I've experienced the noise of aircraft engines during flights or near airports, and it's always been a very loud, persistent sound. While there may be moments when it's slightly quieter (like during cruise mode), the overall nature of an aircraft engine is to produce a lot of noise.

They existed long before human civilization and were eventually wiped out by a random event (like an asteroid impact). This seems to align more with the idea that history is random and not necessarily moving toward improvement. Dinosaurs were not part of a linear progression of civilization but rather a unique and ultimately extinct chapter in Earth's story. While they did contribute to the evolution of life, their extinction highlights the unpredictability of history."

However, in certain social circles or contexts, like drinking with friends in a casual setting, it can be seen as cool.

While it could imply a sense of adventure or curiosity about a new city (wanderlust), the mention of 'candle light' also evokes a sense of warmth, comfort, and possibly nostalgia. This makes me think it leans more toward homesickness, as it feels like a quiet, reflective moment that might be missed or longed for in a familiar setting. However, it's not entirely about longing for home—it could also be about finding comfort in a new place. Still, the emotional weight of the candlelight feels more aligned with homesickness."

I've seen some horror movies that were genuinely scary, but I've also seen others that were more about the experience than the terror.
