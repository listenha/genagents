            "REI_4": "Based on the interview, Patrick O'Reilly described himself as someone who values his family, friends, and community, and seems to have a more spontaneous approach to his work and personal life. He mentioned that he tries to manage stress through mindfulness and relaxation techniques, suggesting a more intuitive and flexible mindset. This aligns more with someone who might not prioritize careful reasoning in decision-making.",
            "REI_5": "Given Patrick's description of his work as a social worker, which involves dealing with emotionally charged and often challenging situations, it suggests that he has developed some resilience and coping mechanisms. However, the nature of his job implies that he does face significant pressure. While he has a supportive network and engages in mindfulness practices, it's reasonable to assume that he still finds it difficult to reason well under pressure at times. Therefore, a middle ground seems most fitting.",

This suggests he has some confidence in his ability to figure things out, but he doesn't seem overly certain. He also mentions that his parents and friends provide him with support and advice, indicating he isn't entirely independent in his decision-making.

            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Patrick describes himself as slightly liberal and focuses on emotional and community-based values. He mentions his work in social services, which involves empathy and understanding, rather than purely logical approaches.

Given his balanced perspective, he is likely to lean towards the middle of the scale.",
            "REI_8": "Based on the interview, Patrick is described as someone who values deep thought and has made significant decisions after careful consideration, such as choosing to attend community college and pursue a degree in social work. He also mentions that he tries to manage stress through mindfulness practices and seeks guidance from his mentor, indicating a tendency to think things through carefully. Therefore, it's reasonable to predict that he would lean towards the higher end of the scale.",
            "REI_9": "Based on the interview, Patrick O'Reilly seems to be a highly logical and analytical person. He dedicates his career to social work, which requires a strong ability to analyze situations and develop effective interventions. Additionally, his commitment to professional development and the structured nature of his work suggest that he values and utilizes logical thinking. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that he would rate his ability to use logic in solving problems as a 5.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Patrick seems to have a strong sense of purpose and values rational thought and ethical principles in his decisions. He reflects on his choices and the values that guide them, indicating a tendency to have clear, explainable reasons for his actions.
