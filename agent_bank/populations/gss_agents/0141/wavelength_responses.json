I believe the risks of AGI, such as loss of control, inequality, and ethical challenges, outweigh its benefits unless there is strong oversight and a commitment to human-centered design.

My work in social services has also shown me that people's lives can be shaped by circumstances that seem random or unfair, even if there are patterns.

I think it depends heavily on the context and the culture. In my community, drinking is often seen as something that happens in moderation and with others, but it's not something that's celebrated in a way that would make it feel 'cool' to me personally.

From my perspective, a hand-written note often evokes warmth and personal connection, especially in my own life. I remember receiving notes from my mother or from friends that felt like a warm hug in words. These notes were filled with care, love, and intention. While a note could technically be cold or jagged, the act of writing by hand typically carries a sense of personal investment and emotional resonance, which aligns more with the 'warm and fuzzy' end of the spectrum."
