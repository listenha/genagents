  "agent_profile_summary": "Angel Rodriguez, a 20-year-old from Los Angeles, grew up in a working-class family in the Pacific area, where his parents' long hours at a factory and as a house cleaner shaped his early understanding of resilience and sacrifice. His life took a decisive turn during his junior year of high school when his teacher, Mrs. Alvarez, encouraged him to pursue college, leading him to apply for scholarships and break the cycle of limited opportunity in his family. Now in community college, Angel balances part-time work at a local bookstore with his studies, often relying on the support of his roommate, friends, and mentors. He is deeply committed to his education, seeing it as a path not only for himself but for his younger sister, Maria, whom he strives to be a role model for. Though he faces financial strain and health challenges like asthma, Angel remains focused on his goals, drawing strength from his faith, family, and the community that has supported him along the way."
