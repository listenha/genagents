An aircraft engine is not something that is quiet—it produces a significant amount of noise.

From a scientific perspective, the rise and fall of species, including dinosaurs, are shaped by unpredictable factors like environmental changes and natural disasters. This aligns more with the idea that history is random rather than a steady path of improvement. While humans have made advancements, the history of life on Earth is marked by randomness and extinction events, which makes the clue 'dinosaur' more aligned with the 'history is random' end of the spectrum."

Given my personal values and the context of my upbringing, I lean more toward the cringe side, especially when it comes to underage or excessive drinking, but I also recognize that in certain contexts, it can be seen as cool or normal."

It could represent a moment of reflection in a new place, which might stir feelings of homesickness, especially if the person is far from family or familiar surroundings. However, it could also symbolize a quiet moment of discovery or peace in a new environment, which might align with wanderlust. Given my own experiences of moving through life in Los Angeles, feeling both rooted and yearning for something more, I think this clue leans more toward homesickness. The imagery of candlelight often brings a sense of intimacy and nostalgia, which aligns with longing for home rather than the excitement of exploration."

While it lacks the natural zest of fruits or spices, it has a distinct, bold flavor profile that sets it apart from bland drinks. However, it's not typically described as 'zesty' in the way citrus or spicy foods are. It's more about a sharp, clean taste rather than a bold, vibrant one.
