            "BFI-10_1": "Angel Rodriguez describes himself as someone who is reflective, thoughtful, and often introspective. He shares his life story with honesty and depth, but there is no indication that he is overly expressive or enjoys being the center of attention.

He has also mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times, especially when managing his asthma and financial struggles.

He also works at a bookstore where he interacts with customers and coworkers, suggesting he is comfortable in social settings. However, he does not describe himself as particularly outgoing or someone who actively seeks out social situations.

            "BFI-10_9": "Angel has described moments of stress and anxiety in his life, such as when he was overwhelmed with school, work, and family responsibilities. He also mentioned having asthma, which he initially ignored due to stress, and has reflected on the importance of managing his mental health. While he has grown in his ability to cope, he has not described himself as someone who is consistently calm or unbothered. Instead, he acknowledges feeling overwhelmed at times, which suggests a moderate to higher tendency to get nervous.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Angel Rodriguez's interview shows a reflective and thoughtful nature, but there is no explicit mention of creativity, imagination, or engagement in artistic or abstract thinking.
