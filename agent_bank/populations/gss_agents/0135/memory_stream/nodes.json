Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAngel Rodriguez: I was born in Los Angeles, and I've spent my whole life here, which feels both comforting and limiting at times. Growing up in the Pacific area, I remember the sounds of the ocean and the smell of the salt in the air. My parents worked hard, but we never had much money. My dad worked at a factory, and my mom cleaned houses. They both only finished high school, but they always encouraged me to do better. I was the first in my family to graduate from high school, which felt like a huge accomplishment. I'm currently in school, trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I speak Spanish at home, and I've always felt connected to my Mexican roots, even though I was born in the U.S. I'm Catholic, and my faith has been a big part of my life, especially growing up in a close-knit family. I've never been married, and I've never served in the military, but I've always been focused on my education and making something of myself. I know I don't have a lot of money, but I'm determined to work my way up.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAngel Rodriguez: There was a moment during my junior year of high school when I realized I had a choice\u2014stay in the same cycle as my parents or try to break free. I had always been good in school, but I never really thought about what I wanted to do with my life. One day, my teacher, Mrs. Alvarez, noticed I was quiet during a discussion about college opportunities. She pulled me aside and asked me if I had ever considered going to college. I had never even thought about it, not because I didn't want to, but because I didn't know how. She offered to help me apply for scholarships and even connected me with a mentor who had grown up in the same neighborhood. That was the turning point. I started applying to colleges, and I got into a community college with a scholarship. It was the first time I felt like I had a real chance to change my future. I remember telling my parents that night, and they were so proud, even though they didn't fully understand what I was saying. That moment shaped who I am today\u2014it made me realize that I had the power to choose a different path, even if it wasn't easy.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nAngel Rodriguez: I think it was a conscious choice, but it felt like it just happened because I didn't realize how much I was capable of until that moment. I had always been told I could do better, but I never saw a clear path. Mrs. Alvarez gave me that path, and I chose to take it. It wasn't just about going to college\u2014it was about proving to myself and my family that I could break the cycle. I remember sitting at the kitchen table that night, looking at the scholarship letter, and feeling this mix of fear and excitement. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I also knew I didn't want to live the same life as my parents. That choice was mine, and I made it with my heart, even if I wasn't sure where it would lead.\n\n",

I think if it weren't for Mrs. Alvarez and that mentor, I might have stayed in the same place, just going through the motions. But there were others too\u2014like the community center in our neighborhood that offered free tutoring and college prep workshops. I didn't go at first because I felt embarrassed about needing help, but once I did, it opened up a whole world I didn't know existed. And then there were the scholarships themselves\u2014organizations that didn't just give money but also support, like counseling and mentorship programs. I think it takes a village, you know? People who believe in you even when you don't believe in yourself. I'm still grateful for every hand that reached out to me because without them, I don't think I would have had the courage to take that first step.\n\n",

I make sure to call them every week, and we talk about everything\u2014school, my future, even the struggles I face with money.

I realized how much of who I am today comes from that turning point in high school, when Mrs. Alvarez gave me the push I needed to believe in a future beyond my current circumstances. Talking about my family, especially my sister, reminded me of the responsibility I feel to be a role model and show her that dreams are possible, even if the path isn't clear at first.

My grandfather used to be a mechanic, and my grandmother was a teacher there before she moved to the U.S. to be closer to my parents. I have a close relationship with them, even though we don't talk as much as I'd like. My mom keeps in touch with them more often, and she translates for me when we speak on the phone.

One of them, Luis, is working at a local restaurant, and he's thinking about going back to school for culinary arts. We used to hang out all the time, talking about our futures, and even though things are busy for both of us now, I still check in on him. He's been a big support system for me, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed with school and money. Then there's my roommate, Javier, who's also in community college. We've been through a lot together\u2014late-night study sessions, figuring out how to budget, and even helping each other with applications. He's like a brother to me, and I know I can count on him.

The streets can be loud at night, with music and cars, but there's also a sense of community here. There are small businesses, like the corner store where I buy my groceries, and a few local restaurants that serve great food.

But I've learned to be aware of my surroundings, and I always stick to the main streets where there are more people around.

I've had to take on part-time jobs to help out, like working at a local bookstore a few days a week. It's not much, but it helps. On the other hand, there's a kind of resilience here that I admire.

My classes are in the morning, so I try to get there early to find a seat and get some work done before the day starts.

There were moments when I felt like I was making progress, like when I got accepted into a transfer program at a four-year university, which felt like a huge step forward. But there were also times when I felt overwhelmed, especially when I had to juggle more responsibilities at work and school. I remember one particular month when I was working late shifts at the bookstore, struggling with a heavy course load, and also helping my parents with some unexpected bills. I felt like I was running on empty, but I didn't want to give up. What kept me going was knowing that I was doing this for my sister, for my family, and for the future I want to build. I've also learned to ask for help more often, whether it's from my roommate, my mentor, or even my parents.

How about for you?\n\nAngel Rodriguez: I've definitely had moments where I felt really down, especially when things felt too heavy to handle. There were times when I'd sit in my room for hours, just staring at the ceiling, wondering if I was doing enough or if I'd ever get out of this cycle. I used to push those feelings aside, thinking I couldn't afford to feel weak or vulnerable. But over the past year, I've started to recognize that feeling anxious or even a little depressed isn't a sign of failure\u2014it's just part of the process. I've been talking to my mentor more about it, and she's helped me understand that it's okay to not have all the answers. I've also started seeing a counselor at the community center, which has been really helpful. It's not always easy opening up, but I've learned that taking care of my mental health is just as important as taking care of my body.

They want me to succeed, but they also want me to be safe and not take too many risks. My mom has been especially supportive, even though she doesn't always understand the details of what I'm doing. She keeps asking me, 'Are you sure this is the right path?' and I have to remind her that I've worked hard to get here. My sister, Maria, has been my biggest cheerleader\u2014she texts me every day to check in and tells me she's going to be the first in our family to go to college too.

How about you?\n\nAngel Rodriguez: For me, religion has always been a source of strength, especially growing up in a close-knit family where faith was a central part of our lives. My parents and grandparents always made sure we went to church on Sundays, and I remember sitting in the back of the pew, listening to the priest talk about God's love and the importance of family. Even though I'm not always sure I understand everything the priest says, I find comfort in the rituals\u2014like saying the rosary with my mom or lighting a candle for my sister before exams. It's not just about believing in God for me; it's about having that sense of hope and connection to something bigger than myself. When things get tough, like when I'm struggling with school or money, I find myself turning to prayer or going to Mass, not because I think it will fix everything, but because it reminds me that I'm not alone. I know some people might see religion as something outdated or restrictive, but for me, it's been a way to stay grounded and keep moving forward, even when the path isn't clear.\n\n",

I know a lot of people my age are always on their phones, scrolling through Instagram or Facebook, but I find it more distracting than helpful for me. I do have a Facebook account because my parents use it to stay in touch with family and friends back in Mexico, and I like being able to see photos of my grandparents or check in with my cousins. I also follow a few pages that post motivational quotes or stories about people from similar backgrounds, which sometimes gives me a boost when I'm feeling down. But I try not to get caught up in comparing my life to others' highlight reels. I've seen how social media can make people feel good or bad about themselves, and I don't want that to affect me. Instead, I prefer to stay connected through real conversations\u2014whether it's talking to my roommate, my sister, or even my parents on the phone.

Rent eats up about half of my paycheck, and it's always tight because I'm still in school and not making a lot of money. I live in a small apartment with my roommate, Javier, and we split the cost, but even then, it's a struggle sometimes. Groceries are another big one\u2014especially since I've been trying to eat healthier, which means buying more fresh produce and less processed food. I go to the local farmers' market on weekends when I can afford it, but sometimes I have to buy in bulk or look for sales to stretch my budget. Transportation is also a hit because I need to get to school, work, and sometimes help my parents out with errands. I use the bus most of the time, but when I'm running late or it's raining, I have to take a taxi or Uber, which can be expensive. My parents still help out when they can, but they're not making a lot either. It's a constant balancing act, trying to cover everything without going into debt. I've started tracking my expenses more carefully, and I'm trying to save even small amounts each month in case of emergencies.

Rent is the biggest chunk\u2014about $600 a month, which is a lot when you're splitting it with a roommate. Groceries come next, maybe around $300, and that's after I've started buying more fresh food and trying to eat better. Transportation is another $150 to $200, mostly for bus passes and the occasional taxi ride when I'm in a rush. Then there's the little stuff\u2014phone bills, utilities, and personal expenses like toiletries or a new pair of shoes. We don't have a lot of extra money, so we have to be really careful with every dollar. Some months are better than others, but I've learned to track everything in a notebook so I can see where the money is going.

My parents still live in the same house we grew up in, but they've been thinking about moving somewhere cheaper, maybe even a different part of the city.

In the summer, for example, we had to pay for air conditioning more than usual because it got really hot, and the electricity bill went up. Then, when school started again in the fall, I had to pay for more books and supplies, which added to the cost. We also had some unexpected expenses, like when my mom had to get her car fixed because the brakes were failing. That was a real hit to our budget, and we had to cut back on things like eating out or buying new clothes. Around the holidays, we tried to be more careful, but there were still costs for gifts and food. I remember one month when we had to skip a few meals just to cover the rent and utilities. It's been a lot to manage, but I've learned to be more flexible and find ways to save, like buying generic brands or using coupons when I can.

My parents both work full-time\u2014my dad at the factory and my mom as a cleaner\u2014but their wages aren't enough to cover everything, especially with rent and utilities. I make about $600 a month from the bookstore, and I try to put aside as much as I can, but it's still a struggle. Sometimes, I feel like we're just barely keeping our heads above water, but I know that every dollar we save, every small step we take, is helping us move forward. It's not about having a lot\u2014it's about not giving up, and that's something I'm learning to believe in more every day.\n\n",

The hours are flexible, which helps me balance school and my other responsibilities. As for benefits, well, I don't get health insurance or paid time off through the job, but the manager is pretty understanding when things get tough. If I'm running late because of school or need to leave early for a family emergency, she usually lets me make it up another day. The best part is the people I work with\u2014they're like a second family. We all have our own struggles, but we support each other. I've learned a lot from them, not just about books, but about life. It's not a perfect job, but it's given me a sense of purpose and a little bit of independence, which means a lot to me.\n\n",

She's been through a lot in her life, just like me, and she always reminds me that it's okay to struggle as long as I keep trying. She's never been harsh with me, even when I've made mistakes, and she's always willing to give me a second chance. As for my coworkers, we all have our own stories, our own reasons for being there. Some of them are students like me, others are older and have been working for years. We don't talk about our personal lives too much, but there's a sense of mutual respect. If someone is having a rough day, we look out for each other. I think that's what makes this place feel like more than just a job\u2014it feels like a place where people care, even if they don't know you well. I'm grateful for that because it's not something I take for granted.\n\n",

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nAngel Rodriguez: My work schedule is pretty flexible, which is one of the reasons I've been able to keep up with school and my other responsibilities. Most of the time, I work weekends and a few afternoons during the week, but if I need to adjust my hours for an exam or a family obligation, the manager is usually okay with it. There are days when I have to stay late to help close up, and other days when I can leave early if I'm running behind. It's not always perfect, but I've learned to plan ahead and communicate with my manager so we can find a solution that works for both of us. I think that flexibility is what makes this job manageable for someone like me, who's still figuring things out but trying to do the best I can.\n\n",

It's not easy, and there are days when I feel like I'm barely keeping up, but I also know that I'm not standing still. Every month, I'm learning more about how to manage my money, how to prioritize what really matters, and how to ask for help when I need it. I don't have a lot, but I'm not stuck. I see progress in small ways\u2014like being able to save a little each month, or getting better grades in school, or even just feeling more confident in my decisions. I know I'm not where I want to be financially, but I'm not giving up. I believe that if I keep working hard, staying focused, and making smart choices, I can build a better future for myself and my family. It's going to take time, but I'm ready for that journey.\n\n",

It's not just about money; it's about learning to adapt and find ways to make it work, even when things get tight. I used to feel like I was failing because I couldn't afford everything, but now I see it as part of the journey. I've also come to understand that saving, even in small ways, is important for my future. It's not about having a lot\u2014it's about being responsible and making the most of what I have.

My dad worked at a factory for over ten years, and my mom was a house cleaner for different families. They both worked long hours, often from early morning until late afternoon, and sometimes even into the evening. I remember seeing my mom come home exhausted, her hands sore from scrubbing floors, and my dad would be quiet after his shift, just sitting on the couch with his hat on. They never complained, but I could tell they were tired. They always made sure I had food on the table and a place to sleep, even when they didn't have much themselves. I used to feel guilty for wanting more, for wanting to go to college, because I knew they had given up a lot to give me a chance. But looking back, I realize that their hard work was the foundation that got me here. I didn't know it at the time, but they were building a future for me, even if they couldn't see it themselves.

His most important duties were making sure the products met quality standards and keeping up with the pace of the production line.

Her most important duties were making sure the homes were spotless and the families were satisfied. Both of them had to be very responsible and reliable, because their jobs depended on showing up on time and doing the work right.

The factory was a big place, with long rows of workers assembling parts for cars. It was loud, hot, and sometimes dangerous, but my dad always said it was steady work. He never talked much about the conditions, just about the fact that it paid the bills. My mom's job was more varied\u2014some days she'd clean a single-family home, other days she'd work for a larger household with multiple floors and more chores. She always said she liked the variety, but I could tell it was hard on her body.

I want to be in a place where I can focus on my studies without constantly worrying about money or whether I'll be able to afford the next semester.
