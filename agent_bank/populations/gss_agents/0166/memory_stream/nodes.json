    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAnthony Santana: Well, I was born and raised in Providence, Rhode Island, but I actually grew up in a small town in New England\u2014specifically, in a place called Narragansett. My parents were both working-class folks, and while things weren't ever really hard, we never had a lot of extra money either. My dad worked at a local factory for most of his life, and my mom went to community college and worked part-time at a library. I always admired her for that\u2014she was the one who pushed me to value education, even though she didn't have the chance to go to college herself. I was the first in my family to graduate from college, which was a big deal. I studied political science at Brown University, which was pretty intimidating at first, but I found my footing there. I wasn't really into politics growing up, but I became more interested in social issues as I got older, especially after seeing how people in my community were affected by things like healthcare access and education funding. I've always been more of a liberal thinker, and I guess that's why I ended up leaning toward the Democratic Party, even if I don't identify as a super strong Democrat. I've never been married, and I don't really see myself getting married anytime soon\u2014I've been focused on my career and my personal growth. I work full-time now as a policy analyst for a non-profit that focuses on economic equity, which is something I'm really passionate about. I also speak Spanish pretty fluently, which I picked up from my grandmother who grew up in Spain. I've always felt like I had two homes\u2014one in Rhode Island and one in my memories of Spain. I'm pretty content with my life right now, even though it's not perfect. I've had my share of struggles, but I've also had a lot of opportunities, and I'm grateful for that.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAnthony Santana: Yeah, there was definitely a crossroads moment for me\u2014right after I graduated from college. I had two real options: one was to take a job with a government agency in Washington, D.C., doing policy work, which would have been a stable, well-paying job with good benefits. The other was to stay in Rhode Island and work for a local non-profit that focused on community development and education access. I was torn because the D.C. job would have given me more visibility and potentially more influence on a national level, but I also knew that I wanted to make a real, tangible difference in the place I grew up. I remember talking to my mom about it one night, and she just said, 'You don't have to leave to make an impact. You can be the change right here.' That stuck with me. I ended up taking the non-profit job, and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. I got to work directly with people in my community, see the real effects of policy on a local level, and it solidified my passion for economic equity. I think that choice made me who I am today\u2014someone who values grassroots change over just climbing the ladder.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nAnthony Santana: I think for me, it was a conscious choice, but not in the way you might expect. I didn't sit down and make a grand decision with a list of pros and cons\u2014I just felt it in my gut. I've always been someone who listens more than I speak, and I think that's why I was able to hear my mom's words that night. It wasn't just about the job; it was about where I wanted to be in life. I wanted to be rooted in the community that shaped me, to be someone who could look people in the eye and say, 'I understand where you're coming from.' That feeling was real, and I made a choice based on that. I think sometimes people say it 'just happened' because they don't want to admit they had the power to choose. But I believe we always have a choice\u2014it's just a matter of whether we're brave enough to make it.\n\n",

When I was making that decision about the job, my mom was definitely a big influence, but I also had a mentor at the non-profit who really believed in my potential. Her name was Maria, and she had been working in community development for over 20 years. She saw something in me that I didn't see in myself at the time, and she encouraged me to take the leap. She even offered to help me with the transition, introducing me to people in the field and giving me advice on how to navigate the work. Without her support, I don't know if I would have had the confidence to stay in Rhode Island. It's funny, though\u2014I think sometimes we underestimate the role that other people play in our decisions. We like to think we're making choices all on our own, but the truth is, we're always standing on the shoulders of others.\n\n",

I've been focused on my work and personal growth, and honestly, I don't know if I'm ready for the responsibilities that come with a relationship or family life. That said, I have a close-knit family that I value a lot. My parents are still in Narragansett, and even though I live in Providence now, I make it a point to visit them as often as I can. My mom, in particular, has been a huge support system for me\u2014she's the one who always reminds me to take time for myself and not get too caught up in work. My dad, while not as involved in my day-to-day life, has always been there with a joke or a story about his time at the factory. I also have an older sister who lives in Boston; she's a nurse, and we talk almost every week. She's the one who keeps me grounded, even when I'm getting too deep into policy debates. I don't think I'd ever want to be completely alone, but I also don't feel the need to rush into anything. For now, my family is my anchor, and I'm grateful for them.\n\n",

We don't have any extended family living nearby, but we're all very close. My grandparents on my mom's side passed away a few years ago, but I still remember them fondly. My grandfather was a big influence on me; he had a love for storytelling and history, and he always made me feel like I could achieve anything if I worked hard enough. My grandmother, as I mentioned before, was from Spain, and she taught me Spanish when I was a kid. She used to tell me stories about growing up in Seville, and I think that's where my love for language and culture came from. Even though she's not around anymore, I still feel her presence in my life, especially when I'm speaking Spanish or cooking traditional dishes. I don't have any siblings other than my older sister, and while we're very different in terms of personalities and careers, we share a deep respect for each other. She's the one who always reminds me to stay humble, and I think that's something I carry with me every day.\n\n",

Are there people outside of your family who are important to you?\n\nAnthony Santana: Outside of my family, there are a few friends and colleagues who have been really important to me. One of them is Jamal, who I met during my time at Brown. He was a sociology major, and we bonded over our shared interest in social justice issues. He's the one who introduced me to a lot of the local activists in Providence, and through him, I got involved in some community organizing efforts that really shaped my career path. We haven't stayed in touch as much as I'd like, but I still respect him a lot and think about him often. Then there's my coworker, Elena, who I've been working with for the past few years. She's been a great mentor and friend\u2014she's always pushing me to think more critically about the policies we work on and to stay connected to the people we're trying to help. I also have a few close friends from high school who I still keep in touch with, even though we all went different ways after graduation. They're the ones who remind me to have fun and not take life too seriously. I think it's important to have people in your life who challenge you, support you, and just make you laugh.

It's a pretty tight-knit area, with a lot of historic homes and a strong sense of community. There are a few small businesses, some great coffee shops, and a community center that hosts events throughout the year. I really like that it's not too far from downtown, but still has that local feel. I live in a two-bedroom apartment on the second floor of a converted townhouse, and it's actually pretty cozy. The building has a small courtyard where people gather on nice days, and I've gotten to know a few of my neighbors over the years. One of them is an artist named Luis, who lives across the hall\u2014he's always painting or working on some kind of sculpture. We don't talk much, but I appreciate the creativity around me. The area has its challenges, like with gentrification and rising rents, which is something I've been thinking a lot about in my work. I want to make sure that places like Fox Point remain accessible to the people who have lived here for generations. It's a part of the city that has a rich history, and I feel lucky to be a part of it, even if just for now.\n\n",

It's not perfect\u2014like anywhere else\u2014it has its issues, but I've never felt threatened or unsafe in my own neighborhood. There's a sense of familiarity here, and I think that makes a big difference. I know most of the people who live around me, at least by face, and there's a mutual respect that comes with that. That said, I do worry about how gentrification is changing things. I've seen some long-time residents move out because of rising rents, and it's sad. I don't want to see the character of the neighborhood disappear just because it's becoming more expensive. Safety is about more than just crime\u2014it's about who gets to feel welcome and protected in a place. I hope that as the neighborhood changes, it still stays a place where people like me, who grew up here, can afford to stay.\n\n",

Even with the changes, there's a real connection between neighbors, and I've made some good friends through the local events and the community center. I also appreciate being close to downtown\u2014there's always something going on, whether it's a concert in the park or a new restaurant opening. But the downs?

I usually start my week early\u2014around 6:30 a.m.\u2014with a quick workout at the local gym, which is actually a community center that offers free classes to residents. After that, I head to my office, which is just a 15-minute walk from my apartment. My days are mostly spent analyzing data, drafting reports, and meeting with stakeholders to discuss policy proposals. Mondays are usually the busiest, with team meetings and strategy sessions. Tuesdays and Wednesdays tend to be more focused on individual work, like researching new programs or writing grants. Thursdays are often spent in the field\u2014visiting schools, community centers, or talking to residents about their experiences with local policies. Fridays are a bit more relaxed, but I still have meetings or events to attend. I try to end my workday around 5:30 p.m. and then head home for dinner. On weekends, I like to spend time with my family or catch up with friends. I also volunteer at a local food pantry once a month, which is something I really value.

There's something comforting about making food that reminds me of her, even if I'm not perfect at it.

It's something I picked up from a friend who works in mental health, and I've found it really helps me center myself before the day begins.

About a year ago, I started experiencing some persistent lower back pain after a long day at the office. At first, I thought it was just from sitting too much or maybe a minor strain, but it didn't go away. I finally made an appointment with a physical therapist, and it turned out to be a combination of poor posture and muscle tension from carrying a lot of stress. The therapist worked with me on some exercises to strengthen my core and improve my posture, and I also started incorporating more stretching into my daily routine. It was a wake-up call for me\u2014reminding me that even if I'm physically active, I can still neglect other parts of my body. Since then, I've been more mindful of how I sit, stand, and move throughout the day. I also started taking short walks during my lunch break, which has helped a lot. It wasn't a major health issue, but it was a reminder that taking care of my body is an ongoing process, not something I can just check off once in a while.\n\n",

How about you?\n\nAnthony Santana: Honestly, the back pain didn't really interfere with my work or my ability to care for others, but it did make me realize how much I take my body for granted. I've always been pretty active, so it was surprising to feel like something was holding me back, even if it was just minor discomfort. What it did do, though, was make me more aware of how stress and posture can affect your physical health in ways you don't always notice. I think that's something a lot of people in my line of work deal with\u2014we're constantly thinking, analyzing, and problem-solving, and it can take a toll if you're not careful. I've made some changes to my routine to prevent it from happening again, like taking more breaks during the day and making sure I'm not hunching over my desk for hours at a time. It's not just about staying healthy for the sake of it\u2014it's about being able to show up for the people I care about and the work I do. I don't want to be someone who's always pushing through pain or burnout, because that doesn't help anyone in the long run.\n\n",

There's been a lot of growth in my work, especially with some of the policy initiatives we've been pushing for economic equity in Providence. It's been rewarding to see some of the programs we advocated for actually get implemented, like the new community education grants and the housing assistance pilot. But with that comes a lot of pressure, and I've had to be really intentional about how I manage my energy. I think I've been more aware of my mental health than ever before, which is a good thing. I've also been trying to reconnect with parts of my identity that I sometimes neglect, like my Spanish roots. I've been cooking more of my grandmother's recipes and even started learning some traditional songs on the guitar. It's been a way to honor her memory and keep that part of my heritage alive. I've also been thinking a lot about the future\u2014where I want to take my work, how I want to contribute to my community, and what kind of impact I want to leave behind.

The back pain I experienced was a wake-up call that even small changes in posture and routine can have a big impact.

How about for you?\n\nAnthony Santana: I think I've been fortunate in that I haven't struggled with depression or anxiety in the way some people do, but I wouldn't say I've been completely free from it. There have been moments\u2014especially during particularly intense periods at work or when I've felt the weight of not making enough progress on the issues I care about\u2014where I've felt a bit overwhelmed or disconnected. I remember one time, a few years back, when I was working on a major policy proposal and I just felt like I was spinning my wheels, no matter how hard I tried. I didn't want to talk about it with anyone because I didn't want to seem like I was failing. But looking back, I realize that was a sign I needed to take a step back and check in with myself. That's why I started seeing a therapist\u2014it wasn't because I was in crisis, but because I wanted to be more proactive about my mental health. I think it's important to recognize that even if you're not in a place of severe struggle, you can still benefit from support and reflection. I've learned that it's okay to not be okay all the time, and that taking care of your mental health is just as important as taking care of your physical health.\n\n",

She still keeps busy with her gardening and her book club, which is a big part of her life. My dad, on the other hand, has been more reflective lately. He's been telling stories about his time at the factory, and I've been listening a lot more than I used to. It's funny how time changes the way we see things\u2014I used to think he was just telling stories to pass the time, but now I realize they're a way for him to connect with me and share the lessons he learned from his work. My sister has been going through a lot with her nursing job, especially with the ongoing healthcare challenges in Boston. She's been working long hours, but she still makes time to call me and check in. I think she sees me as a kind of anchor, just like I see her.

Growing up, my family wasn't religious, and I never really felt the need to fill that space with something formal. That said, I think there's a kind of spirituality in the everyday moments\u2014like the way my mom always makes time for her garden, or how my sister finds purpose in helping others through her nursing work. I don't believe in a higher power in the traditional sense, but I do believe in the power of human connection, the importance of community, and the value of doing what you can to make the world a little better. I think that's where my sense of purpose comes from. It's not about praying or going to church\u2014it's about showing up for the people around me, staying rooted in the values I was raised with, and trying to leave things better than I found them.

I've always been more of a person who prefers face-to-face interactions or phone calls over scrolling through feeds. That said, I do have a Facebook account where I stay in touch with family and a few old friends from college. I'll post the occasional photo of my guitar playing or share a recipe I'm trying out, but I'm not really into the whole 'curated life' thing.

I've seen people in my field use it to raise awareness or get funding for projects, and that's definitely a valid use. But for me personally, I prefer to keep my support systems offline.

I used to feel like I was constantly on edge, especially when I was pushing for policy changes or dealing with tight deadlines. But now, I've started to build in more moments of reflection and self-care. I've been journaling more, which helps me process my thoughts and emotions without getting stuck in them.

I think the biggest change has been how I view stress itself.

My biggest expenses are rent, which takes up about a third of my income, and groceries, especially since I try to cook most of my meals at home. I also have a car payment, which is necessary since public transportation isn't always the most convenient in Providence, especially when I need to travel to different parts of the city for work or community events.

The breakdown is pretty standard\u2014rent is the biggest chunk, around $1,200, and then groceries come in at about $600. I try to cook most of my meals at home, which helps keep that cost down, but I do splurge a bit on fresh produce and local meat from the farmers' market. My car payment is around $350, and utilities and internet are another $300 or so. I also set aside about $200 for savings and retirement contributions, even if it's not a lot. I don't have any major debt, which is something I'm really grateful for, but I do have to be careful with my budget, especially with the rising costs of living in Providence.

In the winter, my utility bills went up a bit because of heating, and I had to be more careful with my budget to make sure I wasn't overspending. Then, in the spring, I had to pay for a new set of tires for my car, which was unexpected but necessary.

Mondays are typically the busiest, with team meetings and strategy sessions that can run late into the afternoon. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are more about focused work\u2014analyzing data, drafting reports, and preparing for stakeholder meetings. Thursdays are often spent in the field, visiting schools, community centers, or meeting with residents to understand their needs and experiences. Fridays can be a bit more relaxed, but I still have meetings or events to attend. I try to leave the office by 5:30 p.m. most days, though I often stay late a few times a week when I'm working on big projects or preparing for meetings. I also do some evening work from home, especially when I'm reviewing reports or collaborating with colleagues in different time zones. It's a demanding schedule, but I find balance in the rhythm of it all, and I think that's what keeps me grounded.\n\n",

I've always focused on one role at a time, especially since the work I do is pretty demanding and requires a lot of attention to detail. That said, I have taken on some side projects or freelance work in the past, especially when I was in school or just starting out in my career. For example, I used to write articles for a local community magazine about social issues and education access, which was a great way to practice my writing and get more involved in the conversations happening in Providence. I also did some volunteer work with a youth mentorship program, which wasn't paid, but it was incredibly rewarding. I think it's important to stay engaged with your community in different ways, even if it's not through a full-time job. But for the most part, I've been focused on my work at Rhode Island Equity Now, and I don't see myself branching out into other jobs anytime soon. I think having one clear focus helps me stay productive and present for the people I serve.\n\n",

At the same time, thinking about my monthly budget and how I make ends meet reminded me of the importance of balance\u2014not just in my finances, but in how I approach life overall. I've come to see that stability isn't about perfection; it's about being intentional with my time, money, and emotional energy. I'm grateful for the support of my family, the small savings I've built, and the routines that keep me connected to what matters most.

That's pretty much in line with what I usually earn, considering my salary as a policy analyst. I don't have any other sources of income, so it's all based on my full-time job. I try to budget carefully, making sure that my expenses don't exceed what I bring in. I've been lucky to have a stable income, which has allowed me to save a little and also contribute to my retirement fund. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to keep me comfortable and focused on the work I do. I also try to support local businesses when I can, whether it's buying coffee from the corner shop or shopping at the farmers' market. It's a way to give back to the community that's supported me all these years.\n\n",

The benefits of the job are pretty standard for a non-profit\u2014health insurance is covered, though it's not the most comprehensive plan, but it's enough to get me through check-ups and prescriptions. We get a decent amount of paid time off, which is something I really appreciate, especially since I've been working long hours on some projects. I get about two weeks of vacation a year, and I try to use that time to recharge, whether it's going on a road trip with my sister or just taking a few days to be alone with a book and my guitar. We also have sick days, which is important because I've learned that taking time to rest when I'm not feeling well is crucial for staying productive in the long run. One of the things I like most about the job is the flexibility\u2014it's not as rigid as a government position, and that gives me the space to be creative and really connect with the people we're trying to help. I think the benefits aren't just about the money or the insurance; they're about the freedom to show up as my best self, both for the work and for the people I care about.\n\n",

She's always pushing me to think critically about the policies we're working on and to stay connected to the people we're trying to help. I trust her judgment, and I know she has my back, even when I'm not sure about a decision. As for my coworkers, we have a pretty tight-knit team. We've been through a lot together\u2014late nights, tight deadlines, and the occasional policy debate that gets heated\u2014but we always come back to the same goal: making a real difference in people's lives. I think that shared purpose is what keeps us connected. We don't just see each other as colleagues; we see each other as people who care about the same things.

Most days, I start around 8:30 a.m. and finish by 5:30 p.m., but I often stay late a few times a week, especially when we're working on big projects or preparing for meetings. The flexibility comes in when I need to adjust my hours for fieldwork or when I have to attend community events. For example, if I'm visiting a school or meeting with stakeholders, I might leave the office a bit earlier or stay later depending on how things go. I also have the option to work from home a couple of days a week, which is helpful when I need to focus on a report or when I'm feeling overwhelmed.

I don't have a lot of savings, and I'm definitely not rolling in wealth, but I've managed to build a life that allows me to do the work I care about and stay connected to the people who matter most.

That said, I'm not naive\u2014I know that financial security is important, and I've had to make some tough choices to keep things manageable. I've cut back on non-essentials, like dining out or buying things I don't really need, and I've learned to be really intentional with my budget. I also try to support myself through the work I do, whether it's through grants, community partnerships, or even the occasional speaking engagement. I don't see myself getting rich, but I don't need to.

It wasn't the most glamorous job, but it gave him a steady income and a sense of purpose.

He never had a lot of money, but he always made sure we had what we needed. My mom, on the other hand, worked part-time at the library after she finished community college.

It was repetitive work, but he found a kind of rhythm in it. He'd start his shift early in the morning, usually around 6 a.m., and work until 3 p.m. or so. The most important part of his job, he always said, was making sure everything was done right, even if no one was watching. He took pride in that, in knowing that the machines he helped build were going to be used by people all over the country. He never talked about the hardships, like the long hours or the physical toll it took on his body, but I could see it in the way he moved after work\u2014his back would always be a little hunched, and his hands would be calloused from years of handling metal. My mom, on the other hand, worked at the library as a circulation assistant. Her job was more about people than machines. She checked books in and out, helped kids find the right section for their school projects, and always made time to talk to the regulars who came in every day. She loved that part of it\u2014the way she could connect with people through stories and knowledge.
