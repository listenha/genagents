My experience with math has been that it can be both intuitive and challenging, depending on the context.

It is not bland, but it also doesn't reach the level of extreme zestiness that would place it at 100.

My own experience with math has been a mix of both—while I found the basics manageable, I also appreciated the complexity of higher-level math and its real-world applications in policy analysis, such as data interpretation and modeling.
