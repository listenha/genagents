My own experiences growing up in Lithuania, where traditional aesthetics and family values played a significant role in defining beauty, and my current life in Cambridge, where diverse perspectives on beauty are common, have shown me that beauty is often in the eye of the beholder.

Given my perspective, I see history as a mix of both progress and randomness, but the clue 'dinosaur' leans more toward the idea of randomness because their existence and extinction were not part of a linear path of improvement. They were a significant part of Earth's history, but their story doesn't align with the idea of continuous improvement."

While it mentions a 'New City,' which might suggest exploration or a fresh start, the imagery of candlelight often evokes warmth, intimacy, and a longing for comfort or familiarity.
