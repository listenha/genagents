Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nStephanie Wilson: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Portland, Oregon, and grew up in a relatively stable household. My parents were both working-class individuals, and they did their best to provide for us. My father, Richard, worked at a local community college and held an associate degree, while my mother, Sarah, was a nurse's aide. She had only completed high school but worked hard to support our family. We lived in a nice neighborhood in Portland, and I always felt safe and secure there.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nStephanie Wilson: One such moment came when I was in high school. I had always been good at math and science, and I had the opportunity to join the robotics club. It was a challenging environment, but it also opened up a world of possibilities that I hadn't considered before. One day, our team was competing in a regional competition, and we faced a tough opponent. We were losing, and I remember feeling really discouraged. But instead of giving up, I decided to stay focused and work harder. We ended up winning the competition, and that experience taught me the importance of perseverance. It also led me to pursue a degree in engineering, which has been a rewarding journey so far.\n\n",

It wasn't a conscious decision, but rather a realization that I wanted to continue pushing myself and see what else I could accomplish. After that, I knew I wanted to go into engineering and make a difference in the world through technology.\n\n",

For example, my neighbor once helped me carry furniture when my car broke down, and another neighbor kept an eye on my house when I was out of town.

It's been challenging to balance the demands of my job with my personal commitments, but I've been using a variety of coping strategies. I've started meditating more regularly, which has helped me stay calm and focused. I also make sure to prioritize my sleep and try to take short breaks during the day to recharge. Additionally, I've been more intentional about reaching out to friends and family when I need support, which has been really helpful.\n\n",

Rent takes up about half of my income, and groceries are essential, especially since I like to cook at home. Other significant expenses include transportation and utilities. I try to save some money each month for emergencies or future projects, and I'm glad to say that I've been able to build a small emergency fund.\n\n",

During the colder months, I had to pay a bit more for heating, but it wasn't too drastic. My car insurance premiums have remained the same, and my cell phone bill is predictable.

From my humble beginnings in Portland, Oregon, to my current role as a software engineer, every step of my journey has been significant. The choices I've made, whether consciously or subconsciously, have instilled in me a strong sense of perseverance and the importance of hard work. The support and encouragement from my family, particularly my parents, have been invaluable, and I feel grateful for the values they instilled in me, such as dedication and community. The pivotal moment in high school when I joined the robotics club not only opened up a world of possibilities but also taught me the importance of resilience in the face of challenges. These experiences have guided me as I pursue my career and navigate my personal life, highlighting the importance of balance and the continuous pursuit of personal growth. Through this process, I've also recognized the value of having a strong support network, both personally and digitally, which has been instrumental in maintaining my emotional well-being and resilience. As I move forward, I remain committed to balancing my professional and personal life, striving to find fulfillment in both areas while staying true to my values and aspirations.",
