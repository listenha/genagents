  "agent_profile_summary": "Stephanie Wilson, 26, grew up in Portland, Oregon, in a working-class family where her father worked at a community college and her mother was a nurse’s aide. A defining moment came in high school when she joined the robotics club, where a close call during a competition sparked her determination to persevere and ultimately led her to pursue engineering. Now a software engineer at a tech startup, she balances a demanding career with a structured routine that includes morning workouts, community involvement, and mentoring young students in STEM. Her life reflects a steady drive toward growth and stability, whether through her professional ambitions, her commitment to giving back, or her efforts to maintain a healthy lifestyle. She values family deeply, remains open to future partnerships, and continues to navigate the balance between career success and personal fulfillment."
