She has described herself as someone who can handle stress and challenges with resilience, which suggests she is adaptable. However, her preference for a balanced lifestyle and the support of a strong network, both personally and professionally, indicates that she values social connections and comfort in social settings. Given her desire to maintain a balance between work and personal life, it is likely that she sees herself as more on the middle or slightly reserved side rather than extremely outgoing.",

She has described herself as someone who stays focused and perseveres through challenges, such as the robotics competition and her current work as a software engineer. Her emphasis on personal development, maintaining a routine, and working towards goals suggests she is not someone who sees herself as lazy. Instead, she appears to be proactive and disciplined.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Based on the interview, Stephanie seems to handle stress reasonably well, although she mentions moments of feeling overwhelmed due to work deadlines. She uses coping strategies like meditation and prioritizing sleep to manage stress. She also has a supportive network of friends and family who provide emotional support. While she does mention some stress, she doesn't indicate frequent or severe stress issues. Therefore, a score of 3 seems most appropriate, but given the range, a 4 or 5 would be more fitting as she does handle stress relatively well.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on Stephanie's responses, she seems to value practical skills and has a structured, goal-oriented approach to her life. She focuses on her career as a software engineer and her personal development through online courses and volunteering.

            "BFI-10_9": "Based on the interview, Stephanie described herself as someone who has experienced moments of stress and anxiety, particularly during work deadlines. However, she also mentioned using coping strategies like meditation and reaching out to friends for support, which suggests she is generally able to manage these feelings. She does not appear to have a pervasive nervousness that defines her personality or daily life, but she does acknowledge that stress can be a factor. Therefore, it seems more likely that she would fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Stephanie is described as someone who has faced challenges and achieved success through perseverance and hard work. While she emphasizes her logical and structured approach to life, there are indications that she has also been driven by her interests and passions.
