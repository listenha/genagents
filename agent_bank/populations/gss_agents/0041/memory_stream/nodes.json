Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nJessica Williams: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Portland, Oregon, which has been my home since I was a little girl. Growing up, my parents were divorced when I was six, and they both lived separately in different parts of the city. My mom worked full-time as a nurse, while my dad was mostly absent from our lives. Despite the challenges, my mother did her best to raise me and my younger brother. She instilled in us the importance of education and hard work. I remember going to Catholic school until high school, where I switched to a public school because it was closer to my mom's workplace. My high school years were a mix of academic rigor and social life, but I always felt like I was part of two different worlds \u2013 the Catholic one at first and then the public school one later on. My family income was average, but we managed to get by. After graduating, I went on to college and pursued a graduate degree in social work. It was a challenging but rewarding journey.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nJessica Williams: One such moment came during my sophomore year of college. I was faced with the decision of either continuing with my social work path or pursuing a career in law. Both options were exciting, but they seemed to represent very different directions in my life. I decided to shadow a social worker and a lawyer to better understand each field. The experience with the social worker was incredibly fulfilling; seeing how she helped people navigate difficult situations and make positive changes in their lives really resonated with me. However, the lawyer I shadowed also showed me how impactful legal work could be, especially in advocating for justice and systemic change. In the end, I chose to stay on the social work path, but I took away a lot of valuable insights from the legal world that I use in my work today. This decision solidified my passion for helping others and working towards social justice.\n\n",

Reflecting on those experiences, I realized that while both fields were important, social work aligned more closely with my values and my desire to make a direct impact on individuals' lives. The social worker I shadowed had a deep sense of empathy and a genuine commitment to helping people overcome obstacles, which inspired me. I believe that this choice reflects my upbringing and the lessons my mother taught me about compassion and service.\n\n",

The excitement of planning for a family has brought a lot of joy, but it also adds a layer of responsibility and uncertainty. Balancing work, planning for the future, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle has been challenging. I've been relying more on my support system, like regular check-ins with John and my friends, to help manage the stress. Additionally, I've been trying to incorporate more mindfulness exercises into my routine, such as short guided meditations during lunch breaks, to keep my emotions in check. It's a continuous process, but I'm grateful for the tools and people that help me cope.\n\n",

Our main expenses include rent, groceries, utilities, and transportation. Rent for our house is around $1,500 per month, and we try to keep groceries under $500 to maintain a balanced budget. Utilities, including electricity and internet, are around $200, and transportation costs for both of us commuting to work are about $200. We've been fortunate to have a good emergency fund, which helps cover unexpected expenses. Last month, we spent a bit extra on a home improvement project, so our total expenses were around $2,800. Fortunately, we're both able to contribute financially to our household, and we try to live within our means.\n\n",

We try to save some money each month, and right now, we aim to put aside about $200 for emergencies and future expenses.\n\n",

In the colder months, we used more heating, which increased our bills. We also had higher water bills because of our home improvement project, as we needed more water for painting and cleaning. During the summer, we relied more on air conditioning, which again bumped up our energy costs.

My relationship with John, my brother Michael, and my close friends from college has been instrumental in providing emotional support and practical assistance. The challenges of balancing work, family, and community involvement have taught me the importance of resilience and the value of a strong support system. Looking ahead, I am excited about the future, eager to build a home with John and our child, and to continue making a positive impact in the social work field. This interview has not only captured my past and present but has also illuminated the path I intend to take in the future, filled with love, purpose, and a commitment to serving others.",
