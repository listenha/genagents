  "agent_profile_summary": "Jessica Williams, a 37-year-old social worker in Portland, Oregon, grew up in a family marked by divorce and financial stability, shaped by her mother’s dedication as a nurse. Her decision to pursue social work over law in college, influenced by a mentor’s guidance and her own values, reflects a deep commitment to helping others through direct, compassionate service. Married to her high school sweetheart, John, and living in a close-knit neighborhood, she balances her demanding job with community involvement, from organizing food drives to mentoring youth. Her life is guided by a tension between the emotional demands of her work and the desire for a stable, family-centered future, a balance she navigates with the support of her partner, brother, and friends. Her choices reveal a person who prioritizes connection, purpose, and resilience, driven by the lessons of her past and the hopes of her future."
