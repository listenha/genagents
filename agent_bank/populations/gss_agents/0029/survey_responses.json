This indicates that she values thoughtful consideration. Additionally, her involvement in community activities and her willingness to take on leadership roles suggests a methodical approach to her endeavors.",
            "REI_9": "Based on Angela's responses, she seems to value community and support systems, indicating a reliance on interpersonal solutions rather than purely logical ones. However, she does have a structured approach to her work and personal life, suggesting some use of logic. Given her background and the emphasis on community, it's likely she leans towards using logic, but not to an extreme extent.",
            "REI_10": "Based on Angela's interview, she seems to be someone who reflects on her past decisions and attributes them to thoughtful considerations. For instance, she mentions that her decision to attend a private university was influenced by guidance from her guidance counselor and mother, suggesting that she often thinks through her choices. However, she also acknowledges that some decisions felt like they just happened, indicating that she might not always have a fully explainable reason. Given this balance, a score of 3 seems most appropriate, but leaning slightly towards 4 as she does reflect on her decisions, even if they aren't always fully explainable."

She engages in community meetings, events, and social activities with friends.

She focuses more on her career and community involvement, suggesting she might not identify herself as highly artistic. However, given her detailed descriptions of her community and work life, it's possible she has some level of artistic interest that she hasn't explicitly mentioned.

While she doesn't mention specific struggles with problem-solving in her narrative, her overall resilience and willingness to take on new challenges suggest she is capable of handling complex issues. However, the statement focuses on a general inability to figure out complicated problems, which might not align perfectly with her demonstrated ability to make important life decisions and pursue higher education. Therefore, she is more likely to fall somewhere in the middle, acknowledging some difficulty but not entirely agreeing with the statement.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Angela has shown a mix of resilience and pragmatism in her life. She faced significant financial and personal challenges but managed to achieve educational and professional success. Her description suggests a pragmatic approach to problem-solving rather than an analytical one.

She has also expressed a willingness to take risks and make decisions without always having all the information, as seen in her decision to attend a private university despite the financial burden.

            "REI_5": "Based on Angela's interview, she has faced numerous challenges and pressures, such as financial difficulties, work deadlines, and community initiatives. However, she mentions that she manages stress through mindfulness, setting realistic goals, and journaling. This suggests she has developed strategies to cope with pressure. While she acknowledges that the upcoming project deadlines and new community initiative are causing her some stress, she seems capable of handling it with her current coping mechanisms.

            "REI_7": "Based on Angela's responses, she seems to be someone who values hard work, perseverance, and community involvement. While she doesn't explicitly mention having a strong logical mind, her career in marketing and her willingness to take on new challenges suggest she likely possesses some analytical skills.

            "REI_10": "Based on Angela's responses, she seems to be someone who values thoughtful consideration and has a history of making decisions that are backed by reasoning and guidance. She described how significant decisions in her life, like choosing to attend a private university, were influenced by her guidance counselor and mother, indicating that she tends to weigh her options and seek clarity before making important choices.
