  "agent_profile_summary": "Angela Hoffman, a 40-year-old marketing coordinator in Milwaukee, grew up in a working-class family in the East North Central region, where her mother’s resilience after her father’s death shaped her early understanding of perseverance. A pivotal moment came when she chose to take a scholarship to a private university over a free community college, a decision that led to student loans but also to a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration and a stable career. Now, she balances her full-time job with community involvement, volunteering with underprivileged children and participating in environmental initiatives. Her life is guided by a commitment to giving back, rooted in the support she received from her mother and mentors. Though she navigates financial challenges and the pressures of work, Angela remains focused on building a stronger future, both for herself and her community, with a quiet determination that reflects her journey from hardship to purpose."
