Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nDavid Lee: I was born in Shanghai, China, but I moved to the United States with my family when I was about five years old. We settled in Seattle, Washington, where I grew up. My parents didn't have a lot of formal education\u2014my father only finished middle school, and my mother didn't finish high school either. But they worked hard, especially my mother, who took on multiple jobs to support our family. I remember growing up in a small apartment, and we didn't have much, but we had love and a strong sense of family. I was always encouraged to study and do well in school, even if they didn't have the means to provide me with many resources. I went to public school, and I was pretty good at math and science. I ended up going to college on a scholarship, and later I earned a graduate degree in engineering. I've been working full time for the past ten years, and I'm married now with two kids. Life hasn't always been easy, but I've always believed in working hard and making the most of the opportunities I've had.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nDavid Lee: Yes, there was definitely a crossroads. I was about 18, right after finishing high school, and I had two options: go to a local community college or take a job at a manufacturing plant that offered to hire me on the spot. My parents were struggling financially, and they really needed the income. I felt torn because I knew the job would provide stability, but I also knew that if I didn't go to college, I might be stuck in that same cycle of limited opportunities. I remember talking to my mother late one night, and she said something that stuck with me: 'If you don't take this chance, you might regret it for the rest of your life.' That night, I decided to go to community college. It wasn't easy\u2014working part-time while going to school, sometimes staying up late to study, but I made it through. I eventually transferred to a four-year university and earned my degree. That decision shaped everything that came after, and I've never looked back.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nDavid Lee: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made easily. I had to weigh the immediate needs of my family against the long-term possibilities for myself. In the end, I realized that while I couldn't control the circumstances I was born into, I could control the decisions I made. That moment taught me the value of education and the importance of thinking beyond the present. It wasn't just about me\u2014it was about the future I wanted for my family too. I made the choice, and it was the right one, even though it wasn't the easy one.\n\n",

I remember talking to a teacher at my high school, Mr. Chen, who saw potential in me even when I didn't see it in myself. He encouraged me to apply for scholarships and even helped me write my application essays. Without his support, I might not have had the confidence to pursue college. There were also local organizations that offered tutoring and mentorship programs for students from low-income families. I think if more people and organizations had reached out to kids like me, it could have made a huge difference. It wasn't just about money\u2014it was about having someone believe in you and show you a path forward.\n\n",

We got married right after we graduated, and we've been together for over ten years now. We have two kids: a daughter, Lily, who's eight, and a son, Ethan, who's five. They're both bilingual, speaking both English and Mandarin, which I think is really important for them to connect with their heritage. Mei works part-time as a translator, which helps support our family, and I work full-time as a civil engineer. We live in the same neighborhood I grew up in, which feels like a full circle in a way. It's not always easy balancing work and family life, especially with two kids, but we make it work. Mei and I have a strong partnership, and we both believe in working hard and providing the best for our children.

My father, although he didn't have much formal education, has always been a hard worker. He retired from a factory job a few years ago, but he still helps out around the house and keeps busy with gardening and fixing things. My mother, on the other hand, has always been the heart of our family. She's the one who kept us going through tough times, and even now, she's always there to offer advice or help with the kids. Our relationship is very close, and I try to spend as much time with them as I can. They've sacrificed so much for my brother and me, and I want them to know how grateful I am. My brother, Jason, is a few years older than me, and he's living in San Francisco now. He works in IT and has a family of his own. We don't see each other as often as we'd like, but we stay in touch.

One of them is Sarah, who was my roommate in college. She's a nurse now, and she's been a great support system for me, especially when I was starting out in my career. We've been friends for over 20 years, and even though we don't see each other as often as we'd like, we stay in touch through calls and messages. Another person who's had a big impact on my life is my wife's best friend, Rachel. She's been like a sister to me, and she's always there with advice or just a listening ear.

There are a mix of old and new buildings, lots of cafes, parks, and community centers. It's a pretty walkable area, and I like that I can walk to work or take a short bus ride if I need to. The community here is very supportive, and there are a lot of local events and festivals throughout the year that bring people together.

On the positive side, the community feels like a second family. There are always neighbors who stop by to check on us, especially when we're busy with the kids or working late. The schools are great, and I've seen my kids grow up in an environment that values education and creativity. But there are challenges too. The cost of living is high, and sometimes it feels like we're constantly balancing budgets\u2014whether it's for groceries, extracurricular activities for the kids, or even just keeping up with the bills. I also miss the quiet of the suburbs sometimes, where you can hear birds chirping instead of the constant hum of traffic. But overall, I think the pros outweigh the cons. I love that my kids have access to so many opportunities, and that I can walk to work or grab a cup of coffee at one of the local cafes. It's a busy life, but it's a life I'm proud of.\n\n",

I work as a civil engineer, so my days can be long and sometimes unpredictable. I'm often on site or in meetings, but I try to leave work around 6 or 7 p.m. to be home for dinner.

On the flip side, my son, Ethan, has started kindergarten, and that's brought a new rhythm to our mornings. We've had to get up earlier and streamline our routines so we can get him out the door on time. It's been a bit of a learning curve, but I've found that these changes have brought us closer as a family. I also started taking evening walks with my wife a few times a week to decompress after the kids are in bed.

It wasn't anything serious, but I did sprain it slightly during a game, and it took a few weeks to heal properly. I had to take a break from running for a while, which was tough because I rely on that as a way to clear my mind. I saw a physical therapist for a couple of sessions, and they helped me strengthen the muscles around my knee to prevent future issues. It was a reminder that even small injuries can disrupt your routine, but it also made me more mindful of warming up properly and listening to my body. Other than that, I haven't had any major health issues. I've been pretty consistent with my check-ups, and my doctor says I'm in good shape for my age. It's funny, though\u2014I think that injury made me realize how important it is to take care of myself, not just for my kids, but for me too.

There were a few days where I felt frustrated because I couldn't run or lift weights like I normally do, and I worried it might affect my work or my ability to keep up with the kids. But I realized that taking a step back wasn't a weakness\u2014it was a necessary part of recovery.

With the kids growing up so fast, it's amazing how quickly time passes. I've been trying to be more present, whether it's during dinner conversations, bedtime stories, or just sitting quietly with my wife after the kids are asleep. I think the pandemic really made me realize how important it is to cherish the little moments. I've also been reflecting a lot on my own journey\u2014how far I've come from that small apartment in Seattle, and how much my parents' sacrifices have shaped who I am today. There's a sense of responsibility I feel, not just as a father and husband, but as someone who wants to set a good example for my kids. I've been trying to balance that with being my own person, pursuing my interests, and making sure I don't lose myself in the chaos of everyday life. It's not always easy, but I'm learning to be kinder to myself and to find joy in the everyday things\u2014like a good cup of coffee, a walk in the park, or even just a quiet moment with my family.\n\n",

How about for you?\n\nDavid Lee: Honestly, I've had my share of tough moments, especially when I was younger and feeling the pressure of balancing work, family, and my own self-doubt. There were times when I felt overwhelmed, especially during those long nights working on projects or helping the kids with homework while trying to keep my own head above water. I think the biggest challenge for me has been managing stress without letting it consume me. I used to push through everything on my own, thinking that showing weakness was a sign of failure. But over the years, I've learned that it's okay to ask for help, whether it's from my wife, friends, or even a therapist. I've started talking more openly about how I feel, and that's helped me feel less isolated. I still have days when I feel anxious or down, but I've developed coping strategies\u2014like taking time for myself, staying active, and reminding myself of the progress I've made. I think the key is not to ignore those feelings but to face them head-on and find healthy ways to deal with them. I'm not perfect, but I'm learning, and that's what matters most.\n\n",

She's been amazing, as always, but I can tell she's been stretched thin at times. The kids, too, have been going through their own changes\u2014Lily is more independent now, which is great, but also means she's starting to push boundaries, and Ethan is becoming more curious about the world around him. We've had our share of late nights and early mornings, but I think we've all learned to lean on each other more than ever. There were moments when I worried about how we'd keep up with everything, but I've come to realize that it's not about perfection\u2014it's about showing up for each other, even when life feels overwhelming.

Growing up, my family didn't practice any specific faith, and I never felt a need to fill that void with something formal. Instead, I've found my sense of purpose and meaning in the values my parents instilled in me\u2014hard work, family, and education. I think of my parents' sacrifices as a kind of spiritual foundation, a quiet but powerful force that guides me. I also find meaning in the small, everyday moments: the way my kids laugh, the way my wife and I support each other, or even the way the neighborhood feels like home. I don't think of it as spirituality in the traditional sense, but I do believe in something bigger than myself, something that connects us all. I guess I'm more of a believer in the human spirit and the power of love and resilience.\n\n",

I find that it can be a bit overwhelming with all the noise and comparisons, and I've always preferred more personal, face-to-face connections. That said, I do use Facebook occasionally to stay in touch with family and old friends, especially those who live far away like my brother in San Francisco.

I think it's important to stay connected, but I've learned that I don't need to be constantly online to feel part of the world.

When things got really tough, like when I was deciding whether to go to college or take the job, it was my mom's words and the support from teachers like Mr. Chen that helped me through. I think social media can be a tool, but it's not the same as having someone right there, face-to-face, who truly understands what you're going through.

There are days when I feel like I'm constantly running between tasks, and I worry I'm not giving enough attention to any one thing. But I've been working on developing better coping strategies. One thing that's helped is setting aside specific times to unwind\u2014whether it's a quiet evening walk with Mei, reading a book, or even just sitting on the porch and watching the kids play. I've also started journaling more, which has been a great way to process my thoughts and emotions. I used to think that stress was something I had to push through on my own, but I've come to realize that it's okay to take a step back and take care of myself. I've also leaned more on my support system\u2014talking to Mei, my friends, or even just taking a few deep breaths when things feel overwhelming.

Lily's middle school has a lot of extracurricular fees\u2014soccer, homework club, and even some field trips. Ethan's music lessons and the reading support group also add up. Then there's the cost of groceries, which has been a bit higher than usual because we've been trying to eat healthier and include more organic options. Utilities and car payments are also regular expenses, and with the cost of living in Seattle, those can be a strain. I also set aside money for savings and emergencies, which is something I've been really focused on lately. It's not always easy to track every dollar, but I try to be as mindful as possible. Mei and I have a budget spreadsheet that we update weekly, and we make sure to review it together to stay on top of things. It's a balancing act, but I think it's important to plan ahead so we can provide the best for our kids without sacrificing our own well-being.\n\n",

Typically, we hover around $4,800 to $5,200 per month. The increase this time was mostly due to Lily's school having a special field trip that required a fee, and we also had to replace the family car's tires, which we hadn't planned for. On a regular month, our biggest expenses are the kids' activities, groceries, utilities, and car payments. We also set aside money for savings, and I try to contribute to a college fund for the kids, even if it's a small amount each month. It's not always easy to stick to the budget, especially when unexpected things come up, but Mei and I have gotten pretty good at adjusting and prioritizing what's most important.

We've been in the same building for about five years, and the landlord is pretty understanding. It's a good neighborhood, and I feel like we're in a stable situation.

Tell me all about how your bills have fluctuated over the past year.\n\nDavid Lee: Over the past year, our bills have definitely fluctuated, especially with the seasons and the kids' schedules. For example, during the winter months, our utility bills\u2014especially heating\u2014went up a bit, which was a noticeable change from the milder fall and spring months. We also had higher grocery expenses around the holidays, like Thanksgiving and Christmas, when we tend to cook bigger meals and buy more snacks for the kids. School-related costs also vary\u2014when the kids are in session, we have more fees for activities and supplies, but during summer, those drop off, though we end up spending more on things like summer camps or family trips. Another thing that affected our budget was the timing of our car maintenance. We had to replace the tires in the middle of the year, which wasn't in our regular monthly plan, so that added a bit of unexpected expense. Overall, I've learned to be more flexible with our budget and to set aside a little extra each month for these kinds of surprises. It's not always perfect, but it helps us stay afloat without getting too stressed about it.\n\n",

It also brought up how I don't rely on social media for support, but instead on the real, meaningful connections I have with the people I love. I'm grateful for the support system I've built and for the lessons I've learned about resilience, balance, and the importance of being present for the people who matter most.",

I earn a salary as a civil engineer, and Mei works part-time as a translator, which helps cover some of our expenses. While it's not a huge amount, it's enough to manage our bills, save a little, and provide for the kids. I've always believed that financial stability comes from a combination of hard work, smart planning, and being mindful of our spending. It's not always easy, especially with the rising cost of living in Seattle, but we've found a way to make it work. I think the most important thing is that we're not living paycheck to paycheck, and we have some savings to fall back on if needed. It's a good balance for us right now, and I'm proud of how we've built a life that's both stable and full of opportunities for our kids.\n\n",

The company offers a solid benefits package, which includes health insurance for me, my wife, and the kids. That's been a huge relief, especially with the rising cost of healthcare. We also get paid time off, including vacation days, sick leave, and a few personal days, which is important for maintaining a work-life balance. I've taken advantage of the vacation days to plan family trips, like a camping trip to Olympic National Park last summer, which was a great way to disconnect and recharge. The company also offers some professional development opportunities, like workshops and courses that help us stay updated on the latest engineering practices. I've taken a few of those, which has been helpful in advancing my career. Overall, I feel lucky to be in a stable position that supports both my family and my professional growth.\n\n",

He's supportive and understands the demands of balancing work with family life, which is something I really appreciate. He's given me the freedom to manage my time in a way that works for me, as long as I meet the project deadlines. As for my coworkers, we get along well\u2014there's a good mix of people with different backgrounds and experiences, which makes the workplace environment dynamic and collaborative. I've been lucky to work with some really talented engineers who are not only skilled but also passionate about what they do. We often have lunch together or grab coffee after work, which helps build a sense of camaraderie. I think the key to having good relationships at work is mutual respect and communication, and I've always tried to embody that.

Most days, I start around 7:30 a.m. and work until 6 or 7 p.m., which gives me enough time to be home for dinner with the kids. I do have some flexibility, especially when it comes to arriving at the office or leaving a bit earlier if I need to pick up the kids from school or attend a family event. That said, there are times when the schedule gets less predictable, especially when we're working on tight deadlines or dealing with unexpected issues on a project. For example, if there's a problem with a construction site or a change in city regulations, I might need to stay late or come in early to address it. I appreciate the flexibility my job offers, but I also value the structure it provides, especially with my family life. It's a balance, but one that I've learned to manage over the years.\n\n",

Even though the work was physically demanding and the pay wasn't great, he always showed up on time and gave his best effort.
