Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMai Nguyen: I was born in San Jose, California, to parents who both grew up in Vietnam. We moved here when I was just a baby, and I've always considered the U.S. my home, even though I carry a deep connection to my heritage. My childhood was pretty typical\u2014my parents worked hard to provide for our family, and I grew up in a close-knit neighborhood where everyone knew each other. I lived with my parents and my younger brother until I went to college. My mom worked as a nurse, and my dad was a mechanic, both of them having only finished high school. Despite their limited education, they always encouraged me to pursue my dreams. I was the first in my family to go to college, and I ended up earning a graduate degree in social work. It wasn't an easy path\u2014there were times when money was tight, and I had to work part-time while studying, but I always felt supported by my family. I married my husband, who's also Vietnamese, and we've built a life together here in San Jose. We have two kids, and I still work full-time, though I've made it a priority to be there for them as much as possible. Life has had its challenges, but I've always believed in the value of education, hard work, and family.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMai Nguyen: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped my path. When I was in my second year of college, I had the opportunity to work as a volunteer at a local community center that provided support services to immigrants and low-income families. At the time, I was struggling to balance my studies, a part-time job, and taking care of my younger brother while my parents were working late shifts. But that experience at the community center opened my eyes to the challenges many families face, especially those like mine who had recently immigrated. I saw how much of a difference someone could make by being there for others, and it made me realize that I wanted to dedicate my career to helping people in similar situations. I decided to switch my major to social work, even though it meant starting over with some courses and taking on more debt. It was a tough decision, but looking back, I know it was the right one. That crossroads taught me the importance of using my education not just for personal success, but to give back to the community that raised me.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nMai Nguyen: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made lightly. It felt like the universe was nudging me in that direction. I remember sitting in my dorm room one night, looking at the photos of my parents and my brother, and thinking about how far we had come. I realized that if I had the chance to make a difference in someone else's life, even in a small way, I had a responsibility to do so. It wasn't just about my own dreams anymore\u2014it was about the legacy I wanted to leave for my family and the community that had given me so much. I made the decision that night, and I've never regretted it.\n\n",

I remember that the community center I volunteered at had a mentorship program, and one of the social workers there, Ms. Lin, took me under her wing. She shared her own story of growing up in a similar situation and how she found her way into social work. Her guidance was invaluable\u2014it helped me see the path more clearly and gave me the confidence to make the switch. I also had support from my parents, who, even though they didn't fully understand what social work entailed, believed in me and encouraged me to follow my heart. I think it's important to recognize that no one does it alone. There were people who saw potential in me and offered support when I needed it most.\n\n",

My husband, Minh, is also Vietnamese, and we met in college through a mutual friend. He works as an IT specialist, and while our careers are different, we share a deep respect for each other's dedication and hard work. We have a daughter, Lily, who's eight, and a son, Ethan, who's five. Raising them in San Jose has been both a blessing and a challenge. I want them to grow up with a strong sense of their Vietnamese heritage, so we celebrate our traditions, speak Vietnamese at home, and take them to cultural events whenever we can. At the same time, I want them to feel comfortable in their American identity. It's a balance, but I think they're doing well. My parents are still very involved in their lives, and I'm grateful for that. My mother helps with the kids a few days a week, and my father, though he's not as active as he used to be, still enjoys spending time with them. Family is everything to me, and I'm so proud of the life we've built together.\n\n",

He ended up going into the restaurant business, owning a small Vietnamese eatery in San Jose. It's been a dream of his for years, and I'm so proud of him for making it happen. We don't see each other as often as I'd like because of our busy schedules, but whenever we do, it's like no time has passed. He's always been the fun-loving one, the one who keeps our family laughing, and I know I can always count on him.

One of them is Sarah, a childhood friend from our neighborhood. We grew up together, and even though we've both taken different paths in life, we still keep in touch. She's a teacher now, and she's always been someone I can talk to about anything\u2014whether it's about work, family, or just life in general. She's been there for me through some of my toughest times, and I know I can always rely on her. Then there's my friend David, who I met through the community center where I volunteered.

He's helped me navigate some of the challenges in my career and has always encouraged me to keep pushing forward.

It's in San Jose, near the downtown area, but still has that community feel that I remember from when I was growing up. There are a lot of Vietnamese families here, which makes me feel at home, but there are also a lot of other cultures represented, which I love. The streets are lined with small businesses, from local bakeries to family-owned restaurants, and every weekend, there are cultural festivals and food markets that bring everyone together. I enjoy walking around the neighborhood, especially on weekends, because it's full of life and energy. There's a community garden nearby where I sometimes volunteer, and it's a nice way to connect with other residents.

The local Vietnamese community is very supportive, and I've made lifelong friends here.

I also started a small habit of journaling in the morning, just a few sentences about how I'm feeling or what I'm grateful for.

Tell me all about how you have been feeling.\n\nMai Nguyen: Over the past year, I've had a lot of mixed emotions. On one hand, I've been really grateful for the progress I've made in my health after the surgery. I'm able to walk longer distances without pain, and I've even started going to yoga classes again, which has been a huge relief. I feel more energized and connected to my body, which has helped me be more present for my kids and my work. On the other hand, there have been moments of uncertainty, especially with the ongoing challenges of the pandemic and the rising cost of living. I've had to make some tough decisions, like cutting back on certain expenses or working extra hours to make ends meet. It's been a year of resilience, but also of learning to be more flexible with my expectations. I've also been reflecting a lot on my role as a mother and a community worker, and I've come to appreciate how much I give to others, but also how important it is to take time for myself. I've started setting aside small moments each day just for me\u2014whether it's reading a book, listening to music, or even just sitting quietly with a cup of tea. It's not much, but it's helped me feel more balanced and grounded.\n\n",

It was a humbling reminder that taking care of my body is just as important as taking care of my family and my work. I also realized how much my support system\u2014my family, friends, and even my community\u2014helps me stay grounded and resilient.

It's okay to not be okay sometimes. I've also started practicing mindfulness more regularly, which has helped me manage my thoughts and emotions. I'm not saying I've completely conquered anxiety, but I'm learning to live with it and not let it define me.

I attend Mass every Sunday when I can, and I find that the sense of community in the church is something I really value.

My faith has helped me through some of my toughest moments, especially during my recovery from surgery and the stress of work.

I want my kids to know about our faith, not just as a tradition, but as a way to find meaning and hope in life.

I also follow some local community pages that post about cultural events, school activities, and volunteer opportunities. It's a good way to stay connected with what's happening in our area without having to leave the house. I don't use Instagram or other platforms as much because I find them a bit overwhelming with all the constant updates and comparisons.

It's also where I keep track of my parents' health and make sure I don't miss any important family events.

When I was recovering from my surgery, I posted a few updates about how I was feeling, and to my surprise, a lot of people from my community reached out with messages of encouragement or even shared their own stories of recovery. It was comforting to know that I wasn't alone in my struggles, and it reminded me of the power of connection, even through a screen.

It's not the same as being there in person, but it's a way to stay close and show support, especially when life gets busy.

I've been trying to be more intentional with how I handle stress. I've started journaling more regularly, not just in the mornings but also at night, which helps me process my thoughts and emotions. I've also found that spending time in nature, even if it's just a short walk in the park, helps me reset. I've been more open with my family about my feelings too, which has created a deeper sense of connection. My husband and I have started having weekly check-ins where we talk about how we're feeling, and that's been really healing.

Both Lily and Ethan are in after-school programs, and those fees add up, especially with Lily's piano lessons and Ethan's soccer team. We also had to pay for some dental checkups and a few prescriptions after my surgery.

Normally, we spend closer to $3,000 a month, but with the cost of living rising and some unexpected expenses, like the dental visits and a new pair of shoes for Ethan after he outgrew his old ones, it added up. Our biggest fixed costs are rent, which is about $1,500, and car payments and insurance, which total around $600. Then there's the groceries, which we try to keep under $500, but with two kids and my work schedule, it's not always easy. The after-school activities and piano lessons are another recurring expense\u2014around $300 a month. I've been trying to track everything more carefully, and we've cut back on things like eating out or buying new clothes unless it's necessary.

For example, during the school year, we have more expenses related to after-school activities, like Lily's piano lessons and Ethan's soccer team. We also pay for school supplies, uniforms, and sometimes even transportation passes for them. In the summer, those costs go down a bit, but we end up spending more on things like summer camps or family trips.

That comes from my full-time salary as a social worker and my husband's income as an IT specialist. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our basic needs and some of our monthly expenses. I've been trying to be more mindful of how we spend our money, especially with the rising cost of living. We've had to make some tough choices, like cutting back on dining out or delaying non-essential purchases, but I feel good about the balance we've struck. I'm also grateful that my parents help out with the kids sometimes, which eases some of the financial pressure. It's not always easy, but I believe we're doing our best to provide for our family and build a stable future for our children.\n\n",

(This could include things like health benefits, paid time off, vacation, and sick time.)\n\nMai Nguyen: I've been working at Community Bridges for about seven years now, and it's become such a big part of my life. The benefits of the job are pretty standard for a nonprofit\u2014health insurance is one of the most important things, especially after my surgery. I have access to medical, dental, and vision coverage, which has been a huge relief. We also get paid time off, including vacation days and sick leave, which is something I really appreciate because it allows me to take care of myself and my family when needed. There's also a small stipend for professional development, which I've used to attend workshops on trauma-informed care and cultural competency. I think it's important for social workers to keep learning, especially when working with such a diverse population. The workplace itself is pretty supportive, and I've built strong relationships with my colleagues. We often have team meetings where we share experiences and support each other through the challenges of the job. It's not always easy, but I feel like I'm part of something bigger than myself, and that gives me a sense of purpose every day.\n\n",

She's always been approachable, whether it's for guidance, feedback, or just a listening ear when things get overwhelming. I feel like she genuinely cares about her team and our well-being, which makes a huge difference in such a demanding job. As for my coworkers, we've built a strong sense of camaraderie over the years. We often share stories, support each other through tough cases, and even have lunch breaks together when we can. There's a real sense of community in our office, and I think that's one of the reasons I've been able to stay committed to this work for so long.

I usually start at 8:30 a.m. and finish by 5 p.m., but there are days when I stay a bit later to wrap up a case or attend a meeting. I also have the option to work from home a couple of days a week, which has been helpful, especially when I need to manage family responsibilities or take care of myself. That said, I don't always know exactly what my day will look like when I wake up\u2014sometimes I'm in the office, sometimes I'm out visiting clients, and other times I'm on the phone with a colleague or a client.

My husband and I both work hard, and we've built a life that's stable enough to provide for our kids and keep a roof over our heads.

It wasn't easy for them\u2014especially in the beginning, when they were just trying to establish themselves in this country.

I always tell my kids that their grandparents didn't have much, but they gave everything they had to make sure we had a better life.
