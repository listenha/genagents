  "agent_profile_summary": "Mai Nguyen, a 37-year-old social worker in San Jose, California, grew up in a close-knit Vietnamese-American family and is the first in her lineage to earn a graduate degree. Her decision to switch from her initial college major to social work, driven by a volunteer experience at a community center, marked a pivotal shift toward a career dedicated to supporting immigrant families, a cause deeply rooted in her own family's journey. She balances her full-time job with raising two children, maintaining a strong connection to her heritage through language and traditions, while also embracing her American identity. Her life is shaped by a commitment to community, resilience in the face of financial and health challenges, and a deep sense of gratitude for the support of her family and neighbors. Mai’s choices reflect a steady path from personal struggle to service, guided by the values of compassion and family that were instilled in her from a young age."
