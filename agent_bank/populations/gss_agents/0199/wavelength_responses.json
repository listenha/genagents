Growing up in a Vietnamese-American community, I've seen how beauty is interpreted differently across cultures and how it's often tied to emotions, memories, and values. My own experiences with family, heritage, and community have shown me that what one person finds beautiful may not resonate the same with another. However, I do acknowledge that there are some universal elements to beauty, so I place it closer to the subjective side but not entirely at 100."

Dinosaurs did not lead to modern civilization, nor were they part of a linear progression. Instead, their extinction was a random occurrence that allowed for the rise of mammals and, eventually, humans.

While it might suggest a moment of connection or comfort in a new place, the imagery of candlelight often carries a nostalgic or sentimental tone. Given my own experiences of balancing a deep connection to my Vietnamese heritage with life in the U.S., I associate candlelight with moments of reflection on home, even in a new city.
