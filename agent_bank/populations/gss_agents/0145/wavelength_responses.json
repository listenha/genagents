While basic math is indeed simple, the subject as a whole is often seen as challenging and intricate, especially when applied to real-world problems or advanced fields.

My Korean heritage also shapes my appreciation for certain aesthetics, like traditional art or nature, which may not be universally recognized as beautiful.

It could symbolize a quiet, intimate moment in a city that is unfamiliar, which might evoke a mix of wonder and a subtle yearning for home. While there's an element of exploring a new city, the mention of 'candle light' suggests a personal, introspective moment that might lean toward homesickness.

However, based on my personal experiences and values, I believe most horror movies fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum—scary enough to be engaging but not so overwhelming that they cause panic.
