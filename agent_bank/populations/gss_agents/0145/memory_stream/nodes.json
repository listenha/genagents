    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nSunhee Kim: I was born in Los Angeles, but I grew up in a small town in the Pacific region, where my parents had moved for work. My childhood was pretty typical for someone from a middle-class family\u2014my parents both had bachelor's degrees, and while we weren't wealthy, we were never lacking for love or support. My mom worked as a teacher, and my dad was in engineering. They always encouraged me to pursue my education, which I did. I went to a public school, and I was pretty good at math and science, but I also loved literature and writing. I remember staying up late reading novels and writing stories in my journal. I moved to Irvine when I was 16, and while I missed the small-town feel, I adapted quickly. I went to college here, got my bachelor's degree in business administration, and eventually found a job in marketing. I met my husband during a volunteer event at a local church, and we got married a few years later. Life has been busy, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. I speak Korean at home with my parents, and I still keep in touch with my old friends from the Pacific. I like to think I've built a life that's both stable and full of opportunities.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nSunhee Kim: Yes, there was a moment that really shaped my path. After I graduated from high school, I had two main options: attend a local community college or move to a bigger city for a more competitive university. I was torn because I wanted to stay close to my family and friends, but I also knew that if I wanted to build a career in business, I needed to be in a place with more opportunities. I ended up choosing to move to Irvine for college, which was a big step for me. It wasn't easy\u2014adjusting to a new city, making new friends, and balancing school with part-time work was challenging. But I remember one specific moment during my first semester when I was sitting in a business class, and the professor asked us to think about our long-term goals. I realized then that I didn't want to be stuck in a small town with limited options. That moment pushed me to work harder, get involved in campus activities, and eventually land an internship that led to my first full-time job. It was a crossroads, and choosing to move forward with courage was the best decision I ever made.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nSunhee Kim: I think it was a conscious choice, but not one I made easily. I had a lot of doubts and fears, especially because I was leaving everything familiar behind. But I remember talking to my parents one evening, and my mom said something that stuck with me: 'Sunhee, life is like a river\u2014it doesn't always flow smoothly, but it moves forward.' That gave me the courage to take the leap. I didn't just choose to move to Irvine; I chose to believe in myself and my future. It wasn't just about the opportunities\u2014it was about growing into the person I wanted to be. And looking back, I know that decision was the foundation of who I am today.\n\n",

My high school guidance counselor, Ms. Park, was someone who really believed in me when I wasn't sure I believed in myself. She sat down with me during my junior year and talked about the importance of thinking beyond the immediate comfort zone. She even helped me apply for scholarships and connect with mentors at local businesses. Without her support, I might have stayed in the Pacific and never considered moving to Irvine. Also, my church community played a role. When I was struggling with the decision, the pastor invited me to lead a youth discussion group, which gave me confidence in my ability to lead and communicate. Those people and organizations didn't just help me make the move\u2014they helped me grow into the person I needed to become.\n\n",

David works in IT, and while our careers are different, we both value hard work and family. We live in a quiet neighborhood in Irvine, and I enjoy being close to my in-laws as well. My parents still live in the Pacific, and we make it a point to visit them at least once a year. Family has always been important to me, and I try to instill that value in Sophia.

The crossroads I faced after high school was a pivotal moment that tested my courage and belief in myself, and it's amazing how that decision set the foundation for who I am today. I'm grateful for the guidance I received from people like my high school counselor and my church community, who helped me take that leap of faith.

He's always been the adventurous one in our family\u2014while I was the one who stayed up late reading, he was the one who would climb trees and ride his bike down hills without a helmet. He's now a graphic designer in San Francisco, and though we don't see each other as often as I'd like, we keep in close contact through calls and video chats. Our relationship has always been filled with teasing and inside jokes, but there's a deep respect there too. He was the one who encouraged me to take risks when I was younger, and I think that influence helped me make the decision to move to Irvine. Even now, he's one of the first people I call when I'm facing a big decision.

One of them is Lisa, who I met in college. We were in the same business club, and she became one of my closest friends. Lisa is a marketing strategist now, and she's always been the one to push me to think creatively and take on new challenges. Even though we're both busy with our careers, we still make time for each other\u2014whether it's grabbing coffee or planning weekend trips. There's also my college roommate, Emily, who I haven't talked about much. She moved back to her hometown after graduation, but we stay in touch. She's the one who introduced me to the idea of traveling more, and we've been planning a trip to Japan for the past two years.

It's a mix of families, professionals, and retirees, which gives the area a really warm and welcoming vibe. Our street, Ocean View Drive, is close to a local park where Sophia loves to play on the swings and slide. I also appreciate how walkable the neighborhood is\u2014there are plenty of cafes, grocery stores, and even a small library within a few blocks. What I love most about living here is the balance between being close to the city's opportunities and still having the peace and safety of a suburban feel. It's a place where I can feel grounded, and I think it's helped us build a stable life for our family. Plus, being near the beach is a bonus\u2014on weekends, David and I like to take Sophia to the shore for a picnic or a walk along the water.

I've never felt uneasy walking around, even after dark. There are community events throughout the year, like the local farmers' market and holiday festivals, which bring everyone together. I think the safety here is more than just the physical aspect; it's the feeling of belonging and trust that makes this place feel secure.

On the positive side, the sense of community and the safety of the neighborhood have made it easy for us to build a stable life for our family. I love that Sophia can ride her bike around the block without me worrying about her safety, and that I can walk to the park or the grocery store without hesitation. The local schools are also excellent, which gives me peace of mind about her future. That said, living in a suburban area does have its challenges. Sometimes, I feel like the pace of life here is a bit slower than what I'm used to, especially with my career in marketing, where things can move quickly. There are also moments when I miss the cultural diversity of the city\u2014like the bustling Korean markets or the vibrant street food scene. But I've learned to find balance.

I drop her off and head to the office, where I work as a marketing manager for a mid-sized tech company. My days are usually filled with meetings, strategy sessions, and managing a team of five.

About a year ago, I started experiencing some persistent back pain, which I initially thought was just from sitting at my desk too long. But after a few months of discomfort, I finally made an appointment with my doctor. It turned out that I had developed a herniated disc in my lower back, likely from years of poor posture and not taking enough breaks during long work hours. The doctor recommended physical therapy, which I started immediately. I also had to adjust my workspace to be more ergonomic\u2014adding a standing desk and a supportive chair made a huge difference. It was a bit of a setback, but it also became a turning point for me. I started prioritizing movement more, like taking short walks during the day and even joining a local fitness class for beginners. The pain has mostly subsided now, and I feel much stronger.

It reminded me that health isn't just about being strong or independent; it's also about knowing when to slow down and let others support you. Now, I'm more mindful of how my body feels, and I try to listen to it before it becomes a bigger issue. It's not perfect, but I'm grateful for the lesson it taught me about balance, self-compassion, and the importance of a strong support system.\n\n",

I think the biggest thing that's changed for me is how I approach challenges. After dealing with the back pain and learning to slow down, I've become more intentional about how I spend my time and energy. I've also noticed that Sophia is growing up so fast, and I find myself cherishing every moment with her more than ever. There's a sense of peace in knowing that we've created a stable, loving home for her, even as life continues to change. I've also been more reflective about my own goals and what I want for the future. I'm thinking about maybe going back to school for a master's degree in marketing, something I've always wanted to do but never had the time for. It's exciting but also a bit daunting.

There were days when I felt overwhelmed by the demands of work, family, and trying to stay healthy all at once. But I've learned to recognize those feelings and not let them define me.

It's not just about going to services or following rules\u2014it's about the values I was taught growing up, like kindness, humility, and the importance of community. My church family has been there for me through every major life event, from my wedding to Sophia's birth. Even now, when life gets overwhelming, I find comfort in prayer and scripture. I also try to live out my faith in practical ways, like volunteering or being there for others when they need support. I think spirituality is about more than just belief\u2014it's about how you show up in the world and treat the people around you.

I have a Facebook account where I keep in touch with my parents, my brother, and some of my old friends from the Pacific. I also use Instagram, but mostly to share little moments from Sophia's day\u2014like her first steps, her favorite drawings, or just her smiling at something silly.

For me, it's more about staying connected with the people I already care about rather than seeking out strangers for support. That said, there were a few times when I posted about my back pain or the challenges of being a working mom, and I was surprised by how many people reached out with encouragement or even shared their own stories. It wasn't the kind of support I would have expected, but it was meaningful in its own way.

But I've started relying more on the coping strategies I've developed over time\u2014like mindfulness, journaling, and talking things through with David or my therapist. I've also found that setting small, achievable goals for myself has helped reduce the feeling of being pulled in too many directions at once.

Our mortgage payment is around $2,500, which covers our home in Woodbridge. Sophia's preschool tuition is another significant expense\u2014about $1,200 a month. We also have a part-time babysitter who helps us out a couple of times a week when we need extra support, which adds another $300 or so. Groceries are always a big part of our budget, especially since I try to cook most of our meals at home, including traditional Korean dishes. That usually comes out to around $800. We also set aside money for car payments, insurance, and savings. I think the most challenging part of managing our budget is balancing the cost of living with the need to save for the future\u2014like Sophia's education or any unexpected expenses. But we've been pretty careful about tracking our spending and making adjustments when needed.

We typically spend about $2,500 on our mortgage, $1,200 on Sophia's preschool, $300 on babysitting, and around $800 on groceries. We also allocate about $600 for car payments and insurance, and we try to set aside at least $1,000 for savings and emergencies.

It's a three-bedroom house in Woodbridge, and it was a big milestone for us when we finally bought it a few years ago.

It was a bit of a challenge at first\u2014saving for the down payment, navigating the mortgage process, and making sure we could afford the monthly payments while still covering Sophia's needs.

For example, during the summer, our electricity bill went up because we used the air conditioning more often, and we also spent a bit more on outdoor activities with Sophia, like buying sunscreen, swim gear, and going to the beach. In the winter, our heating costs increased, and we had to budget more for holiday gifts and family dinners, especially when my parents visited. When school started, Sophia's preschool tuition and supplies became a fixed monthly expense, and we also had to factor in her new backpack, shoes, and school uniforms. On the other hand, during the holidays, we had to set aside extra money for gifts and travel, which sometimes meant cutting back on other areas, like dining out or entertainment. We also had a few unexpected expenses, like a new car tire and a sudden plumbing repair, which reminded us of the importance of having an emergency fund.

Talking about my stress levels and coping strategies reminded me of how important it is to be intentional about my mental health, especially as a working mother. It's not always easy to find balance, but practices like mindfulness, journaling, and leaning on my support system have helped me manage the pressures of work, family, and personal responsibilities. At the same time, discussing our household budget and expenses made me more aware of how financial planning contributes to a sense of security and peace of mind.

That includes my salary as a marketing manager, David's income from his IT job, and any occasional freelance work he does on the side. I think it's important to mention that we also have some passive income from a small investment account we started a few years ago, which helps supplement our monthly earnings. While it's not a huge amount, it gives us a little more financial flexibility, especially when we're planning for things like Sophia's future education or saving for that trip to Japan we've been talking about. I've learned that having multiple streams of income, even if they're small, can make a big difference in feeling more secure about our future. It's not always easy to track everything, but I feel good about the way we're managing our finances and working toward our goals.\n\n",

The benefits package is pretty comprehensive\u2014health insurance covers both my family and me, which is a huge relief, especially after dealing with my back pain. We also get paid time off, including vacation days, sick leave, and even some personal days, which I've found really helpful for managing the balance between work and family. One of the things I appreciate most is the flexibility they offer, like the option to work remotely a few days a week or adjust my schedule when needed for family events. The company also has a wellness program that includes access to fitness classes, mental health resources, and even discounts on healthy food and gym memberships. It's not perfect, but I feel like they genuinely care about their employees' well-being, which makes a big difference in how I approach my work and life.\n\n",

I have a great relationship with my manager, Sarah, who's been a huge support throughout my time here. She's not only professional but also very approachable, and she genuinely cares about her team's growth. She's been the one who encouraged me to take on more leadership responsibilities, like leading our recent product launch, which was a big confidence booster for me. As for my coworkers, we have a good dynamic\u2014most of us get along well, and there's a sense of camaraderie, especially during busy projects. We often have lunch breaks together or grab coffee after work, which helps build that team spirit. I think the key to our good relationships is that we all understand the pressures of the job and support each other when things get tough.

How would you describe your job in terms of flexibility with your hours?\n\nSunhee Kim: My work schedule is pretty predictable, but there's also a good amount of flexibility, which I really appreciate. Most days, I follow a standard 9-to-5 routine, but depending on the project, I might need to adjust my hours. For example, if we're launching a new campaign, I might stay late a few nights or work from home to meet deadlines. On the flip side, if things are slower, I can sometimes leave a bit earlier or take a half-day if needed. The company encourages a healthy work-life balance, so I'm not expected to be in the office every single day. I also have the option to work remotely a couple of days a week, which is helpful when I need to run errands or spend more time with Sophia. That flexibility has been a lifesaver, especially as a working mother, because it allows me to be present for the important moments in my family's life without sacrificing my career. I think the predictability of the schedule gives me a sense of structure, while the flexibility ensures I can adapt when life throws me a curveball.\n\n",

I think the key has been being mindful of our spending, saving consistently, and making sure we're not taking on more debt than we can handle.

My mom was a teacher, and she worked full-time at a local public school, which meant she was often busy with grading, planning lessons, and attending parent-teacher meetings. My dad worked in engineering, and while his job was more flexible, he still had to put in long hours, especially on big projects. I remember seeing them both come home tired after a long day, but they always made time for my brother and me. My mom would often cook dinner while my dad helped with homework or read to us before bed. They didn't have a lot of money, but they always made sure we had what we needed\u2014school supplies, books, and even a few small luxuries like a family trip to Disneyland when I was 12. I think their hard work and sacrifice taught me the value of education and perseverance, and it's something I carry with me to this day. It also made me appreciate the importance of balancing work and family, which is something I try to do with David and Sophia now.\n\n",

She had a passion for literature, and I remember her bringing poetry into the classroom in ways that made it feel alive. She would read aloud and encourage her students to write their own poems, which I think is where I got my love for writing. My dad worked as a civil engineer, and his most important duties involved designing infrastructure projects\u2014like bridges and roads. He was always explaining things to me in simple terms, like how gravity works or why certain materials are used in construction. I remember him taking me to job sites when I was older, and I was fascinated by how he could look at blueprints and visualize the final structure. Both of them had demanding jobs, but they always made time for us, and I think that balance between work and family is something I've tried to carry forward in my own life with David and Sophia.\n\n",

My mom's job involved not only teaching high school English but also mentoring students who were struggling with reading or writing. She often stayed after school to help them, and I remember seeing her grading papers late into the night. My dad, on the other hand, was always on-site at construction projects, overseeing teams of workers and ensuring that blueprints were followed precisely.

While their jobs were very different, both of them had a strong sense of responsibility and dedication to their work.

I also hope to continue growing in my career, maybe even pursuing that master's degree in marketing that I've been thinking about.
