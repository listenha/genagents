  "agent_profile_summary": "Grace Ervin, a 21-year-old from Eugene, Oregon, grew up in a close-knit yet challenging environment after her parents' divorce, with her mother working part-time and attending night school to support the family. At 18, she chose to enroll in community college, a decision that marked a pivotal shift from staying home to exploring new opportunities, leading her to discover a passion for learning and community engagement. Today, she balances online courses with volunteer work, driven by a deep commitment to contributing to her neighborhood and fostering connections through shared values. Her life is shaped by a steady focus on personal growth and service, often navigating the tension between self-care and giving back. Grace approaches life with a grounded perspective, shaped by her mother’s resilience and her own experiences of independence, and she speaks with a quiet determination that reflects her belief in the power of education and community to create meaningful change."
