Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nGrace Ervin: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in the United States, but my parents were Danish immigrants. They met and got married in Oregon when they were in college, but unfortunately, their marriage didn't last. My parents divorced when I was just a baby, and my mom took care of me while she finished her degree. She worked part-time and went to night school to get her high school diploma. Growing up, we lived in Eugene, which is a small city not too far from where I currently live. It's a beautiful place with lots of green space and a great community. My mom did everything she could to give me a good life, even though it wasn't always easy for her financially. I attended a public high school here and graduated with my high school diploma, which is the highest degree I've received so far. I've been keeping house since then, as I'm not currently working outside the home.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nGrace Ervin: One such moment came when I was 18 years old. I had just graduated from high school and was deciding what to do next. On one hand, I could continue staying at home and help my mom, who was still working hard to support us. On the other hand, I felt a strong urge to explore the world and see what else was out there. After much contemplation, I decided to enroll in a community college, planning to take a few courses and see how it went. That decision opened up a whole new chapter in my life. I met people from all walks of life, and I discovered a love for learning that I never knew I had. It also gave me the opportunity to travel a bit during breaks and summer sessions. That experience taught me the importance of stepping out of my comfort zone and trying new things.\n\n",

It wasn't a grand, deliberate plan, but rather a series of small decisions that led to this point. I'm grateful for those moments because they helped shape who I am today.\n\n",

During the summer months, when I had fewer classes and more time for volunteer work, my utility bills were lower because I wasn't heating or cooling the apartment as much. Then, as the fall semester began and I started attending classes more frequently, my electricity and water bills went up a bit.

The challenges and choices I've faced, whether they felt like turning points or simply natural developments, have taught me the importance of stepping out of my comfort zone and embracing new opportunities. The support from my family, especially my mom, has been a constant source of encouragement and resilience. My relationships with friends, mentors, and community members have provided a robust network of support, helping me navigate the complexities of life. Through the ups and downs, I've learned the value of maintaining a balanced routine that supports both my academic and personal goals. Regular exercise, a disciplined study schedule, and engaging in meaningful volunteer work have become integral parts of my daily life, fostering a sense of well-being and fulfillment. Reflecting on this process, I am grateful for the path I've chosen, which has instilled in me a sense of independence, self-reliance, and a deep commitment to making a positive impact in the world around me.",
