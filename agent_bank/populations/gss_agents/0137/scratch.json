  "agent_profile_summary": "Victoria Petrov, a 35-year-old Russian-born resident of Naperville, Illinois, has built a life rooted in cultural connection, faith, and community. Raised in Moscow before moving to the U.S. at six, she left home at 15 for a boarding school in New England, a decision that set her on a path of academic and personal growth. She later studied in Prague on a scholarship, an experience that led her to pursue graduate studies in international relations and a career in nonprofit work focused on cultural exchange. Today, she coordinates community programs that bridge diverse backgrounds, a role she sees as both a calling and a continuation of the values instilled by her mother, a literature teacher, and her father, a mechanic who taught her the value of hard work. Married to Alex, with whom she shares a deep spiritual connection through their Orthodox-Christian faith, Victoria balances her part-time work with family, faith, and a commitment to nurturing her garden and supporting her mother in Russia. Her life reflects a steady journey from seeking knowledge to giving back, shaped by the belief that understanding and compassion can transform communities."
