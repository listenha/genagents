While it may hint at a new experience, the imagery of candlelight often carries a sense of warmth and comfort, which could be associated with homesickness. Given my own experiences of moving from Russia to the U.S. and feeling a mix of excitement and longing, I see this clue as leaning more toward homesickness.
