  "agent_profile_summary": "Tiana Johnson, a 31-year-old social worker in Chicago, was raised in a tight-knit South Side neighborhood where her parents’ careers in education and healthcare instilled in her a deep sense of service and community. After a pivotal decision in college to pursue a career in nonprofit mental health services over a more lucrative corporate path, she has dedicated nearly seven years to supporting families at a local community center, balancing this with raising her five-year-old daughter, Aisha, and her husband, Marcus, a high school teacher. Her life is anchored by a commitment to helping others, whether through organizing workshops, connecting clients with resources, or simply being present for her family. Tiana’s journey has been shaped by a growing awareness of the need for self-care, particularly after a back injury forced her to confront the limits of her endurance. This balance between giving and preserving her own well-being informs how she approaches her work and relationships—with empathy, resilience, and a quiet determination to make a difference in her community."
