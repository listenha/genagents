            "REI_7": "Tiana describes herself as someone who is empathetic, values community, and is deeply connected to her family and coworkers. While she is reflective and organized in her routines (e.g., tracking her budget, setting aside savings), she does not emphasize logical thinking as a defining trait. Her focus is more on emotional intelligence, relationships, and purpose-driven work. This suggests she may not identify strongly with being highly logical.",

Instead, she often references her emotional and relational experiences, such as her mentorship, family support, and the importance of community.

She also mentions that she 'was always told I had a good head on my shoulders,' which suggests she is thoughtful and reflective. While she is described as being deeply connected to her community and family, and as someone who 'shows up for the people and values that truly matter,' she does not come across as someone who is naturally outgoing or expressive.

            "BFI-10_4": "Tiana has discussed her struggles with anxiety and stress, particularly during busy periods at work and after her back injury. She has also mentioned learning to manage stress through mindfulness, journaling, and setting boundaries. While she has made progress, she still acknowledges moments of overwhelm and the need to work on handling stress better. This suggests she would not score a 5, but she has made enough progress to likely score higher than a 1.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Tiana Johnson mentions that she grew up in a family that valued education and service, and her career in social work reflects a focus on practical, community-oriented work.

However, she also emphasized that she has learned to manage her anxiety through therapy, mindfulness, and support from loved ones. She described her emotional state as being more balanced and grounded now, which suggests she does not see herself as someone who gets nervous easily.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Tiana describes herself as someone who is reflective, purpose-driven, and deeply connected to her community and family. While she values creativity in her work (e.g., organizing community programs, supporting clients, and engaging with art in her neighborhood), there is no explicit mention of her engaging in imaginative or creative pursuits outside of her professional or family life. Her self-description is more grounded in practicality, responsibility, and community service, which aligns more with a lower score on the imagination scale."
