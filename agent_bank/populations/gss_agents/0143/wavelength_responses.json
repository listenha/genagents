Given that horror movies are meant to be frightening, I would place it closer to the 'scared to death' end, but not at the extreme. There’s a balance between fear and boredom, and I think most horror movies fall somewhere in the middle, leaning more toward fear than boredom."

Dinosaurs themselves were not the pinnacle of evolution but rather one of many phases in a process that is not linear or guaranteed to improve. This aligns more with the idea that history is random."

I’ve seen drinking as a way to bond with others and enjoy life, but I also recognize the potential for it to cross into negative territory.
