At its core, math is built on foundational concepts that are straightforward, like addition or multiplication. However, as one delves deeper, it becomes increasingly abstract and layered, requiring critical thinking and creativity. My experience with math has been that it can be simplified for basic understanding, but it also has the potential to be deeply complex, especially in areas like statistics or higher-level algebra. Given my background and how I’ve encountered math in both everyday life and more advanced settings, I believe it sits somewhere in the middle of the spectrum."

While it hints at being in a new city, the imagery of candlelight often evokes warmth, comfort, and familiarity. This makes me think it leans more toward homesickness, as the candlelight might symbolize a longing for comfort or a sense of belonging.
