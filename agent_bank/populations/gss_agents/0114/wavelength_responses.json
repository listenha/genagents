On the other hand, it often requires deeper thinking, especially when dealing with abstract concepts or real-world applications. I’ve seen math as both a tool for solving concrete problems and a field that can be deeply theoretical. Given my own experiences with math in school and in my work, I think it sits somewhere in the middle, leaning more toward the complex side because of its depth and the way it can be applied in creative ways."

I’ve received notes from my mother, friends, and even coworkers that made me feel seen and valued. While a note could be cold if written in a detached way, the act of writing by hand usually implies intention and emotion.

Their existence and extinction are often cited as evidence that history, especially in the natural world, is not a linear path of improvement but rather a series of random events shaped by environmental and evolutionary forces.

In my experience, drinking in moderation, especially in social settings like a dinner with friends or a casual gathering, is often seen as normal or even cool. However, drinking in a way that is excessive, in inappropriate places, or as a way to cope with stress or loneliness would lean more toward 'cringe.' I personally view drinking as a social activity that can be fun and bonding, but I also value moderation and awareness of its potential downsides.

It suggests a sense of being in a new environment, but not necessarily with a strong desire to leave or explore further. Instead, it feels like a moment of calm and introspection, which could imply a mix of curiosity and a subtle yearning for familiarity. Given my own experiences of feeling at home in my current neighborhood while still appreciating the value of connection and stability, I would place this clue somewhere in the middle, leaning slightly toward homesickness as the candlelight might evoke a sense of comfort or longing for a familiar setting."
