While she has strong relationships and is involved in community projects, her responses suggest she doesn't necessarily describe herself as overly extroverted. Her preference for maintaining a budget and saving money, along with her focus on personal well-being, indicates a more reserved nature. However, she is not extremely introverted either, as evidenced by her active participation in community events and her husband's IT job which involves collaboration.",

She values her community and supports community initiatives, which suggests a willingness to trust others and work together for common goals.

            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Ava Martinez describes herself as engaged in community service and has a passion for making a positive impact in her community. While she doesn't mention specific artistic interests, her active lifestyle and involvement in various projects suggest she isn't someone with few artistic interests.

Given her balanced life and the focus on practical achievements, it seems she leans more towards having some interest but not a significant one.",

She mentions facing challenges and stresses, but also has coping mechanisms and a supportive network. While she acknowledges that social media can provide emotional support, her responses indicate a generally stable and resilient personality. She doesn't mention frequent nervousness or anxiety in her daily life, but also isn't overly dismissive of the possibility. Therefore, it seems more likely that she would lean towards the lower end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Based on the interview, Ava describes herself as someone who has made significant career choices and personal decisions, such as joining a leadership program and engaging in community service.
