Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAva Martinez: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia, which is where I've lived most of my life. Growing up, my family was quite modest; both my parents didn't have much formal education, but they worked hard to provide for us. My mom was always busy with different jobs, while my dad was mostly at home taking care of the house. Despite our economic challenges, we were a close-knit family, and my parents instilled in me the values of hard work and community involvement.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAva Martinez: One such moment came when I was in college, around my late teens. I had the opportunity to intern at a local non-profit organization focused on community development, and I also got accepted into a leadership program through my university. At first, I was torn because both opportunities aligned with my interests in public service and community engagement. However, the leadership program promised more structured training and networking, while the non-profit internship offered real-world experience and immediate impact. After much deliberation, I decided to take the leadership program. Looking back, it was one of the best decisions I ever made. It not only enhanced my professional skills but also introduced me to influential people in the field. I met mentors who continue to support me today, and I gained a deeper understanding of how organizations operate. This experience played a crucial role in shaping my career path and solidifying my commitment to public service.\n\n",

I knew that the leadership program would give me a competitive edge and open doors for future opportunities. Plus, I was eager to learn more about the business side of non-profit work. It just seemed like the right fit at the time, and looking back, it has been incredibly rewarding.\n\n",

Additionally, the non-profit where I interned had resources and connections that could have been beneficial, especially since they were working closely with local communities.

Rent is our largest monthly expense, followed by groceries and utilities. We also set aside money for Luna's veterinary care, as she's gotten quite big and needs regular check-ups. I try to allocate some funds for personal development, like books and workshops, and we also save a bit each month for emergencies or future projects.
