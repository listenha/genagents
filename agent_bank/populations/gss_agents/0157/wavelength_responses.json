While some might argue that their extinction led to the rise of mammals and eventually humans, the fact that they dominated the planet for millions of years without leading to 'improvement' suggests randomness rather than a linear path of progress.

However, I also recognize that drinking can be cringe if it's done inappropriately, such as binge drinking or in situations where it leads to embarrassment.

While it could hint at the beauty of a new environment, the mention of 'new city' and the imagery of candlelight might also evoke a sense of solitude or longing. Given my personal experiences, I tend to value stability and familiarity, and while I appreciate new experiences, I also have a strong connection to home.
