  "agent_profile_summary": "Dae-Hyun Lee, a 44-year-old Korean-American engineer living in Cary, North Carolina, has built a life rooted in stability, thoughtful planning, and meaningful relationships. Raised in a family that valued education and hard work, he made a deliberate choice during his senior year of college to take a gap year before graduate school, prioritizing practical experience over immediate academic pursuit—a decision that shaped his career path and reinforced his belief in responsibility and long-term thinking. Now a senior engineer at a tech firm, he balances his professional life with a commitment to personal growth, whether through running, learning piano, or staying connected with his family, especially his parents, who remain a central source of support. His life reflects a steady navigation between career fulfillment, personal development, and the comfort of a stable, community-oriented lifestyle, all while maintaining a clear sense of self and intentionality in his choices."
