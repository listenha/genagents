Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nBrian Miller: Well, I was born in Kansas, in a small town called Overland Park, and I've lived here since I was a kid. My parents were both pretty hardworking\u2014my dad had a Bachelor's degree and worked in engineering, while my mom had an Associate's degree and was a teacher. We had a pretty stable life, and I always felt lucky to have both parents around. I grew up in a tight-knit community, and even though we weren't super wealthy, we had everything we needed. I went to a good high school, got into a state university, and earned my Bachelor's in business. After college, I landed a job in marketing, and I've been working full-time ever since. I married my wife, Sarah, a few years ago\u2014she's a nurse, and we have two kids. Life has been good, though not without its challenges. I've always leaned slightly liberal, and I consider myself an independent, closer to the Democrats. I'm a Protestant, and I've always been proud of my German heritage. I've never served in the military, and I speak only English, but I'm grateful for the opportunities this country has given me and my family.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nBrian Miller: Yeah, there was definitely a crossroads. I was in my second year of college, majoring in business, and I had this internship opportunity with a local company that was pretty small but had a lot of potential. At the same time, I got an offer to work full-time at a bigger firm in another state, which would have paid more and given me more experience upfront. I was torn because the bigger firm seemed like the safer, more stable path, but the smaller company was in my hometown, and I really wanted to stay close to my family. I talked it over with my parents, and they encouraged me to take the smaller job because they believed in the community and the people there. In the end, I chose the smaller company, and it turned out to be the best decision I ever made. I learned so much, got to build something from the ground up, and eventually helped the company grow. That experience really shaped who I am today\u2014more patient, more resilient, and more committed to community. I think that choice defined my career path and even my personal values.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nBrian Miller: I think it was a conscious choice, but not in the way you might expect. I wasn't just weighing the pros and cons of two jobs\u2014I was trying to figure out what kind of person I wanted to be. I realized that if I took the bigger job, I might be making more money, but I could also be sacrificing time with my family and the community I grew up in. I didn't want to become someone who was always chasing the next opportunity, no matter the cost. I wanted to build something meaningful, and I believed that staying in Overland Park would give me that chance. So, I made a decision based on my values, not just my ambitions. I think that's what made it feel right.\n\n",

They didn't push me toward the bigger job, but they also didn't make me feel like I was making a mistake by staying. My dad, in particular, shared some stories from his own career\u2014how he had taken a similar path early on, choosing stability over immediate growth, and how that decision ultimately led him to a more fulfilling life. My mom reminded me that family is the most important thing, and that I should never feel guilty for wanting to be present for them. I also talked to a few mentors from the local business community, and they all encouraged me to take the smaller job because they believed in the potential of the company and the people there. In the end, it wasn't just my decision\u2014it was a combination of their support, my values, and the people around me who helped me see the right path.\n\n",

Sarah works full-time as a nurse at a local hospital, and while it's a demanding job, she's passionate about it. We try to make sure our kids know the value of hard work and kindness, and we're pretty involved in their school and community activities. We also have a small family tradition of going camping every summer\u2014it's something we all look forward to, and it's a chance for us to disconnect from the busyness of life and just be together. Sarah and I have our ups and downs, like any couple, but we're both committed to making it work, and I feel really lucky to have her.\n\n",

Who are they, and what is your relationship with them like?\n\nBrian Miller: My immediate family includes my parents, John and Linda Miller, and my younger sister, Emily. My dad, John, is still working as an engineer, though he's retired from his full-time job now. He's always been a big influence on me, not just with his career but with his strong work ethic and his belief in giving back to the community. My mom, Linda, is still involved in education\u2014she volunteers at the local library and helps with after-school programs for kids. She's always been my biggest supporter, and I think that's why I ended up choosing a career that allows me to be involved in my community as well. Emily is seven years younger than me, and we've always had a close relationship. She's a teacher now, just like our mom, and she's actually the one who encouraged me to think more about how my work impacts others. We talk often, and I really admire the way she's built her own life while staying true to her values. Our family is pretty tight-knit, and even though we all have our own paths, we always make time for each other.

Are there people outside of your family who are important to you?\n\nBrian Miller: Absolutely, there are a few friends and colleagues who have been really important to me over the years. One person who comes to mind is Mark Thompson\u2014he's been my best friend since high school, and we've been through a lot together. He's a few years older than me, and he ended up going into the tech industry, but he's always had this passion for community service. We started a small volunteer group a few years back, focused on helping local families in need, and it's become something we're both really proud of. Mark's always been the one to push me to think bigger, to look beyond my own life and consider how I can make a difference in the lives of others. Then there's my colleague, Rachel, who I work with at the marketing firm. She's been a huge mentor to me, especially early in my career. She's not just good at her job\u2014she's incredibly compassionate and always encourages her team to find purpose in what they do. I think she's one of the reasons I've stayed committed to my values in the workplace. And of course, there's Sarah's best friend, Claire, who's like family to me too. She's been there for us through every major life event, from our wedding to the birth of our kids. I don't know where I'd be without the people who have stood by me throughout the years\u2014they've all played a role in shaping who I am today.\n\n",

It's one of those places where everyone knows each other, and there's a real sense of community. Our street, Evergreen Terrace, is lined with nicely kept homes, and there are a few parks nearby where the kids can play. I really appreciate how safe and welcoming the area is\u2014there's always someone around to help out if you need it. We have a small community center down the street that hosts events like holiday parties, movie nights, and even some local workshops. It's become a hub for people to connect, and I've gotten involved in a few of the initiatives there. I think that's one of the reasons I feel so rooted here\u2014it's not just a place to live, it's a place where I can contribute and be part of something bigger.

There's a real sense of watchfulness among the neighbors\u2014people look out for each other, especially when it comes to the kids. I've never had any issues with crime or safety, and I think that's because of the community spirit. We have a neighborhood watch program, and even though it's not formal, there's an unspoken understanding that we all have each other's backs. I remember one time when a car broke into a garage down the street, and within minutes, half the neighborhood was out there helping the owner and calling the police. That kind of thing doesn't happen everywhere, and it's one of the reasons I'm so grateful to live here. It's not just about the safety\u2014it's about the trust and connection we have with one another. That's something I hope my kids grow up with too.\n\n",

There's always someone to help out, whether it's fixing a fence, helping with a project, or just lending a listening ear. I think that sense of connection is something that's really rare these days.

I enjoy reading the newspaper, sipping coffee, and sometimes going for a short walk around the neighborhood. It's my way of starting the day with intention.

I've been pretty active my whole life, so I don't struggle with weight or fitness the way some people do.

I also make sure to see my doctor at least once a year for a check-up, and I've been pretty consistent with that. Sarah and I both believe in preventive care, so we're not the type to wait until something's wrong before we do something about it.

Whether it's walking the kids to school, running errands, or even just mowing the lawn, I'm always on my feet. Plus, I really enjoy cooking, so I try to keep meals balanced and nutritious. I've never been a big fan of fast food, and I think that's helped me avoid some of the pitfalls that come with a busier schedule. On the harder side, though, it's the consistency. There are days when work gets overwhelming, or the kids are extra busy with activities, and I find myself skipping my workouts or grabbing a quick bite instead of preparing something healthy. I also struggle with the temptation to stay up late watching TV or scrolling through my phone, which can throw off my sleep schedule. But honestly, I think the key is balance.

It wasn't anything serious\u2014my doctor said it was benign, but it was causing some discomfort, especially after long days at work or after playing with the kids. The recovery was straightforward, just a few weeks of rest and some physical therapy. It was a bit of a wake-up call for me, though. I realized how much I take my body for granted, and it made me more committed to staying active and listening to my body when it's telling me to slow down. I also started seeing a chiropractor once a month to help with the occasional back pain I get from sitting at my desk all day.

How about you?\n\nBrian Miller: Honestly, the surgery and the recovery didn't really disrupt my work or my ability to care for the kids. I was lucky that the procedure was minor and that I could still manage my responsibilities, even if I had to take it a bit easier for a few weeks. I did have to adjust my schedule a little\u2014like taking shorter walks or avoiding the more physically demanding tasks around the house\u2014but overall, it wasn't a major setback. What it did do, though, was make me more aware of how important it is to take care of my body. I realized that even small things, like sitting for long periods or pushing through pain, can add up over time. Since then, I've been more intentional about taking breaks, stretching during the day, and making sure I'm not overexerting myself. I think that's one of the reasons I've been able to keep up with work and family life\u2014it's not about being perfect, but about being mindful of how my choices affect my health in the long run.\n\n",

Life with two young kids is never without its challenges\u2014there are days when I feel like I'm running on empty, trying to keep up with their needs, work deadlines, and the demands of being a part of this community. But there's also a lot of joy in it. I've been really grateful for the support of my family and friends, especially during the holidays when we all come together. I think one of the things that's helped me stay grounded is the sense of purpose I feel in both my work and my community involvement. I've been working on a few projects at the company that support local schools, and it's been rewarding to see the impact we're making. On a personal level, I've been trying to be more present for my kids, which means slowing down and really listening to them, even when life feels chaotic. I've also been more intentional about my health, making sure I'm getting enough sleep, eating better, and staying active. It's not always easy, but I feel like I'm on the right path.

How about for you?\n\nBrian Miller: Honestly, I haven't struggled with depression or anxiety in the way some people do, but I think it's important to acknowledge that there have been moments when I've felt overwhelmed. There were definitely times, especially in the early days of parenthood, when I felt like I was juggling too many things at once\u2014work, family, community responsibilities\u2014and I wondered if I was doing enough for everyone. I remember one particularly tough week when Sarah was working late, the kids were sick, and I had a big project due at work. I felt like I was constantly running but never catching up. But what helped me was talking to someone I trusted\u2014whether it was Sarah, my dad, or even Mark from the volunteer group. They reminded me that it's okay to feel stressed, but it's also okay to ask for help. I think the key for me has been learning to recognize when I'm feeling down and not pushing through it alone. I've started making a point to take a few minutes each day to just breathe and check in with myself, and that's made a big difference.

But honestly, we've learned to lean on each other more than ever.

We've had our share of late nights and early mornings, but there's a real sense of unity in how we've navigated it all. Our family traditions, like our summer camping trips and Sunday dinners, have become even more meaningful during this time.

I was raised Protestant, and while I don't attend church every week, I find comfort in the values that have been passed down through my family\u2014things like kindness, hard work, and the importance of community. My parents were pretty involved in their church growing up, and I remember going to Sunday school and youth group, which taught me a lot about faith and how to treat others. I think what keeps me connected to my faith is the way it shapes the way I live\u2014not just through rituals, but through the choices I make every day. I don't claim to have all the answers, and I know faith can be a deeply personal thing, but for me, it's been a source of strength, especially during tough times. It's not about being perfect or following rules\u2014it's about finding meaning in life and being part of something bigger than myself.

I've always been more of a person who prefers face-to-face interactions or even a phone call over scrolling through a feed. I do have a Facebook account, mostly to stay in touch with family and old friends from college, but I don't spend a lot of time on it. I think it's easy to get caught up in comparing your life to others' highlight reels, and I've always felt like my life is more meaningful when I'm living it, not watching it through a screen. I do follow a few local community pages and some family groups, which helps me stay connected to what's going on in Overland Park. But for the most part, I think I'm pretty content with keeping things simple. I know some people use Instagram or Twitter to share their lives with the world, but I've never felt the need to do that. I like my privacy, and I think it's important to have moments where I'm just present without distractions.

The majority of that goes toward the kids' needs\u2014school fees, extracurricular activities, and supplies.

The mortgage is manageable, especially since we've been paying it off steadily over the years.

Then, when the kids started school in the fall, we had a spike in expenses for uniforms, supplies, and extracurricular activities.

I've always focused on building a stable, full-time career in marketing, and I've been with Horizon Solutions for the past seven years. I think that's been the right path for me\u2014not just because of the stability it provides, but because it allows me to be present for my family. I've considered taking on side projects or consulting work on the weekends, especially when I had more free time before the kids started school, but I've always found that adding more responsibilities can take away from the time I want to spend with Sarah and the kids. I've learned to be content with one job that gives me purpose, flexibility, and the ability to contribute to the community in ways that matter to me. Plus, I've always believed in the value of focusing on one thing and doing it well, rather than spreading myself too thin.\n\n",

My family has been my rock\u2014Sarah's strength, the kids' growing independence, and the way we've leaned on each other through the ups and downs. I also realized how much I value the quiet, real-life connections I have with friends and neighbors, rather than relying on social media or online communities for support. It's not always easy to stay grounded, but I'm learning to find peace in the little things, like a conversation with Sarah, a walk with the kids, or even just being present in the moment.

That comes from my salary at Horizon Solutions and Sarah's nursing job. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our expenses and still save a little for the future. I think what's important is that we're both working full-time jobs we enjoy, and we're able to provide for our family without too much stress. It's not always easy balancing work and life, especially with two kids, but I feel lucky that we've been able to build a stable income over the years. I also know that our earnings are in line with what people in Overland Park typically make, and I'm grateful for the opportunities this country has given me and my family.\n\n",

The benefits of the job are pretty standard for a mid-sized company\u2014health insurance for me, Sarah, and the kids, which covers a lot of the medical costs we might run into. We also get paid time off, which is something I really appreciate, especially with the kids in school. I get about two weeks of vacation a year, and I try to use that time to take the family on a trip or just relax at home. We also have sick days, which is helpful when one of the kids is under the weather or when I need to take a day off for myself. One of the things I like most about the job is that they offer some flexibility\u2014like the option to work from home a couple of days a week, which has been a lifesaver during the busier times with the kids. It's not the most glamorous job, but it's stable, and I feel like I'm making a real impact in the community through the work we do.

I respect her a lot, and I feel like she genuinely cares about the team's success. As for my coworkers, we've built a pretty tight-knit group over the years. We're all in different roles\u2014some in design, some in analytics, and others in client relations\u2014but we collaborate a lot, and there's a real sense of camaraderie. We have lunch together most Fridays, and we've even started a few traditions, like a monthly trivia night or a coffee break where we share personal stories.

The company allows me to work from home a couple of days a week, which has been a huge help, especially when the kids are sick or when I need to get some work done after a long day with them.

He was detail-oriented and had a real passion for problem-solving. I remember him coming home with blueprints and sketches, and he'd often explain what he was working on in a way that made it feel exciting, even to a kid. My mom, on the other hand, was a middle school teacher, and her most important activities revolved around creating a safe, engaging learning environment for her students.

It was a pretty traditional business, but they had a strong reputation for quality work. My mom worked at a public school district in our town, specifically at Overland Park Middle School.
