His responses suggest a more balanced, intuitive, and values-driven approach to life rather than one that is heavily analytical.",
            "REI_3": "Brian Miller describes himself as someone who values community, family, and purpose over purely analytical or logical pursuits. He often reflects on his decisions in terms of values, relationships, and emotional impact, rather than purely data-driven reasoning. He also emphasizes the importance of intuition and connection in his life, which suggests he leans more toward an intuitive, less analytical approach to thinking.",
            "REI_4": "Brian Miller demonstrates thoughtful decision-making throughout the interview, such as when he reflects on his career choice, family life, and community involvement. He often takes time to consider values, long-term impacts, and the influence of others before making decisions.

            "REI_5": "Brian Miller appears to be a composed, thoughtful individual who makes deliberate decisions based on values and reflection. He describes himself as someone who values balance, community, and intentionality. He also mentions being able to manage stress through routines, mindfulness, and support from his family and friends. This suggests he is capable of handling pressure and maintaining clarity, which aligns more with disagreeing with the statement.",
            "REI_6": "Brian Miller's interview does not emphasize logical reasoning as a core strength. He speaks more about community, family, and values than about analytical or problem-solving skills. His decisions, like choosing to stay in his hometown, are framed as value-based rather than purely logical. This suggests he may not see himself as exceptionally strong in logical reasoning compared to others.",
            "REI_7": "Brian Miller describes himself as someone who values community, family, and purpose. While he does show some analytical thinking (e.g., in his job as a marketing manager, where he analyzes data and develops strategies), his narrative is more centered on emotional and relational aspects of life, such as family, community, and values. He doesn't emphasize logic or structured reasoning as a defining trait, which suggests he would not score very high on this statement.",
