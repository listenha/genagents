My own experiences growing up in Overland Park, surrounded by a tight-knit community, have shown me that what one person finds beautiful can vary widely. For example, the way my family values community and connection often shapes how we perceive beauty in people, places, and experiences. While there may be some universal aspects, the emotional and personal connection to beauty makes it more of a subjective experience for me."

Based on my experiences and understanding of how aircraft operate, the noise from an engine is a defining characteristic. While there might be moments when the engine is quieter (like during cruise or when it's not running), the clue 'aircraft engine' most commonly refers to the engine in operation, which is associated with high noise levels.

Their existence doesn't directly relate to the idea of civilization improving, but their extinction could be seen as a random event that shaped the course of life. I lean more toward the 'random' side because the rise and fall of dinosaurs was not a direct step toward modern civilization, but rather a series of random biological and environmental events. However, their role in the evolutionary process does suggest some form of progression, so I place it closer to the middle."
