While there are some objective elements (like the symmetry of a well-built house), my sense of beauty is more tied to emotional resonance and personal meaning.

While it lacks the natural sweetness of regular Coke, it is far from bland. Its zesty qualities come from its carbonation, citrus notes, and the strong artificial sweeteners. It's not overly complex or rich, but it definitely has a distinct, lively flavor that sets it apart from neutral beverages.

In my life, I've received notes from my family and friends that felt meaningful and heartfelt. For example, my brother Sean has often left me notes encouraging me to keep going, and those notes have always felt warm and personal. Even though a hand-written note can sometimes be simple, it often carries emotional weight that makes it feel warm and fuzzy. I don’t see it as cold or jagged unless it's completely devoid of intent or emotion, which isn’t usually the case with a handwritten message."
