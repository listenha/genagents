She mentions feeling more connected through late-night talks on the porch with her family and through her work and volunteer efforts with Jamie. While she is not shy or withdrawn, she is not described as outgoing or attention-seeking. She seems to value quiet, thoughtful interactions and is more introspective, which aligns more with a middle or lower score on the reserved scale.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Kelly Sullivan has shared a life story that reflects a mix of trust and caution. She has relied on her family, friends like Jamie, and community support systems, which suggests she is capable of trusting others.

This suggests she is more likely to rate herself low on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Kelly has described her life as one of steady progress and small steps, often reflecting on how she is learning and growing. While she has made efforts to improve, such as passing her GED and helping with Jamie's nonprofit, she also acknowledges that she is still figuring things out.

She mentions feeling overwhelmed at times, especially when juggling multiple responsibilities.

She prefers quiet, reflective moments and has a deep, thoughtful way of speaking. While she is not shy or withdrawn, she seems to be more introspective and deliberate in her interactions, which aligns more with a reserved personality.
