While she is not shy or withdrawn, she is not described as outgoing or attention-seeking. She seems to value quiet, thoughtful interactions and is more introspective, which aligns more with a middle or lower score on the reserved scale.",

She has relied on her family, friends like Jamie, and community support systems, which suggests she is capable of trusting others.

This suggests she is more likely to rate herself low on this scale.",

While she has made efforts to improve, such as passing her GED and helping with Jamie's nonprofit, she also acknowledges that she is still figuring things out.

            "REI_1": "Kelly has described moments in her life where she felt stuck, uncertain, and struggled with decisions, such as after high school when she felt like she was bouncing between jobs without a clear path. She also mentioned feeling overwhelmed by the challenges of balancing work, education, and helping others. While she has made progress and taken steps toward self-improvement, she still expresses uncertainty about her future and admits to feeling stuck at times. This suggests she may not feel confident in her ability to solve complex problems, aligning her more with the higher end of the scale.",
            "REI_2": "Kelly has demonstrated a thoughtful and reflective approach to her life, including making deliberate decisions about her future, managing her time and responsibilities, and engaging in structured learning like her GED program. While she acknowledges challenges and moments of uncertainty, she consistently shows an ability to analyze her situation, set goals, and take actionable steps. This suggests she has a reasonable level of confidence in her logical problem-solving abilities.",
            "REI_3": "Kelly Sullivan's interview reflects a more intuitive and reflective approach to life. She often speaks about her decisions in emotional or experiential terms, such as 'feeling stuck,' 'letting go of holding my breath,' or 'taking small steps.' She does not emphasize logical analysis or structured reasoning in her narrative, instead focusing on personal growth, relationships, and emotional resilience. This suggests she is more in tune with her feelings and experiences than with analytical thinking.",
            "REI_4": "Kelly Sullivan demonstrates thoughtful reflection throughout the interview, often weighing her options, considering the impact of her decisions, and acknowledging her growth over time. She reflects on her choices, such as moving to Charlotte, pursuing her GED, and helping Jamie with her nonprofit, which shows she does engage in careful reasoning. While she may not always feel confident in her decisions, she consistently shows an ability to think through her life choices and their consequences.",
            "REI_5": "Kelly has described feeling anxious and overwhelmed at times, especially when juggling multiple responsibilities like work, school, and helping with Jamie's nonprofit. She also mentioned struggling with anxiety and feeling stuck in cycles of stress. These reflections suggest she may not reason well under pressure, aligning with a lower score on this scale.",
            "REI_6": "Kelly describes herself as someone who has struggled with uncertainty and has often felt like she was 'figuring things out' in a more intuitive or emotional way, such as when she made the decision to move to Charlotte after high school. She also mentions feeling stuck in cycles and relying on small, consistent efforts rather than a structured, logical plan. This suggests she may not see herself as particularly strong in logical reasoning.",
            "REI_7": "Kelly's interview suggests she is more intuitive and reflective rather than highly analytical. She often speaks about her feelings, personal growth, and the importance of relationships. While she has made deliberate choices in her life, such as moving to Charlotte and pursuing her GED, these decisions seem to be driven more by emotional and personal motivations than by a structured, logical analysis of options. She doesn't display a strong preference for systematic or analytical thinking in her narrative.",
            "REI_8": "Kelly Sullivan reflects on her life with a great deal of introspection, considering her past decisions, her current challenges, and her future hopes. She often takes time to reflect on her experiences and decisions, such as when she decided to move to Charlotte after high school or when she talks about her GED and future goals. This suggests she values thoughtful consideration and is not opposed to thinking things through carefully.",
            "REI_9": "Kelly often reflects on her life with emotional awareness and emphasizes the importance of support from others, such as her family and friends, in navigating challenges. While she is making deliberate choices (e.g., moving to Charlotte, pursuing her GED), she also acknowledges her struggles with anxiety and uncertainty. This suggests she may not always rely on logic as her primary method for problem-solving, but rather on a mix of emotional insight and social support.",
            "REI_10": "Kelly reflects on her decisions and the reasoning behind them throughout the interview. She discusses her conscious choice to move to Charlotte after high school, her decision to pursue her GED, and her reasons for helping Jamie with her nonprofit. She also reflects on her motivations and the influences of her family and friends, showing a tendency to think through her decisions and explain them."

She often reflects on her life in quiet, introspective ways, such as walking by the river or journaling. She also mentions feeling more comfortable with small, familiar groups, like her family and close friends, rather than larger or more public settings. This suggests a tendency toward being reserved rather than outgoing.",

            "BFI-10_4": "Kelly has described experiencing anxiety and stress throughout the interview, particularly around her future, financial instability, and health. She has also mentioned struggling with back pain and feeling stuck in a cycle of uncertainty, which indicates she does not always handle stress well. While she has made progress in seeking help and developing coping strategies, such as talking to a counselor and setting small goals, she still feels the weight of her challenges. This suggests she would not rate herself as highly on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Kelly mentions enjoying reading, which is a form of artistic or intellectual engagement, but there is no indication she participates in or identifies with other artistic interests like music, visual arts, or creative writing. Her focus is more on practical life goals, such as education, work, and helping others, rather than creative expression. This suggests she is more aligned with the lower end of the range.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Kelly describes herself as someone who values close, meaningful relationships with family and a few key friends, like Jamie. While she is described as supportive and involved in her community, she also mentions preferring quiet, introspective moments, such as walking by the river or reading at the bookstore. She doesn't use social media much and doesn't seem to seek out large social groups or events. Her interactions are more about deep, personal connections rather than being the center of social activity.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Kelly Sullivan's interview portrays her as someone who is reflective, self-aware, and focused on personal growth and helping others. She emphasizes the importance of support systems, values empathy, and has a strong sense of community. She also reflects on her own struggles and acknowledges the need for support, which suggests she is more inclined to be understanding and less prone to finding fault with others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Kelly has described her life as one of balancing multiple responsibilities, including part-time work, helping with a nonprofit, and studying for her GED. While she is committed to her goals, she also acknowledges that she is still figuring things out and sometimes feels stuck in a cycle. She doesn’t always feel in control of her future and has admitted to struggling with anxiety and stress. This suggests she may not always feel confident in her ability to do a thorough job, especially when she feels overwhelmed or uncertain.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Kelly has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, particularly around her future, work, and financial stability. She has mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times, especially when juggling multiple responsibilities like work, education, and helping Jamie with her nonprofit. She also mentioned seeking counseling to manage her anxiety, which suggests she recognizes it as a part of her life. While she is making progress, her self-described experiences align more with the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Kelly Sullivan reflects on her life with a focus on real-world challenges, practical decisions, and the support of her family and community. While she does engage in introspection and has aspirations for her future, she does not describe herself as someone who frequently engages in imaginative or creative thinking.

While she has made efforts to improve her situation—such as pursuing her GED and helping with Jamie’s nonprofit—she has not emphasized a strong aptitude for logical analysis or problem-solving in a structured, analytical way. Her narrative suggests she values emotional support, community, and personal growth over complex logical reasoning.",
            "REI_3": "Kelly Sullivan's interview reveals that she often reflects on her life in emotional and intuitive terms, such as focusing on personal connections, family support, and small steps toward progress. She does not describe herself as someone who approaches challenges with detailed logical analysis but rather with a focus on emotional resilience and community. This suggests she may not identify as a strong analytical thinker.",

She also mentioned struggling with back pain and anxiety, which could impact her ability to think clearly under pressure. However, she also shows resilience, determination, and the ability to take action, such as moving to Charlotte, enrolling in the GED program, and helping others. These traits suggest she may not strongly agree with the statement, but she also shows signs of being affected by stress.",
            "REI_6": "Kelly often reflects on her life with emotional insight and personal growth, but she does not emphasize logical reasoning as a key strength. She describes her journey as one of trial and error, emotional resilience, and support from others, rather than a systematic or analytical approach.

While she is committed to her goals, she also acknowledges that she is still learning and growing. She does not present herself as someone who is overly meticulous or perfectionistic, but rather someone who is trying her best with what she has.

            "REI_1": "Kelly has described facing challenges in her life, such as financial instability, navigating education, and managing her mental health. While she has shown resilience and a willingness to learn, she also acknowledges feeling stuck or uncertain at times. She has not explicitly stated confidence in solving complex problems, and her narrative reflects moments of doubt and the need for support, which aligns more with a higher score on this scale.",
            "REI_2": "Kelly has described her life as one of navigating challenges through persistence, small steps, and support from others. She has faced financial and educational hurdles, but she has also made conscious decisions to improve her life, such as enrolling in GED classes and helping with a nonprofit. These actions suggest she is capable of thoughtful, goal-oriented planning, even if she doesn’t always frame it in terms of 'logical analysis.' She may not see herself as particularly skilled in this area, but she does engage in problem-solving in practical ways.",
            "REI_3": "Kelly Sullivan's interview suggests she is more reflective, intuitive, and emotionally grounded in her decision-making. She often speaks about her life in terms of personal experiences, emotional connections, and the support of her family and community. She reflects on her choices in a narrative, emotional way rather than through structured analysis. Her focus on personal growth, relationships, and small steps indicates a more intuitive and experiential approach to thinking.",
            "REI_4": "Kelly demonstrates thoughtful reflection throughout the interview, such as when she considers her decisions to move to Charlotte, her GED program, and her work with Jamie's nonprofit. She also reflects on her mental health, her family, and her future with a level of introspection that suggests she does engage in careful reasoning, even if she acknowledges her struggles.",
            "REI_5": "Kelly has described experiencing anxiety and feeling overwhelmed at times, particularly when juggling multiple responsibilities like work, school, and helping with Jamie's nonprofit. She also mentioned struggling with stress and having to manage her mental health through counseling. These signs suggest she may not always reason well under pressure, aligning more with the lower end of the range.",
            "REI_6": "Kelly often reflects on her life with emotional insight and personal growth, but she doesn't emphasize logical reasoning as a key strength. She describes her decisions as being driven by personal values, family support, and small, incremental steps rather than a systematic or analytical approach. She also mentions feeling uncertain about her future and relying on others for guidance, which suggests she may not see herself as particularly strong in logical reasoning.",
            "REI_7": "Kelly describes herself as someone who is reflective, values personal growth, and is motivated by emotional and relational factors (e.g., family, community, helping others). She often speaks about her feelings, her struggles with anxiety, and her journey of self-discovery, which suggests a more intuitive or emotional approach to life rather than a strictly logical one. While she is thoughtful and goal-oriented, her narrative emphasizes personal connections and emotional resilience over structured, analytical reasoning.",
            "REI_8": "Kelly Sullivan shows moments of thoughtful reflection in her life, such as when she decided to move to Charlotte after high school, or when she reflects on her GED progress and future goals. However, she also describes feeling stuck in cycles and struggling with anxiety, which may indicate she sometimes avoids overthinking or feels overwhelmed by it. She values small steps and incremental progress, which suggests she may not always engage in deep, deliberate reflection.",
            "REI_9": "Kelly Sullivan describes her life as one of trial and error, with a focus on personal growth and emotional support from family and friends. She often reflects on her decisions as being driven by personal clarity, emotional motivation, and the support of others rather than a systematic or logical approach. She acknowledges uncertainty and the importance of small steps, which suggests a more intuitive or emotional approach to problem-solving rather than a strictly logical one.",
            "REI_10": "Kelly reflects on her decisions throughout the interview, such as her choice to move to Charlotte after high school, her decision to pursue her GED, and her commitment to helping Jamie with her nonprofit. She often explains her motivations and the reasoning behind her actions, showing a clear understanding of her decisions and their impact."
