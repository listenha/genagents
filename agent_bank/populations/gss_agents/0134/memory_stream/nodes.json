Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nKelly Sullivan: Well, I was born and raised in Charleston, South Carolina, in a small, working-class neighborhood. My parents both grew up in the South Atlantic region too, and they worked hard to make ends meet. I remember my childhood being pretty straightforward\u2014nothing fancy, but full of love and family. We lived in a modest house on Elm Street, and my dad worked construction while my mom worked part-time at a local store. Both of them only made it through high school, so education wasn't really something they could talk about with much confidence. I was the first in my family to graduate from high school, which was a big deal for them. I always felt like I had to prove myself, not just to them, but to the world. After high school, I tried a few things\u2014worked at a diner, then a retail store\u2014but nothing really stuck. I've been laid off a few times, and it's been tough trying to find steady work, especially with the economy the way it is. I'm still looking, though, and I'm trying to figure out what I want to do next. I've always been independent, and I think that's why I never really identified with any political party. I just want things to be fair for everyone, you know?\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nKelly Sullivan: There was one moment that really shaped me, and it happened right after I graduated high school. I was 18, and I had this idea that if I worked hard enough, I could get out of the cycle my parents were in. I applied to a few community colleges, but I was also working full-time at a diner to help support my family. I remember one night, after working a double shift, I was sitting on the porch, looking at the stars, and I realized I didn't want to just survive\u2014I wanted to have a real future. That's when I decided to take a chance and move to a different city for a while, to see what else was out there. I ended up in Charlotte for a few months, working at a retail store and taking night classes. It was tough, but I met people who were going to college and talking about their dreams. That's when I realized I needed to go back to school, even if it meant starting over. I came back to Charleston, enrolled in a GED program, and eventually got my high school diploma. That moment on the porch was the crossroads\u2014choosing to keep going instead of settling. It changed everything for me.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nKelly Sullivan: I think it was a conscious choice, but it felt like something inside me just clicked. I didn't have a plan, but I knew I couldn't stay in that same place forever. It was like I was holding my breath for so long, and finally, I let it out. I remember telling my mom that night, 'I'm not going to let this be my life.' She didn't say much, just hugged me and said, 'I believe in you.' That meant more than anything. I didn't have a lot of resources, but I had that moment of clarity, and I made a decision to push forward. It wasn't easy, but I think that's what makes it real\u2014knowing you're choosing to change, even when the path isn't clear.\n\n",

I remember talking to a counselor at the community center once, and she suggested some job training programs, but I was too scared to take the next step. I felt like I didn't have the time or the resources. If someone had really sat down with me and helped me see the options, maybe I wouldn't have spent so much time bouncing between jobs. But I also know that I had to take the first step myself. It's a tough balance between needing help and wanting to prove you can do it on your own.\n\n",

Do you have a partner, or children?\n\nKelly Sullivan: I don't have a partner or children right now. My family is my mom and dad, and my younger brother, Sean. He's 19 and just finished his first year of college online. He's the one who really pushed me to keep going after I came back from Charlotte. He'd always say, 'You can do better than this, Kelly.' It's funny, because I used to think I was the responsible one, but now I see how much he's grown. My parents are still living in the same house on Elm Street, and even though things are tight, they always make sure I know I'm not alone. I visit them as much as I can, and we still have those late-night talks on the porch, just like when I was younger. I guess I'm still figuring out what I want for myself, but I know I want to make sure my family is proud of me, and that I can be there for them when they need me.\n\n",

It wasn't easy, and I wish I had more support back then, but I also know I had to take that first step on my own. Now, seeing my brother grow and push forward, I feel like I'm finally in a place where I can be there for him the way he was there for me.

He was the first to go to college, and he ended up working in IT. He always kept in touch, even when we were kids, and he'd send us books or talk to us about what he was learning. I used to think he was kind of a nerd, but now I see how much he sacrificed to get out of our situation. We don't talk as much these days, but when we do, it's always about family and what we're trying to build for ourselves.

She was a barista there too, but she had this way of making everyone feel seen, even if they were just passing through. We bonded over late-night shifts and our shared frustration with the system. She ended up moving back to Charleston a few years ago and started a small nonprofit that helps people like me\u2014people who are trying to get back on their feet but don't know where to start. I've been volunteering with her a bit, just helping out with administrative stuff, and it's been really rewarding. Jamie's the kind of person who doesn't just talk about change; she lives it.

There are more apartments and small businesses popping up, which is kind of cool. It's still pretty working-class, though, and I feel like I fit in here. I rent a small apartment above a bakery, and the owner, Mrs. Delgado, is like a second mom to me. She always brings me pastries when I'm struggling and listens when I need to talk. The area isn't perfect\u2014there are some issues with crime and not enough job opportunities\u2014but there's a real sense of community.

The neighborhood has its challenges, but I think the sense of community helps keep things from getting too bad. People know each other, and there's a kind of unspoken agreement to look out for one another. I've never had anything bad happen to me, and I think that's partly because I try to be respectful and keep my head down.

I work part-time at a small bookstore downtown, which is nice because it's quiet and the customers are pretty friendly. I usually work mornings, so I have the afternoons free to catch up on things. Some days I'll spend time helping Jamie with her nonprofit, sorting donations or organizing events.

I try to go to the community center a couple of times a week too\u2014they have some free workshops on job skills and resume building. I've been going to one on communication, and it's been really helpful. I also make sure to visit my parents at least once a week, usually on weekends.

I've also been trying to focus more on the people around me\u2014my family, Jamie, even the people at the community center. They've all been there for me, and I think that's what's keeping me going. I don't know what's next, but I'm trying to believe that it will be better.\n\n",

It also made me think about my health, and how I've been neglecting it for so long. I used to be more active, more present in my own life, but the stress of trying to find my way has taken a toll. I'm learning, though, that taking care of myself isn't just about big changes\u2014it's about the little things, like getting up a little earlier, walking by the river, or even just eating a proper meal before work.

How about for you?\n\nKelly Sullivan: I think I've dealt with anxiety more than anything else, and sometimes it feels like it's always been there, just in the background. There were times when I didn't even realize how much it was affecting me\u2014like when I was bouncing between jobs or feeling like I wasn't good enough. I used to push through it, thinking that if I just worked harder, I could ignore it. But over the past year, I've started to see it for what it is. It's not a sign that I'm failing; it's just part of trying to navigate a life that feels uncertain. I've been going to the counselor at the community center, and it's helped me understand that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, to feel like I'm not enough, or like I'm not moving fast enough. I used to think I had to be strong all the time, but now I see that being honest about my struggles is a kind of strength too. I'm still learning how to manage it, but I'm trying not to let it define me. I want to be more than my anxiety, and I think that's the first step.\n\n",

I guess I'm more of a quiet person, and I find that the more I'm online, the more I feel like I'm comparing myself to others.

Rent is the biggest chunk\u2014my apartment above the bakery is pretty affordable, but it still takes up about half of my income. Groceries are tricky because I try to eat healthy but don't always have the budget for fresh produce. I end up buying a lot of canned goods and staples to stretch my dollars. The GED materials weren't too bad, but I had to pay for a few online courses and a textbook, which added up. I also had to set aside some money for my mom and dad's bills, just to help out a little. It's a tight budget, but I manage by cutting back on things like eating out or buying new clothes. I know it's not much, but I'm trying to be responsible and not take on more debt.

Last month, I'd say we spent around $1,500 total, give or take. That's pretty much the usual, though it can fluctuate depending on how much I'm working or if I have to pay for something unexpected, like a new pair of shoes or a doctor's visit.

In the winter, heating costs are a bigger hit, and I have to use more electricity for lights and the little heater I have. I also noticed that when the holidays come around, like Christmas or Thanksgiving, I end up spending a bit more on groceries because I try to make something special for my family.

That's mostly from my part-time job at the bookstore and the odd jobs I pick up around the neighborhood. I don't make a lot, but I try to stretch every dollar as much as I can. Sometimes I feel like I'm just barely keeping up, but I know I'm doing the best I can with what I have. I don't want to worry my parents too much, so I try to cover as much of their bills as I can, even if it's just a little. It's not much, but it helps them feel like they're not alone in this. I guess I'm still learning what it means to be responsible, but I'm trying to be more mindful of every dollar I earn and every step I take toward a better future.\n\n",

The hours are steady, and the people I work with are pretty easygoing. Mrs. Thompson, the owner, is like a second mother to me\u2014she's always checking in on me, making sure I'm okay, and even letting me take a break when I need to. As for benefits, well, there's not much in the way of health insurance or paid time off. I get a few days off a month, but they're not guaranteed, and I don't have any sick days or vacation days to speak of. It's not much, but I don't mind\u2014it's more about the flexibility and the fact that I can keep working while still trying to take classes and help out with Jamie's nonprofit. I know it's not the most stable job, but it's something I can rely on, and that's enough for now.\n\n",

She knows I'm juggling a lot\u2014work, school, and helping Jamie with her nonprofit\u2014and she's always been supportive. She doesn't push me too hard, and she lets me take breaks when I need to, which is something I really appreciate. As for the other staff, there are a couple of regulars who I've gotten to know pretty well. We don't talk much, but we're friendly, and they always make sure I have a smile on my face when I'm feeling down. It's not a high-pressure environment, and that's exactly what I need right now. I don't need a lot of drama or stress at work\u2014I just want to feel like I'm doing something that matters, even if it's just helping someone find the right book or having a quick chat with a customer. I think that's why I keep coming back, even when the pay isn't great. It's the people, the quiet, and the little moments that make it feel like home.\n\n",

Mrs. Thompson lets me know when she needs me in, and I usually work mornings from 9 to 12, but sometimes I can adjust if I need to be somewhere else in the afternoon. It's not the kind of job where I have to be there at the exact same time every day, which is a relief because I'm also trying to balance my GED classes, helping Jamie with her nonprofit, and taking care of my family. I don't mind working irregular hours as long as I can still make it to the things that matter. It's not perfect, but it gives me the freedom to manage my time in a way that works for me, even if it means sometimes working late or taking a day off when I need to rest.\n\n",
