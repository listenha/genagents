    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nAnne Mullins: Well, I was born in Des Moines, Iowa, and I've lived in the state most of my life, though I moved around a bit as a kid. My father passed away when I was just ten years old, which was really hard on my family. My mother worked multiple jobs to keep us afloat, and she always made sure we had what we needed, even if it wasn't much. I grew up in a small, tight-knit neighborhood where everyone knew each other, and I remember playing outside until the streetlights came on every evening. I was a pretty quiet kid, always more interested in books than in sports or socializing. I guess that's why I ended up going to college \u2014 I wanted to learn as much as I could and maybe find a way to make a better life for myself. I got my bachelor's degree in business administration, which wasn't exactly what I had in mind at first, but it ended up being a good fit. I met my husband, Tom, while I was working part-time at a local bookstore, and we've been married for over ten years now. We have two kids, a boy and a girl, and we live in the same house I grew up in, though it's been remodeled a bit. Life hasn't always been easy, but I've always tried to keep a positive outlook and make the best of what I have.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nAnne Mullins: There was definitely a crossroads in my life, and it came right after my father passed away. I was only ten, and I remember feeling like the world had shifted beneath my feet. My mother was strong, but she was also exhausted, working two jobs just to keep the lights on. I remember sitting at the kitchen table one night, watching her cry quietly after she got home from her second shift, and I realized that if I wanted to change our situation, I had to take responsibility. I decided then that I would work hard in school, not just for myself but for her. I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up, but I knew I didn't want to end up in the same place we were. That decision led me to focus on my studies, and eventually, I got a scholarship to a local community college. I remember feeling so proud when I walked across that stage to receive my bachelor's degree \u2014 it felt like I was finally paying back the sacrifices my mother made. That moment defined who I am today: someone who believes in hard work, resilience, and the power of education to change your life.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nAnne Mullins: I think it was a conscious choice, even if I didn't realize it at the time. I remember sitting there at that kitchen table, watching my mom struggle, and I felt this deep sense of responsibility. I didn't have a lot of options, but I knew I had to make something of myself. I didn't just decide to work hard \u2014 I decided to take control of my future. I remember telling my mom that night, 'I'm going to make sure you don't have to work this hard anymore.' It wasn't just a promise to myself, it was a promise to her. And I think that's what made the difference. I didn't just drift \u2014 I chose a path, and I stuck to it, even when it was hard.\n\n",

My mom didn't ask for help \u2014 she was too proud, and I think I felt the same way. But looking back, I wish we had reached out more. There were programs at the school for kids who had lost a parent, and maybe that could have given me more support. I remember one teacher who noticed I was quiet and offered to help me with my homework after school. That small act of kindness meant a lot. I think if more people had seen us and offered a hand, it might have made things a little easier. But I also know that even without that help, I had the strength to push through \u2014 and I'm proud of that too.\n\n",

My husband, Tom, and I met at that local bookstore I mentioned earlier \u2014 he was a part-time manager there, and I was working the cash register. We connected over our shared love of books and music, and it wasn't long before we started dating. We got married when I was 28, and shortly after, we had our first child, a son named Liam. A few years later, our daughter, Claire, came along. They're both wonderful kids \u2014 Liam is into sports and has a passion for photography, while Claire is more of a bookworm like me. We live in the same house I grew up in, which feels like a full circle in some ways. It's not perfect, but it's our home, and we've built a lot of memories there. Tom and I both work full-time, and while it's busy, we try to make time for each other and for the kids. I think the most important thing is that we're all in this together, and we support each other through the ups and downs of life.\n\n",

I'm proud of the choices I made, even when it wasn't easy, and I'm grateful for the small acts of kindness I received along the way. It's also humbling to think about how much support I could have used but didn't ask for \u2014 I hope I can be that kind of support for others now.

My mom has always been my rock \u2014 even though she didn't ask for help, she gave me everything she could, and I know she's proud of the life I've built. We don't see each other as often as I'd like because she moved to a smaller town in the same state after she retired, but whenever we do get together, it's like no time has passed. Sean is ten years younger than me, and while we had our share of sibling rivalry growing up, we're close now. He's a mechanic and has a family of his own \u2014 two kids and a wife who's a nurse. We keep in touch, and I love hearing about his life. He always says I was the one who made it out, but I tell him he's got his own path to walk.

One of them is Sarah, who I met in college. We were in the same business class, and even though I was pretty quiet back then, she always made sure to include me in conversations. She became one of my closest friends, and even after we graduated, we stayed in touch. She ended up moving to Chicago for a job, but we still talk regularly. She's the one who encouraged me to apply for that management position at the bookstore, which eventually led to meeting Tom. Then there's my neighbor, Linda, who's been like a second mother to me. She's always had my back, whether it was helping me with the kids or just listening when I needed someone to talk to. I think the people who matter most in life are the ones who show up, even when things are tough \u2014 and I'm lucky to have a few of them in my corner.\n\n",

It's a quiet place, not too far from the city center but still with that small-town feel. There's a park right down the street where the kids play, and a few local shops that have been around for decades.

If something were ever wrong, I think someone would be on my doorstep before I even had a chance to call for help. That said, I'm not naive \u2014 there are always risks in any place, but I think the strong community ties here make a big difference.

The good thing is, I've always felt a sense of belonging here. There are days when I get frustrated with the slow pace or the occasional inconvenience \u2014 like the time the city tried to redo the roads and it took six months to finish \u2014 but I've learned to roll with it. The downside is that sometimes the same small-town feel that makes me feel safe can also feel a little insular. There are people who don't always understand the struggles of someone who grew up in a less-than-ideal situation, and I've had to learn how to set boundaries when I need to. But overall, I think the positives outweigh the negatives. I love the sense of history here, the way the seasons change so clearly, and the fact that my kids are growing up in a place that feels like home.

First, tell me all about your health.\n\nAnne Mullins: As for my health, I'd say I'm in pretty good shape overall, though I've had my share of ups and downs. I used to be pretty active as a kid \u2014 I remember running around the neighborhood with my friends, climbing trees, and even trying to keep up with my brother when he was younger.

The kids have started joining me on my walks, and it's become a bonding moment for us \u2014 we talk about their day, laugh about the silly things that happen, and it's a way to disconnect from the chaos of school and work. But what makes it hard is the constant juggling act. There are days when I'm so caught up in work deadlines or helping with homework that I forget to eat properly or take a break. I also struggle with staying consistent when the weather is bad or when I'm just too tired after a long day. It's not about perfection \u2014 it's about showing up, even if it's just for ten minutes of yoga or a quick walk around the block. I've learned that small, consistent choices matter more than trying to do everything at once.

I started experiencing some persistent back pain, which I initially dismissed as just stress or poor posture from sitting at my desk too long. But after a few months of it getting worse, I finally made an appointment with a doctor. Turns out, I had a herniated disc in my lower back. It wasn't anything too serious, but it did require some physical therapy and a few weeks of adjusting my routine. I was pretty grateful that it wasn't something worse, but it was a wake-up call. I realized I had been pushing through pain for a while without really listening to my body. Since then, I've been more careful about how I sit, stand, and lift things \u2014 and I've made a point to take more breaks throughout the day. I also started seeing a physical therapist twice a week, and it's been helping a lot. It's funny, though \u2014 I think the experience made me more in tune with my health in a way I wasn't before. I used to think I was doing okay just by showing up every day, but now I know that showing up in a healthy way matters just as much.\n\n",

There were days when I had to cancel meetings or take a break from grading papers because I was just too sore. I remember one afternoon when I was trying to help Liam with his homework and my back flared up so badly that I had to sit on the floor for a while just to catch my breath. It was humbling, to be honest \u2014 I used to think I was pretty tough, but that moment reminded me that my body has limits. What's funny is that it also brought my family closer. Tom started helping with more of the household tasks, and the kids learned to be more mindful of how I was feeling. It wasn't easy, but it taught me that health isn't just about being strong \u2014 it's about knowing when to slow down and ask for help.

It's been a year of transitions, both for me and for my family. Watching Liam take on more responsibility at home and in school has been incredible. He's becoming more confident, and I see pieces of myself in him \u2014 that same quiet determination, even if he's more outgoing than I was. Claire, on the other hand, has been navigating the ups and downs of middle school, which has been both challenging and rewarding. There were moments when I felt overwhelmed, especially with work and keeping up with their schedules, but I've also felt a sense of pride in how they're growing into their own people. I've also been focusing more on my own well-being, which has been a journey in itself. I started that painting class I mentioned earlier, and it's been a beautiful way to express myself and slow down.

But I don't think I'd call it depression or anxiety in the way some people describe it. For me, it's more about the quiet weight of responsibility and the pressure to keep going, even when things feel heavy. I remember there were days when I just wanted to sit in the kitchen and not move, but I had to push through for my family. Over the years, I've learned to recognize when I'm feeling that way and find little ways to cope \u2014 like journaling, talking to a friend, or just taking a walk. I think the biggest thing is that I've come to accept that it's okay to not be okay all the time.

I was raised Catholic, and I still respect the traditions and values that shaped me, especially the emphasis on compassion and community. But over the years, I've come to see spirituality more as a personal journey than something defined by doctrine. I find peace in things like nature, in the quiet moments with my family, and in the way life keeps unfolding, even when it's messy. I don't go to church regularly anymore, but I do light a candle on my kitchen table every Sunday, just like my mother used to. It's a small gesture, but it reminds me of where I came from and the strength it took to get here.

I do have a Facebook account, mostly to keep in touch with family and old friends, and I'll occasionally post a photo of the kids or a garden update if I feel like sharing. I used to be more active online when I was in college, but over time, I realized how much more meaningful my relationships became when I wasn't constantly comparing my life to others'.

I know it can be a lifeline for others, especially when they're going through something tough and need to connect with people who understand.

That said, I do appreciate the way Facebook has helped me stay in touch with friends and family, especially those who live far away.

Liam's soccer team had a season pass and some equipment costs, and Claire's drama club had a few performance fees and costume expenses. Then there's the mortgage, of course, and utilities, which always seem to add up, especially with the heating and cooling costs in Iowa.

The increase was mostly due to the kids' school activities \u2014 Liam's soccer season and Claire's drama club performances added up, and I had to cover some unexpected costs for his physical therapy sessions.

In the winter, heating costs always spike, and we had a particularly cold spell last January that made the bill jump by a couple hundred dollars. Then there's the summer \u2014 we use a lot of electricity for air conditioning, and with the kids' summer camps and activities, we ended up spending more on supplies and transportation. Holidays are another big one \u2014 we try to keep it simple, but there's always the cost of gifts, decorations, and maybe a family dinner out.

It's not always perfect, but I've come to see that balance as one of the most important things I can offer my family \u2014 and it's something I hope my kids will understand as they grow up.\n\n",

While I was in school, I worked part-time at that local bookstore, which was how I met Tom. It wasn't much \u2014 just a few hours a week \u2014 but it helped me pay for books and groceries. After I got my degree, I took on a second job during tax season, helping small businesses with their filings. It was stressful, but it gave me extra income and kept me sharp. For a while, I was juggling my full-time job at the accounting firm with some freelance work on the side, especially during the busy months. It wasn't easy \u2014 there were days when I felt like I was running on empty \u2014 but it taught me the value of hard work and the importance of finding a balance. Now, I'm more selective about taking on extra work, but I still do some freelance projects when I can. It's not about making more money \u2014 it's about staying connected to the work I love and making sure I'm always growing, even in small ways.\n\n",

Talking about my stress levels and coping strategies reminded me of how far I've come from the quiet girl at the kitchen table, learning to ask for help and practice mindfulness instead of pushing through everything alone. It also made me think about how my family has become my greatest source of strength \u2014 Tom's support, the kids' growing awareness of my needs, and the way we've all learned to lean on each other. I'm grateful for the lessons I've learned about balance, patience, and the value of being present, even when life feels overwhelming. It's not always easy, but I'm learning to take things one step at a time, knowing that I don't have to have all the answers \u2014 just the willingness to keep trying.",

That includes my full-time salary from the accounting firm, Tom's income from his job at the local engineering company, and the extra income I brought in from freelance tax work. It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our bills, save a little, and still have some room for things like groceries and the kids' activities. I've learned to be careful with money \u2014 not because I'm rich, but because I know how easily things can shift, especially with unexpected costs like medical bills or car repairs.

The benefits are pretty standard \u2014 health insurance, dental and vision coverage, paid time off, and sick days. I think the health benefits have been especially important, especially after my back injury. Knowing that I can see a doctor or physical therapist without worrying about the cost has been a huge relief. The paid time off is something I used to take for granted, but now I realize how much it helps with work-life balance. I've taken a few weeks off for family vacations and even a couple of days for personal wellness \u2014 things like yoga retreats or just a weekend getaway with Tom. I think the best part of the job is that it allows me to be there for my family without sacrificing my own well-being.

As for my coworkers, we get along well \u2014 we're all pretty busy, but there's a sense of camaraderie, especially during tax season when we're all pulling together to meet deadlines.

I'm usually in the office from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, and while there are occasional days when I have to stay late or come in early, especially during tax season, the core hours are pretty consistent. My manager has been great about offering some flexibility when needed, like allowing me to start a little later on days when I have doctor's appointments or when the kids have early morning activities.

It's not always easy, especially with the unexpected costs that come up, like medical bills or car repairs, but I've learned to be resourceful and plan ahead as best as I can.
