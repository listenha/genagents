Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nNicholas Aguirre: Well, I was born in Oregon, in a small town called Pacific, and I've lived in Eugene ever since I was 16. My parents are both pretty educated\u2014my dad has a bachelor's degree, and my mom has a graduate degree. We were never really poor, but we weren't rolling in money either. I grew up in a typical middle-class household, with both parents working. My mom was a teacher, and my dad worked in engineering. I never really had a lot of financial stress, which I think helped me focus on school. I wasn't the best student, but I did okay in high school. I didn't go to college because I wanted to start working and saving money. I've been working part-time at a local bookstore ever since I graduated. I'm not really into politics, but I lean a bit conservative, mostly because I value personal responsibility and individual freedom. I don't have any kids, and I've never been married. I'm pretty independent, and I like keeping things simple. I speak a little Spanish from my mom's side of the family, but I don't use it much anymore. I don't really follow any religion, and I've never served in the military. Life hasn't been too dramatic, but I'm content with where I am.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nNicholas Aguirre: Hmm, thinking about it, there was one moment that really shaped my path. I was about 18, right after I graduated high school. I had the option to go to community college, which my mom really encouraged me to do. She thought it would be a good way to get my feet wet with higher education before committing to a four-year program. But I was already working part-time at the bookstore, and I was saving up for a used car so I could move out on my own. I didn't want to take on more debt or spend another year in school when I felt like I was already gaining real experience. I remember talking to my dad about it, and he said something like, 'If you're not sure, it's better to take the time to figure it out than to rush into something you don't want.' That made me think. I ended up taking a year off, working full-time, and saving up enough to move into my own apartment. That decision gave me a sense of independence I wouldn't have had otherwise. I still wish I had gone to college, but I think I needed that time to grow on my own first. It taught me a lot about responsibility and making decisions based on what I wanted, not just what others expected.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nNicholas Aguirre: I think it was a conscious choice, even if it wasn't clear at the time. I didn't just wake up one day and decide to take a year off\u2014I weighed the options, talked it through with my parents, and thought about what I wanted for myself. I didn't want to feel like I was just going through the motions in college if I wasn't sure I wanted to be there. I wanted to be in control of my own path, even if it meant taking a different route than what was expected. I guess I've always believed that life is about making choices that align with who you are, not just following what others think you should do.\n\n",

I know my parents meant well, but they both came from a place of wanting the best for me, which sometimes made it hard for me to voice my own doubts. I wish I had spoken to a counselor or someone who worked with young adults making similar decisions. I think they could have helped me see the long-term implications of my choice more clearly. But honestly, I don't know if anyone could have changed my mind. I was pretty set on wanting to be independent, and I think that desire was stronger than any advice I might have gotten from someone else.\n\n",

My mom and dad are still in Eugene, and we keep in touch, though we don't see each other as often as I'd like. My mom still teaches at the same high school she's been at for years, and my dad is retired now, which gives him more time to spend on his hobbies, like woodworking and gardening. I visit them whenever I can, usually on weekends or holidays. I value family, but I also enjoy my independence. I don't see myself getting married anytime soon, and I'm not sure if I want kids.

I don't have any siblings, which I think is pretty common in our family\u2014my parents are both first-generation in a lot of ways, so they didn't have a lot of siblings themselves. I always felt like I had a close relationship with both of them, even if we didn't always agree on things. My mom was always the one who pushed me to think about my future, while my dad was more about giving me space to figure things out on my own. I think that balance helped me a lot. I don't have any other family members living nearby, but I do have a few cousins on my mom's side who live in California. We don't talk too often, but when we do, it's always nice to catch up.

One of them, Jordan, works at the same bookstore I do, and we've been friends for years. We've been through a lot together\u2014like figuring out our careers, dealing with the ups and downs of part-time jobs, and just trying to find our way in life. I also have a couple of friends from the community center where I sometimes volunteer. They're all pretty laid-back, like me, and we share a lot of the same values\u2014like independence and not wanting to be tied down by things we don't need. I don't have any romantic partners right now, and honestly, I don't think I'm in a rush for that. I like having my own space and being able to focus on my goals without any distractions.

It's a mix of older homes and some newer apartments, and there's a lot of green space around here. I rent a small one-bedroom apartment from an older couple who own a few properties in the area. They're pretty friendly, and I've gotten to know them a bit over the years. The neighborhood isn't too busy, which I like\u2014it gives me a sense of peace and quiet that I need after working at the bookstore.

I like that I can walk to the park, grab a coffee from the corner shop, and just enjoy the quiet. But there are downs too.

On the days I work, I usually wake up around 8 or 9, have a quick breakfast, and head into the store.

The job isn't too demanding, but I enjoy it because I get to be around books and meet people who share my love for reading.

I've been taking some basic courses in literature and history, mostly because I enjoy reading and I wanted to challenge myself a little.

I don't have any major issues, but I've been trying to take better care of myself lately. I used to skip meals when I was working long hours or forget to exercise altogether, but I've started making an effort to eat more regularly and go for walks by the river a few times a week. I've also been sleeping better, which helps a lot with my mood and energy levels. I don't really go to the doctor much unless something feels off, but I've been more proactive about checking in with myself. I think part of that has to do with getting older and realizing that taking care of your body is just as important as taking care of your mind. I don't have any chronic conditions or serious illnesses, but I do get the occasional cold or sore throat, like everyone else. I guess I'm in a good place health-wise\u2014no major concerns, just trying to stay on top of the little things so I can keep doing the things I enjoy, like reading, walking, and taking those evening classes.\n\n",

I did have a minor knee injury a while back from playing soccer with some friends, but it was nothing serious\u2014just a sprain that healed on its own after a few weeks.

At the same time, I've been trying to be more present in my daily life, whether it's enjoying the simple act of making a meal or taking a walk by the river and really noticing the details around me. I don't know if I'm happier, but I feel more grounded. There have been moments of doubt, of course\u2014times when I wonder if I'm stuck or if I'm just avoiding bigger decisions. But overall, I think I'm in a good place. I'm learning to accept that life doesn't have to be dramatic to be meaningful, and I'm okay with that for now.\n\n",

How about for you?\n\nNicholas Aguirre: I don't think I've ever struggled with depression or anxiety in a way that really impacted my daily life. There have been moments of feeling stuck or uncertain, especially when I was younger and trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. But I've always managed to push through by focusing on the things I enjoy\u2014like reading, walking, or just having a quiet evening at home. I think part of it is that I've never had a lot of pressure on me, either from work or from other people. I don't have a high-stress job, and I've never been in a situation where I felt like I had to perform or meet someone else's expectations. That said, I've definitely had days where I felt down or unmotivated, but I've always found ways to get back on track. I think I've learned to be kind to myself and not beat myself up over small things. I don't know if that's enough to call it mental health, but I feel like I've been pretty resilient overall.\n\n",

My mom has always been supportive, even when she didn't fully understand my decision to take a break from school. She's the kind of person who believes in education, so I think she worried I was missing out on something important. But she's never pushed me too hard\u2014she just let me know she was there if I ever wanted to talk. My dad, on the other hand, has always been more about giving me space. He's the kind of person who believes in learning through experience, so he never really questioned my choice. He just said, 'If you're doing what you think is right, then I support you.' That kind of balance between my mom's encouragement and my dad's trust has been really important for me. I think they've both seen me grow over the years, even if they don't always agree with the direction I'm taking. I feel lucky to have parents who care about me but also respect my independence. They've never made me feel like I had to follow a certain path, and I think that's given me the freedom to figure things out on my own.\n\n",

Groceries can add up, especially when I'm cooking more at home these days instead of eating out.

That's pretty much in line with what I usually spend each month. Rent takes up about $900, which is a big chunk, but it's manageable. Groceries come to around $400, and I try to be careful with that by buying in bulk and cooking at home. I also spend about $100 on utilities\u2014electricity, water, and internet.

I live in a small one-bedroom apartment on the east side of Eugene, just a few blocks from the river. It's not much, but it's comfortable and has everything I need. The rent is pretty reasonable for the area, and the landlord is a retired couple who own a few properties. They're pretty laid-back and don't bother me too much as long as I pay on time and keep the place in decent shape. I like the fact that I don't have a mortgage or any big financial obligations tied to a house\u2014I think that gives me more freedom to make choices without worrying about long-term commitments.

For example, during the winter months, my heating bill goes up a bit, and I've noticed that my electricity usage increases when I'm using the space heater more. On the flip side, in the summer, I use less heating but end up spending a little more on groceries because I tend to buy more fresh produce and eat more meals at home. There's also the holiday season, which brings a few extra expenses\u2014like a small gift for my parents or a nice dinner out with friends.

It's not a lot, but it's enough to cover my rent, groceries, and the small things I enjoy\u2014like buying a new book or grabbing coffee with a friend. I don't need much to be happy, and I think that's part of why I've been able to stay content with my current situation. I also set aside about $100 each month for savings or unexpected expenses, just in case. It's not a huge amount, but it gives me a sense of security, and I think that's enough for now.\n\n",

It's been a long time, but I don't feel like I've been there forever. The benefits of the job aren't exactly traditional\u2014there's no health insurance or paid vacation days, but I think that's part of what makes it work for me. I don't need a lot of structure or perks; I value the flexibility and the freedom to set my own schedule. I get a few days off each week, and I can take time off when I need to without too much hassle. The store owner is pretty understanding, and I've built a good relationship with her over the years. She's like a second mother to me in a way\u2014she knows my habits, my preferences, and she gives me the space to be myself. I think the biggest benefit is the sense of community I feel there. It's not just a job; it's a place where I can connect with people who share my love for books and storytelling. That kind of connection is something I don't think you can buy with a fancy benefits package, and I'm really grateful for it.\n\n",

She gives me a lot of freedom, which I really appreciate, and she's always been understanding if I need to take a day off or adjust my hours. As for my coworkers, we're all pretty laid-back, which fits with the vibe of the store. There's Jordan, who I mentioned before\u2014he's been my friend for years, and we work well together. Then there's Clara, who's newer but has a great sense of humor and always knows how to lighten the mood. We don't have any major conflicts, and we all get along pretty well. I think it's because we all share a love for books and the kind of quiet, thoughtful environment the store offers. It's not a high-pressure job, and that makes it easier to build good relationships. I feel like I'm part of a small, close-knit team, and that makes the work feel more like a community effort than just a job.\n\n",

I usually work the same days each week\u2014Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays\u2014but the hours can vary depending on how busy the store is. Some days I might start at 2 p.m. and finish by 8 p.m., while on others, especially weekends, I might stay a bit later if there's a special event or a lot of customers. The store owner, Ms. Harper, trusts me to manage my own time, which I really appreciate. It gives me the freedom to take days off when I need to or to adjust my hours if something comes up.

What I value more than money is the freedom to make my own choices, to live on my own terms, and to have the time to do the things I enjoy\u2014like reading, walking by the river, or taking those evening classes. I don't need a lot to be satisfied, and I think that's part of why I've been able to find peace with where I am. I know some people might look at my income and think I'm struggling, but I don't see it that way. I have a roof over my head, I can eat, I can save a little, and I have the flexibility to explore new things without feeling like I'm tied down by debt or a rigid schedule.

My bills don't fluctuate too much, which gives me a sense of control, and my savings, though small, provide me with a cushion that I can rely on.

She had a real passion for education, and I think that's why she stayed in the same school for so long. She was always the kind of teacher who stayed after class to help students who were struggling, and she made sure that every student felt seen and supported. My dad worked in engineering\u2014he was involved in designing infrastructure projects, like roads and bridges.
