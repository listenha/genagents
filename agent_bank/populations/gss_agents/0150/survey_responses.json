He mentions enjoying reading, walking by the river, and having quiet evenings at home. He also notes that he doesn't use social media much and doesn't feel the need to be part of online communities. These traits suggest he is more reserved and comfortable with solitude than being the center of attention.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Nicholas describes himself as independent, values close relationships with his family and friends, and has a stable, predictable life. He mentions that he has a small but close-knit group of friends and coworkers, and he values the relationships he has. While he doesn't explicitly mention trust, his behavior and attitude suggest a moderate level of trust in others. He doesn't seem overly skeptical or overly trusting, which suggests a middle ground.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Nicholas describes himself as someone who values independence, has a consistent routine, and is actively engaged in activities like reading, walking, and taking evening classes. He also reflects on his choices and growth, showing a sense of self-awareness and intentionality. These traits suggest he does not see himself as lazy. Instead, he is content with his current pace and makes deliberate efforts to maintain a balanced life.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Nicholas describes himself as someone who has learned to accept uncertainty and has developed coping strategies like reading, walking, and talking with friends. He also mentions that he feels more at peace with not knowing where his life is headed, which suggests a relaxed attitude. He has not experienced significant stress or anxiety that would interfere with his daily life, and he has a stable routine that supports his emotional well-being.",
            "BFI-10_5": "The participant mentioned being interested in photography and taking photos of the neighborhood and the river, which indicates an artistic interest. While he doesn't take it seriously, the fact that he engages in it as a creative outlet suggests he does have some artistic interest. This places him closer to the middle or higher end of the scale, but not at the highest level of artistic engagement.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Nicholas describes himself as independent, content with his routine, and not in a rush for relationships or marriage. He values quiet, familiar environments and has a small circle of close friends. While he does have a few close friends and enjoys community activities, he does not seem to seek out large social groups or frequent social interactions. He also mentions not being in a rush for romantic relationships, which suggests a more reserved or introverted personality.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Nicholas comes across as reflective, independent, and grounded. He values relationships and has a strong sense of self-awareness. He does not exhibit tendencies toward criticism or judgment of others. Instead, he focuses on his own growth, independence, and the positive aspects of his life. He also describes his relationships in a positive light, indicating a tendency to be understanding rather than critical.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Nicholas describes his work at the bookstore as involving organizing shelves, helping customers, and assisting with events. While he values his job and enjoys it, he doesn't emphasize meticulousness or detail-oriented work as a key part of his identity. He also mentions that he works part-time and values flexibility over perfection, which suggests he may not see himself as someone who prioritizes thoroughness above all else. However, he does show some level of responsibility and care in his work, which might place him in the middle of the range.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Nicholas describes himself as someone who has made deliberate, thoughtful choices in his life, often reflecting on his decisions and feeling content with his current path. He mentions feeling 'more at peace with not knowing' and not struggling with depression or anxiety. He also emphasizes his ability to manage stress through activities like reading, walking, and talking with friends. These traits suggest a generally calm and composed demeanor.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Nicholas mentions enjoying reading, photography, and taking evening classes, which are all activities that involve creativity and imagination. He also reflects deeply on his life and future, suggesting a thoughtful and imaginative mindset. However, he does not explicitly mention a strong focus on creative or imaginative activities, so his score is likely moderate."

He also mentions being able to connect with people at the bookstore and having meaningful interactions with friends.

He reflects on his life with a sense of self-awareness but does not mention being particularly attuned to others' emotions or being able to sense them without being told. His interactions with others seem grounded in shared interests and routine, not necessarily emotional insight.",
            "BES-A_6": "Nicholas describes himself as someone who is reflective, independent, and values quiet, stable interactions. He has a good relationship with his family and coworkers, and he is aware of others' emotions in his daily life (e.g., he knows his coworkers by name and enjoys connecting with people who share his interests). While he doesn’t seem overly expressive or socially driven, he does show an ability to understand and engage with others, which suggests he is somewhat attuned to their emotional states.",

He seems more introspective and focused on his own life rather than deeply reading others' emotions. However, he does have close friendships and appears to be emotionally grounded, which suggests he may be somewhat aware of others' feelings, though not necessarily highly skilled at detecting anger quickly.",
            "BES-A_8": "Nicholas describes having close friends with whom he keeps in touch, and he values relationships, even if he doesn't rush into romantic partnerships. He mentions spending time with friends, working alongside them, and having meaningful interactions. This suggests he is at least somewhat aware of his friends' feelings, though he may not be overly focused on emotional awareness. He does not appear to be emotionally detached or uninterested in others' feelings, but he also doesn't emphasize deep emotional connection as a priority in his life.",
            "BES-A_9": "Nicholas describes having close friends and mentions keeping in touch with them, which suggests he has meaningful social connections. He also reflects on his relationships and values them, indicating a degree of emotional awareness. However, he does not explicitly mention being particularly attuned to his friends' emotions or having trouble interpreting them. Given his introspective nature and the lack of direct evidence of emotional misinterpretation, a middle score seems most likely."

He makes decisions based on personal values and experiences rather than a strong emphasis on logical analysis. He also mentions that he weighed his options carefully when deciding not to go to college, but this seems more reflective and intuitive than strictly logical.

He also discusses how he weighed options and thought about what he wanted for himself. This shows he is reflective and can explain his decisions, aligning more with a higher score on this scale."

            "REI_1": "Nicholas describes himself as someone who values simplicity, independence, and a steady routine. While he mentions taking evening classes and engaging in reflective thinking, he also acknowledges that he is not in a rush to make major life decisions or pursue traditional paths. He does not express confidence in solving complex problems, nor does he describe himself as someone who actively seeks out or thrives on tackling difficult challenges. Instead, he seems content with his current situation and values stability over complexity.",
            "REI_2": "Nicholas describes himself as someone who values simplicity, independence, and reflection. He works at a bookstore, enjoys reading, and takes evening classes, but there is no indication he engages in tasks that require complex logical analysis. He seems more oriented toward creativity, routine, and personal reflection rather than structured problem-solving. This aligns more with someone who might feel less confident in logical analysis tasks.",
            "REI_3": "Nicholas describes himself as someone who values simplicity, independence, and personal experience over structured paths. He reflects on his life with a focus on emotional and intuitive aspects (e.g., 'I feel more at peace with not knowing,' 'I value the quiet moments').

He does not show a strong inclination toward structured problem-solving or data analysis in his work or personal life.",
            "REI_4": "Nicholas demonstrates thoughtful reflection throughout the interview, often weighing options, considering long-term implications, and making deliberate choices (e.g., taking a year off from school, choosing part-time work over college, and enrolling in evening classes). He also reflects on his life, values, and decisions in a measured and introspective way, which suggests he does engage in careful reasoning.",
            "REI_5": "Nicholas describes himself as someone who values stability, simplicity, and independence. He does not mention experiencing significant stress or pressure in his life, and he has made deliberate, thoughtful choices rather than impulsive ones. He also reflects on his life with a sense of contentment and control, which suggests he does not feel overwhelmed or ineffective under pressure.",
            "REI_6": "Nicholas describes himself as someone who values independence, simplicity, and reflection. While he does engage in thoughtful decision-making, such as weighing options before choosing to take a year off from school, he does not emphasize logical reasoning as a core strength. His narrative suggests a more intuitive, reflective, and experience-based approach to life rather than a strictly logical one.",
            "REI_7": "Nicholas describes himself as someone who values simplicity, independence, and personal reflection.
