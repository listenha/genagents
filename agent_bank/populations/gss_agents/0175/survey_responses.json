            "BFI-10_1": "Katherine describes herself as introverted, preferring meaningful conversations over large gatherings, and valuing independence and quiet simplicity. She mentions not seeking out a lot of social interaction and enjoying activities like reading, hiking, and volunteering, which are solitary or low-key. This suggests she is more reserved and introspective, aligning with a lower score on the scale.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Katherine describes herself as independent, focused on her career, and values self-reliance. She has a close relationship with her mother but a distant one with her father. She does not mention having many close friends or trusting relationships outside of family. Her life seems structured and cautious, with a focus on personal stability rather than relying on others. This suggests a more cautious or skeptical view of others, which aligns more with a lower score on the trusting scale.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Katherine describes herself as someone with a strong work ethic, who has worked part-time during high school, graduated with a bachelor's degree, and is currently working full-time as a customer service manager. She emphasizes her independence, responsibility, and dedication to her career. She also mentions setting routines, managing stress, and being intentional with her time. These traits are inconsistent with seeing herself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Katherine mentions experiencing occasional anxiety, particularly when work gets overwhelming, and she has learned to manage it through routine, exercise, and journaling. While she is not someone who struggles with severe stress, she also does not describe herself as someone who is always relaxed or handles stress effortlessly. She acknowledges her stress and takes deliberate steps to manage it, which suggests she is somewhere in the middle of the range, but closer to the lower end since she still feels the effects of stress and is working to improve.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Based on the interview, Katherine Wright does not mention any artistic interests or activities. She describes her life as focused on work, independence, and practicality. Her hobbies include reading, hiking, and volunteering, none of which are artistic in nature. She also does not mention engaging with creative activities like music, painting, or writing. This suggests she likely identifies more with the lower end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Katherine describes herself as introverted, preferring meaningful conversations over large gatherings. She mentions having a few close friends and valuing quiet, simple living. She also states that she doesn't need much to be happy and enjoys activities like reading, hiking, and volunteering, which are often associated with introverted tendencies.

            "BFI-10_7": "Katherine describes herself as someone who values independence, hard work, and self-reliance. She reflects on her life with a sense of gratitude and contentment, and she emphasizes the importance of relationships built on support and respect. She does not come across as someone who is prone to finding fault with others. In fact, she highlights the positive influences in her life, such as her mother and a supportive teacher, and she seems to have a balanced, introspective view of her own life and the people around her.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Katherine consistently demonstrates a strong work ethic, a focus on responsibility, and a commitment to doing things well. She mentions taking on new responsibilities at work, managing her time effectively, and being proud of her career growth. She also shows a pattern of careful planning in her personal life, such as budgeting and saving, which suggests she values thoroughness and precision.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Katherine describes occasional anxiety, particularly when work gets overwhelming, but she also emphasizes her ability to manage it through routine, exercise, and mindfulness. She does not frame herself as someone who gets nervous easily, but rather as someone who experiences stress and anxiety in specific, manageable ways. This suggests she would rate herself closer to the lower end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Katherine describes herself as someone who values structure, independence, and practicality. She emphasizes her work ethic, routine, and focus on real-world responsibilities like her job, budgeting, and volunteering. While she mentions reading and reflecting on her life, there is no indication that she engages in imaginative or creative pursuits beyond these activities. Her personality and lifestyle seem more aligned with practicality and grounded thinking rather than a vivid, active imagination."

While she has a few close friends and values relationships, she doesn't engage in extensive social interaction. She also mentions that she prefers to handle things privately and relies on her mom and a few close friends for support. However, she doesn't describe having a deep understanding of her friends' emotional states or being particularly attuned to their fears. This suggests she may not be highly sensitive to others' emotions, leaning more toward the lower end of the scale.",
            "BES-A_3": "Katherine describes herself as someone who values independence, structure, and self-reliance. While she acknowledges moments of anxiety and stress, she does not frequently express a strong emotional connection to others' feelings. She relies on her own routines and faith for emotional support, rather than seeking or expressing deep empathy for others' emotional states. Her responses suggest she is more self-focused and grounded in her own experiences rather than deeply attuned to others' emotional struggles.",
            "BES-A_4": "Katherine describes herself as independent, focused on her own goals, and not one to rely on others for support. She values her own routines and emotional coping strategies, such as journaling and taking walks, rather than seeking external validation or support. While she is described as having close relationships with her mom and a few friends, she does not seem to be the type to take the lead in emotionally charged situations or to step in when others are scared. She prefers to handle things privately and independently, which suggests she would not rate herself highly on this statement.",
            "BES-A_5": "Katherine describes herself as introverted, valuing meaningful conversations over large gatherings, and preferring solitude or small interactions. She mentions having a few close friends and coworkers but doesn't emphasize a strong ability to read others' emotions. She also reflects on her life with a focus on independence and structure, rather than on emotional intuition or empathy. This suggests she may not score very high on this question.",

She reflects on her mother's influence, her own emotional coping strategies, and her ability to manage stress and anxiety. She also shows an understanding of others' emotions, such as when she talks about her sister's family life and her own appreciation for her mom's support. These traits suggest she is likely to be attuned to others' emotional states, including cheerfulness.",
            "BES-A_7": "Katherine describes herself as introverted, valuing meaningful conversations over large social gatherings. She mentions having a few close friends and coworkers she considers friends, but she doesn't have a large social circle. She also doesn't seem to engage in frequent or deep social interactions, which may suggest she is not as attuned to others' emotional states, especially in subtle or nonverbal ways. Her focus on independence and structure may also indicate a more self-centered perspective, which could align with a lower score on this question.",
            "BES-A_8": "Katherine describes herself as having a small social circle and preferring meaningful conversations over large gatherings. She values independence and is focused on her career and personal goals.

She mentions keeping in touch with friends from college and coworkers she considers friends, but she doesn't have a large social circle. While she values relationships, her personality and lifestyle suggest she may not be highly attuned to the emotional cues of others, especially in casual or less intimate interactions. However, she does have close relationships, which might suggest she is somewhat capable of recognizing her friends' emotions. Still, her focus on independence and quiet life suggests she may not prioritize reading others' emotions as much as others might."

While she reflects deeply on her life and decisions, her narrative doesn't emphasize analytical thinking or data-driven reasoning.

She often attributes her decisions to her values, her mother's influence, and her personal goals.
