            "BFI-10_2": "Based on the interview, Mason seems to have experienced significant challenges and losses, such as the death of his mother and financial pressures. These experiences might lead him to be more cautious and less trusting, but he also values community and support, which suggests some level of trust.

Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that Mason would lean towards the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_2": "Based on the interview, Mason describes himself as facing financial constraints and balancing multiple responsibilities, which suggests he is pragmatic and resourceful. He has managed to navigate these challenges and complete his studies, indicating a certain level of problem-solving ability. However, the statement specifically mentions 'careful logical analysis,' which might be less directly related to his day-to-day experiences. Given his focus on social issues and community service, he seems to value a broader set of skills beyond just logical analysis. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume he might agree with this statement but not strongly.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Mason describes himself as someone who has faced significant challenges and has had to make pragmatic decisions, often focusing on immediate realities rather than purely theoretical considerations. He does not mention having a strong inclination towards analytical thinking, and his focus seems more on practical outcomes and community engagement. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Mason would place himself closer to the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_4": "Based on the interview, Mason seems to have a pragmatic and practical approach to life. He has made several important decisions, such as choosing to go to community college instead of a four-year university, which shows he can make thoughtful choices. However, he also mentions that it felt like a mixture of conscious decision-making and necessity, indicating that he may not always reason things out carefully. Mason's comments about feeling overwhelmed by stress and relying on coping strategies like journaling and setting boundaries suggest he values some form of careful reasoning, but it's not necessarily his strongest point.",
            "REI_5": "Based on the interview, Mason has faced significant challenges, including the loss of his mother and financial pressures. These experiences have likely made him more aware of his limitations in handling stress. He has described feeling stressed and overwhelmed at times, especially during the past year. This suggests he would be more inclined to choose a lower number on the scale, indicating he struggles with reasoning well under pressure.",
            "REI_6": "Based on the interview, Mason appears to be someone who values education and critical thinking, as evidenced by his pursuit of a sociology degree and his active engagement in social justice causes. He seems to have a clear sense of purpose and is committed to making a positive impact in his community. These traits suggest that Mason likely has a strong belief in his logical reasoning abilities, which would lead him to choose a higher number on the scale.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the interview, Mason describes himself as someone who has faced significant challenges and made thoughtful decisions, suggesting a level of logical thinking. He is also pursuing a degree in sociology, which involves a fair amount of logical analysis and reasoning. However, he has also expressed moments of self-doubt and emotional challenges, indicating that he may not always feel completely confident in his logical abilities. Given these factors, a moderate score seems fitting.",
            "REI_8": "Based on the interview, Mason demonstrates a thoughtful and reflective approach to his decisions and daily life. He has been making choices that balance long-term goals with immediate realities, and he mentions seeking support and considering his options carefully. This suggests he values careful thinking and deliberation.",
            "REI_9": "Based on the interview, Mason seems to have a balanced approach to problem-solving. He has faced significant challenges, such as the loss of his mother and financial constraints, which might make him appreciate the importance of both logical and emotional approaches. However, his commitment to education and his willingness to seek support and make decisions that align with his goals suggests a certain level of confidence in using logical reasoning. Therefore, he is likely to lean towards the middle of the scale, acknowledging the effectiveness of logic without overemphasizing it.",
            "REI_10": "Based on the interview, Mason has shown a thoughtful and reflective approach to his decisions, particularly in discussing his choices regarding education and work. He often explains his reasoning and acknowledges the importance of making informed decisions, even when they are influenced by external factors like financial constraints. This indicates a higher likelihood of choosing 5."
