Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nMason Araya: Well, my journey began in Boise, Idaho, where I grew up in a small mountain town not far from the city. I lived with my parents, who both worked hard to provide for us. My dad was a teacher at the local high school, having earned his Bachelor's degree, while my mom was a professor at the university. She has a Master's degree, and she also had a Ph.D. in progress when she passed away a few years ago. It was a tough time, but it taught me the importance of resilience and education. I was always close to my mom; we shared a love for books and discussions about social issues.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nMason Araya: One such moment came during my senior year of high school. I was faced with the decision of whether to pursue a community college or attend a four-year university. My mom had always encouraged me to aim high, and she believed that a bachelor's degree would be crucial for my future. But with her passing, the financial burden became heavier on my father alone. I remember sitting in our living room, surrounded by her books and notes, trying to decide which path to take. In the end, I chose the community college, hoping to save money and still get a good education. It was a tough choice, but it taught me the value of making decisions that align with both my goals and my circumstances.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nMason Araya: It felt like a mixture of both. There were moments when I consciously weighed the pros and cons, thinking about how each path would impact my future. But ultimately, the decision was driven by the reality of our financial situation. I knew that a community college would allow me to start earning credits and potentially transfer later, which aligned with my long-term goal of getting a bachelor's degree. It was a bittersweet choice, but one that I felt was necessary at the time.\n\n",

However, even with his best efforts, the costs were still daunting. It was a tough period, and sometimes I wondered if I was making the right choice. But looking back, I'm grateful for the lessons learned and the sense of independence I gained from making that decision on my own.\n\n",

There have been times when the demands of school and work felt overwhelming, but I've been focusing more on implementing coping strategies that have really helped. I've started journaling more, which allows me to express my thoughts and feelings without judgment. I've also been more intentional about setting boundaries at work and school, making sure to allocate specific times for studying and relaxation. Additionally, I've been participating in a support group for students, which has been incredibly beneficial. Being able to share my experiences and challenges with others who understand has been a huge relief. Overall, I feel like I'm managing my stress better, and I'm more equipped to handle whatever comes my way.\n\n",

Then there was the cost of groceries, which came to around $300, and my part-time job at the bookstore gave me about $600 in income. I also spent some money on books for my classes, which totaled around $100.

In the summer, when school isn't in full swing, my expenses tend to be lower because I can focus more on saving. Winter, however, brings higher utility bills due to the cold weather, and there are also additional costs around holidays and special events.
