            "BFI-10_1": "Cynthia describes herself as a quiet kid who preferred books and music over socializing, and she often mentions feeling more comfortable in introspective moments, like reading on her porch or walking in the park. She also reflects on how she was more of an introvert growing up and how she values quiet, meaningful connections over large social interactions. These characteristics align closely with identifying as reserved.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Cynthia Williams comes across as someone who values her close relationships with family and friends, and she expresses trust in the people she knows, such as her mother, sister, and friends like Aisha and Jamal. She also mentions feeling safe in her neighborhood and relying on her community for support. While she has not explicitly mentioned her level of trust in others, her openness to help from others, her reliance on her support system, and her willingness to engage with people in her life suggest a moderate to high level of trust.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Cynthia describes herself as someone who is working part-time, taking online classes, and actively trying to improve her life despite financial and personal challenges. She reflects on her growth, her efforts to take small steps toward her goals, and her commitment to her family. These traits indicate a strong work ethic and motivation, which align more with a low score on the 'lazy' scale.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Cynthia mentioned experiencing anxiety and feeling uncertain about her future, which suggests she does not always handle stress well. She also described moments of feeling stuck and overwhelmed, which aligns more with a lower score on this scale. While she has developed coping strategies like journaling, walking, and talking to friends, she also acknowledged that she still struggles with stress and uncertainty.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Cynthia mentions being interested in books and music, and she has a connection to music through her brother. She also works at a bookstore and participates in events like poetry nights, which suggests some level of engagement with artistic or literary interests. While she may not identify as highly artistic, she clearly has some appreciation for creative expression. This suggests she would likely rate herself somewhere in the middle, but not at the extreme end of having few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Cynthia describes herself as quiet, more interested in books and music than in sports or parties, and mentions that she is an introvert. She also notes that she doesn't have a large social circle, though she values the relationships she does have. While she has friends and coworkers she cares about, she doesn't actively seek out social situations or describe herself as outgoing.",

She discusses her own struggles with anxiety and uncertainty, and she consistently emphasizes the importance of support from her family and friends. She also shows gratitude for the people in her life and acknowledges the value of community and patience. There is no indication that she tends to find fault with others; instead, she reflects on her own journey with humility and self-awareness.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Cynthia describes herself as someone who is thoughtful, reflective, and takes time to make decisions, such as choosing to take a gap year to reflect on her future. She also mentions small, deliberate actions like journaling, stretching, and taking online classes, which suggest she values thoroughness in her approach to life. However, she also acknowledges that she sometimes feels stuck or unsure, which may imply she doesn't always feel confident in her ability to complete tasks thoroughly.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Cynthia mentioned struggling with anxiety, particularly during times of uncertainty, such as after high school or when juggling work, school, and family responsibilities. She described feeling 'stuck in my own head' and having moments where she felt overwhelmed. While she also mentioned learning to manage it and being kinder to herself, her self-reported experiences align more with a moderate to high level of nervousness.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Cynthia mentions being interested in books and music from a young age, and she reflects on her childhood with a sense of imagination and creativity. She also talks about writing and being encouraged to try writing by her friend Aisha. While she doesn't explicitly describe herself as having a very active imagination, her engagement with books, her introspective nature, and her reflections on music and storytelling suggest a moderate to high level of imagination."

She also mentions being introspective and reflective, which suggests she is in tune with others' emotions. This indicates she is likely empathetic and able to recognize when her friends are frightened.",
            "BES-A_3": "Cynthia has demonstrated a strong ability to reflect on her own emotions and those of her family and friends. She discusses her anxiety and uncertainty openly, and she shows empathy toward her family's concerns and her friends' experiences. She also acknowledges the importance of support systems and has a good understanding of emotional struggles, which suggests she is able to understand others' feelings when they are down.",
            "BES-A_4": "Cynthia describes herself as someone who values her friends and family deeply and is reflective about her emotional state. She has a strong support system and has mentioned relying on friends like Aisha and coworkers like Jamal for support. She also shows empathy and understanding for others, as seen in her reflections on her family and community. However, she also mentions that she tends to be introspective and sometimes struggles with anxiety, which may make her less likely to take the lead in comforting others. Still, she is aware of the importance of support and connection, which suggests she would be somewhat capable of helping her friends when they are scared, but not necessarily the most proactive.",
            "BES-A_5": "Cynthia describes herself as quiet, introspective, and more interested in books and music than in social interactions. She mentions having close friends like Aisha and coworkers like Jamal, but she also notes that she is more of an introvert. While she is aware of others' feelings and has supportive relationships, she does not explicitly describe herself as someone who can intuitively sense others' emotions before they are expressed. Her empathy seems more reflective and based on personal connections rather than an innate ability to read others' emotions.",
            "BES-A_6": "Cynthia describes herself as introverted and more comfortable with quiet moments, such as reading on her porch or walking in the park. She also mentions that she values her family and friends but does not rely heavily on social interactions to motivate her. She seems to be more self-driven and reflective, suggesting she may not be easily influenced by the cheerfulness of others when deciding to work out.",
            "BES-A_7": "Cynthia describes herself as an introvert who is more interested in books and music than in social interactions. She also mentions that she is quiet and more reflective, which suggests she may not be as attuned to others' emotions in real-time. While she has close friends like Aisha and Jamal, she doesn't describe herself as someone who is particularly skilled at reading others' emotions quickly. Her introspective nature and tendency to reflect rather than act on social cues may lead her to score lower on this item.",
            "BES-A_8": "Cynthia describes having close relationships with friends like Aisha and Jamal, and she mentions that they have been important to her over the years. She also talks about how Aisha encouraged her to write and how Jamal supported her during a difficult time. This suggests that she is aware of her friends' feelings and values their emotional connection. She does not appear to be emotionally distant or self-focused.",
            "BES-A_9": "Cynthia describes herself as having a close relationship with her friend Aisha, who she says understands her even when she is quiet and reserved. She also mentions that Aisha encourages her and reads her writing. This suggests that Cynthia has meaningful, emotionally attuned relationships. Additionally, she is reflective and in tune with her own emotions, which likely extends to her ability to read others’ emotions, including her friends’ happiness."

            "BFI-10_1": "Cynthia describes herself as a quiet kid who preferred books and music over social activities. She mentions being introverted and not having a large social circle. She also reflects on how she used to feel more reserved and introspective, especially during her teenage years. While she has grown more connected with friends like Aisha and Jamal, she still identifies with being quiet and reflective, which aligns with a more reserved self-perception.",

She mentions feeling safe in her neighborhood and relying on her family and friends for support. These traits suggest a level of trust in others, though she also shows some caution in her life choices, such as not using social media much and being careful with her health.

            "BFI-10_3": "Cynthia describes herself as someone who is working part-time, taking online classes, and making small but consistent efforts to improve her life. She reflects on her past decisions, such as taking a gap year to save money and prepare for community college, which shows a sense of responsibility and intentionality. She also mentions her desire to support her family and move forward in her education, which indicates a strong work ethic and motivation. These traits suggest she would not see herself as lazy.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Cynthia mentioned experiencing anxiety and feeling uncertain about her future, which suggests she does not always handle stress well. She also described days when she felt stuck and overwhelmed, even if she was trying to manage her emotions through small coping strategies like journaling or walking. While she is making progress, she hasn't fully developed a consistent way to remain relaxed under pressure.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Cynthia mentions in the interview that she enjoys music, has a brother who introduced her to various genres, and even plays the guitar. She also references books and reading, and she has taken steps to engage with creative spaces like poetry nights at the bookstore. These indicate that she has some level of artistic interest, though not necessarily a strong or central identity around it. However, she does not express a deep or defining connection to art, so she is more likely to fall in the middle or lower range.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Cynthia describes herself as quiet, introverted, and more interested in books and music than in sports or parties. She mentions having a few close friends but not a large social circle. While she has a few important relationships, she does not engage in frequent or large-scale social activities. This suggests she is more introverted and less likely to identify as outgoing or sociable.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Cynthia describes herself as someone who is introspective, kind, and values relationships with her family and friends. She shows empathy and understanding toward others, as seen in her reflections on her family, friends, and coworkers.

There is no indication that she is judgmental or critical of others, which suggests she would not identify with the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Cynthia describes her life with a sense of responsibility and reflection. She mentions taking time to think through decisions, such as choosing to take a gap year to reflect on her future, and she values small, consistent steps toward growth.

            "BFI-10_9": "Cynthia mentioned experiencing anxiety, particularly around uncertainty about her future and the pressure to make decisions. She described feeling stuck and having moments of doubt, which aligns with a tendency to get nervous easily. However, she also showed resilience and was working on managing her emotions, which suggests she might not score at the very highest end of the scale. Her self-awareness and efforts to cope indicate a moderate level of nervousness.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Cynthia mentions being interested in books and music from a young age, and she reflects on her childhood with vivid imagery (e.g., 'dreaming about what I wanted to be when I grew up'). She also shows a reflective and creative side when she writes in her journal and talks about her future. While she doesn't explicitly say she has an active imagination, her introspective nature and engagement with creative activities suggest she does."
