            "BFI-10_1": "Cynthia describes herself as a quiet kid who preferred books and music over socializing, and she often mentions feeling more comfortable in introspective moments, like reading on her porch or walking in the park. She also reflects on how she was more of an introvert growing up and how she values quiet, meaningful connections over large social interactions. These characteristics align closely with identifying as reserved.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Cynthia Williams comes across as someone who values her close relationships with family and friends, and she expresses trust in the people she knows, such as her mother, sister, and friends like Aisha and Jamal. She also mentions feeling safe in her neighborhood and relying on her community for support. While she has not explicitly mentioned her level of trust in others, her openness to help from others, her reliance on her support system, and her willingness to engage with people in her life suggest a moderate to high level of trust.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Cynthia describes herself as someone who is working part-time, taking online classes, and actively trying to improve her life despite financial and personal challenges. She reflects on her growth, her efforts to take small steps toward her goals, and her commitment to her family. These traits indicate a strong work ethic and motivation, which align more with a low score on the 'lazy' scale.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Cynthia mentioned experiencing anxiety and feeling uncertain about her future, which suggests she does not always handle stress well. She also described moments of feeling stuck and overwhelmed, which aligns more with a lower score on this scale. While she has developed coping strategies like journaling, walking, and talking to friends, she also acknowledged that she still struggles with stress and uncertainty.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Cynthia mentions being interested in books and music, and she has a connection to music through her brother. She also works at a bookstore and participates in events like poetry nights, which suggests some level of engagement with artistic or literary interests. While she may not identify as highly artistic, she clearly has some appreciation for creative expression. This suggests she would likely rate herself somewhere in the middle, but not at the extreme end of having few artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Cynthia describes herself as quiet, more interested in books and music than in sports or parties, and mentions that she is an introvert. She also notes that she doesn't have a large social circle, though she values the relationships she does have. While she has friends and coworkers she cares about, she doesn't actively seek out social situations or describe herself as outgoing.",

She discusses her own struggles with anxiety and uncertainty, and she consistently emphasizes the importance of support from her family and friends. She also shows gratitude for the people in her life and acknowledges the value of community and patience. There is no indication that she tends to find fault with others; instead, she reflects on her own journey with humility and self-awareness.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Cynthia describes herself as someone who is thoughtful, reflective, and takes time to make decisions, such as choosing to take a gap year to reflect on her future. She also mentions small, deliberate actions like journaling, stretching, and taking online classes, which suggest she values thoroughness in her approach to life. However, she also acknowledges that she sometimes feels stuck or unsure, which may imply she doesn't always feel confident in her ability to complete tasks thoroughly.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Cynthia mentioned struggling with anxiety, particularly during times of uncertainty, such as after high school or when juggling work, school, and family responsibilities. She described feeling 'stuck in my own head' and having moments where she felt overwhelmed. While she also mentioned learning to manage it and being kinder to herself, her self-reported experiences align more with a moderate to high level of nervousness.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Cynthia mentions being interested in books and music from a young age, and she reflects on her childhood with a sense of imagination and creativity. She also talks about writing and being encouraged to try writing by her friend Aisha. While she doesn't explicitly describe herself as having a very active imagination, her engagement with books, her introspective nature, and her reflections on music and storytelling suggest a moderate to high level of imagination."

She also mentions being introspective and reflective, which suggests she is in tune with others' emotions. This indicates she is likely empathetic and able to recognize when her friends are frightened.",
            "BES-A_3": "Cynthia has demonstrated a strong ability to reflect on her own emotions and those of her family and friends. She discusses her anxiety and uncertainty openly, and she shows empathy toward her family's concerns and her friends' experiences. She also acknowledges the importance of support systems and has a good understanding of emotional struggles, which suggests she is able to understand others' feelings when they are down.",
            "BES-A_4": "Cynthia describes herself as someone who values her friends and family deeply and is reflective about her emotional state. She has a strong support system and has mentioned relying on friends like Aisha and coworkers like Jamal for support. She also shows empathy and understanding for others, as seen in her reflections on her family and community. However, she also mentions that she tends to be introspective and sometimes struggles with anxiety, which may make her less likely to take the lead in comforting others. Still, she is aware of the importance of support and connection, which suggests she would be somewhat capable of helping her friends when they are scared, but not necessarily the most proactive.",
            "BES-A_5": "Cynthia describes herself as quiet, introspective, and more interested in books and music than in social interactions. She mentions having close friends like Aisha and coworkers like Jamal, but she also notes that she is more of an introvert. While she is aware of others' feelings and has supportive relationships, she does not explicitly describe herself as someone who can intuitively sense others' emotions before they are expressed. Her empathy seems more reflective and based on personal connections rather than an innate ability to read others' emotions.",
            "BES-A_6": "Cynthia describes herself as introverted and more comfortable with quiet moments, such as reading on her porch or walking in the park. She also mentions that she values her family and friends but does not rely heavily on social interactions to motivate her. She seems to be more self-driven and reflective, suggesting she may not be easily influenced by the cheerfulness of others when deciding to work out.",
            "BES-A_7": "Cynthia describes herself as an introvert who is more interested in books and music than in social interactions. She also mentions that she is quiet and more reflective, which suggests she may not be as attuned to others' emotions in real-time. While she has close friends like Aisha and Jamal, she doesn't describe herself as someone who is particularly skilled at reading others' emotions quickly. Her introspective nature and tendency to reflect rather than act on social cues may lead her to score lower on this item.",
            "BES-A_8": "Cynthia describes having close relationships with friends like Aisha and Jamal, and she mentions that they have been important to her over the years. She also talks about how Aisha encouraged her to write and how Jamal supported her during a difficult time. This suggests that she is aware of her friends' feelings and values their emotional connection. She does not appear to be emotionally distant or self-focused.",
            "BES-A_9": "Cynthia describes herself as having a close relationship with her friend Aisha, who she says understands her even when she is quiet and reserved. She also mentions that Aisha encourages her and reads her writing. This suggests that Cynthia has meaningful, emotionally attuned relationships. Additionally, she is reflective and in tune with her own emotions, which likely extends to her ability to read others’ emotions, including her friends’ happiness."

Instead, she appears to handle stress with a calm, reflective approach.",
            "REI_6": "Cynthia describes herself as someone who takes time to reflect and make decisions thoughtfully, but she also acknowledges uncertainty and the value of small, consistent steps. She does not present herself as someone who excels in logical reasoning or problem-solving in a highly structured way. Instead, she emphasizes intuition, reflection, and emotional support from others. This suggests she would not rate herself as significantly better than others in logical reasoning.",

However, she also emphasizes that her decisions are often guided by a sense of responsibility, family values, and emotional considerations, rather than strict logical analysis.

She describes her choices as being guided by a 'quiet moment of clarity' and 'small, consistent steps,' which suggests she does consider her reasons, even if not always in a dramatic or grand way. She also acknowledges the influence of her family and values, which contribute to her decision-making process. This indicates she is more aligned with a middle to higher score on the scale."

While she is thoughtful and reflective, she does not emphasize logical analysis or problem-solving as a core part of her identity. She often speaks about taking small steps and relying on intuition or emotional support rather than complex reasoning. This suggests she may not see herself as particularly strong in logical analysis.",
            "REI_3": "Cynthia describes herself as reflective, thoughtful, and someone who values small, consistent steps in her life. While she is introspective and values community and personal connections, she does not explicitly engage in detailed analysis or problem-solving in her daily life. She tends to rely on her experiences and the support of her family and friends rather than breaking down complex issues into logical components. This suggests she is more aligned with the idea that she is not a very analytical thinker.",
            "REI_4": "Cynthia demonstrates thoughtful reflection throughout the interview, often considering her decisions carefully and weighing options before acting. She reflects on her choices, like taking a gap year, and acknowledges the importance of small, deliberate steps in her life. This suggests she values careful reasoning and would likely disagree with the statement.",
            "REI_5": "Cynthia describes herself as someone who takes time to reflect, makes thoughtful decisions, and often feels the need to move forward at her own pace. She also mentions feeling uncertain or stuck at times and having to manage stress through small, grounding activities. These traits suggest she may not thrive under pressure and might struggle with quick decision-making or thinking clearly in high-stress situations.",
            "REI_6": "Cynthia describes herself as someone who takes time to reflect, values small steps, and often makes decisions based on thoughtful consideration rather than quick, logical deductions. She acknowledges uncertainty and doesn't frame her decisions as purely logical. Instead, she emphasizes emotional and relational factors, like family support and community, which suggests she doesn't see herself as especially strong in logical reasoning compared to others.",
            "REI_7": "Cynthia describes herself as reflective, thoughtful, and deliberate in her decisions, but she also emphasizes emotional and intuitive aspects of her life, such as her connection to her family, her quiet moments of reflection, and her emotional coping strategies. While she is thoughtful and methodical in her approach to life (e.g., taking small steps, planning for the future), she does not explicitly demonstrate a strong preference for logical or analytical thinking over emotional or intuitive processes.",

She also mentions making quiet, deliberate choices and not rushing into things. Her personality seems to align with someone who thinks carefully before acting.",
            "REI_9": "Cynthia describes herself as someone who makes decisions thoughtfully but not through dramatic epiphanies. She often reflects on her choices and values small, consistent steps over grand plans. While she does use logic to some extent (e.g., balancing work, family, and education), she also relies on emotional support from family and friends, and she admits to feeling uncertain or stuck at times. This suggests she may not always rely heavily on logic alone to solve problems.",
            "REI_10": "Cynthia often reflects on her decisions and describes them as thoughtful and deliberate, such as her choice to take a gap year to work and save for community college. She also emphasizes the importance of family, responsibility, and small steps toward the future, which suggests she considers her decisions carefully and can explain them. However, she also acknowledges uncertainty and the influence of external factors like her family and environment, which may make her less certain about the clarity of her reasoning."

She mentions being introverted and preferring to sit on her porch or walk in the park rather than engage in large social gatherings. She also reflects on how she didn’t feel the need to be the center of attention or rush into decisions, which aligns with a reserved personality. While she has friends and coworkers, she doesn’t describe herself as someone who actively seeks out social interactions or expresses herself openly.",

            "BFI-10_4": "Cynthia has described feeling anxiety and uncertainty, particularly around her future and balancing work, family, and education. She also mentioned that she has been learning to manage her stress through small coping strategies like walking, journaling, and talking to friends. While she is not entirely relaxed or stress-free, she is actively working on improving her emotional resilience. This suggests she would not rate herself a 5, but she also doesn't seem to be completely overwhelmed, which would be a 1. A score of 3 seems most accurate, as she is in the process of learning and growing in this area.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Cynthia mentions being interested in books and music, and she has a connection to music through her brother. She also works at a bookstore and has started helping with poetry nights, which suggests some engagement with artistic or literary interests. While she doesn't describe herself as deeply artistic, she does have some involvement with creative activities, which suggests she might not score very low on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Cynthia describes herself as an introvert who prefers quiet moments, such as reading on her porch or walking in the park. She mentions having a small circle of close friends and coworkers but does not engage in large social gatherings or express a desire to be the center of attention. Her interactions with others are described as thoughtful and meaningful rather than frequent or energetic. This aligns more with a low score on the outgoing and sociable scale.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Cynthia Williams comes across as reflective, kind, and focused on personal growth and community. She speaks highly of her family and friends, shows gratitude, and emphasizes the importance of support and understanding. She does not exhibit tendencies to criticize or find fault with others, instead focusing on her own journey and the people who support her. Her narrative is centered on self-improvement and community, not on pointing out flaws in others.",
            "BFI-10_8": "Cynthia describes herself as someone who is thoughtful, responsible, and takes time to reflect on her decisions. She is described as working part-time at a bookstore, where she has taken on additional responsibilities like organizing events, and she is also taking online classes and attending community workshops. These actions suggest she is detail-oriented and committed to doing her work well. While she doesn't present herself as overly confident or perfectionistic, she consistently shows a pattern of careful planning and responsibility, which aligns more with a higher score.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Cynthia mentioned experiencing anxiety, particularly around uncertainty about her future and the pressure to make decisions. She described feeling 'stuck in my own head' and having 'quiet uncertainty' about her path. While she has been learning to manage it, she has not described herself as someone who is generally calm or confident. This suggests she would lean toward the higher end of the scale, but not at the extreme.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Cynthia mentions her love for books, music, and spending time on her porch reading, which suggests she engages with imaginative or creative activities. She also reflects on her past and future with a thoughtful, introspective mindset, which aligns with someone who uses imagination to process and envision her life. While she isn't overtly artistic or expressive, her introspection and engagement with literature and music indicate a moderate to active imagination."

            "REI_1": "Cynthia describes herself as someone who takes time to reflect, makes thoughtful decisions, and values small, consistent steps. She mentions feeling uncertain about her future and not having all the answers yet, which suggests she may not feel confident in her ability to solve complex problems quickly or decisively. However, she also shows a sense of responsibility and determination, which might push her toward a middle ground rather than a strong agreement.",
            "REI_2": "Cynthia describes herself as thoughtful and reflective, but not overly analytical. She values quiet determination, community, and small steps toward growth. While she is capable of making thoughtful decisions, she does not emphasize logical analysis as a strength. Her responses suggest she relies more on intuition, experience, and emotional intelligence than on structured logical reasoning.",
            "REI_3": "Cynthia describes herself as reflective, thoughtful, and someone who values small steps and personal experiences. She often makes decisions based on intuition, like choosing to take a gap year, and reflects on her life in a narrative, emotional way. She doesn't emphasize logic or structured reasoning in her decision-making, which suggests she may lean toward the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_4": "Cynthia demonstrates careful reasoning throughout the interview. She reflects on her life choices, weighs options thoughtfully (e.g., taking a gap year to work and save), and considers the impact of her decisions on her family and future. She also shows introspection about her health, financial situation, and emotional well-being, indicating she does reason things out carefully.",
            "REI_5": "Cynthia describes herself as someone who takes time to reflect, values thoughtful decisions, and often feels the weight of uncertainty in her life. She also mentions feeling stuck in cycles and struggling with anxiety, which suggests she may not perform well under pressure. Her tendency to take small, deliberate steps rather than rushing into decisions supports the idea that she may not reason well under pressure.",
            "REI_6": "Cynthia describes herself as someone who makes decisions thoughtfully but not through grand epiphanies — rather, through quiet clarity and small steps. She reflects on her choices as being guided by responsibility and patience, rather than a strong emphasis on logical analysis. She also acknowledges uncertainty and the value of taking time to figure things out, which suggests she does not strongly identify with being particularly logical or analytical.",
            "REI_7": "Cynthia describes herself as thoughtful and reflective, but she also emphasizes her introspective nature, emotional connections to her family and community, and her tendency to make decisions based on personal values and small, consistent steps. While she is capable of thoughtful planning, she does not emphasize logical reasoning as a defining trait. Instead, she seems more guided by intuition, emotional support, and personal experience.",
            "REI_8": "Cynthia often reflects on her decisions, such as taking a gap year after high school, and describes her choices as thoughtful and deliberate. She also mentions that she doesn't rush into things and values patience and small steps. This suggests she is comfortable with careful thinking and aligns with the higher end of the range.",
            "REI_9": "Cynthia often reflects on her decisions as being thoughtful but not necessarily driven by strict logic. She describes her choices as quiet, deliberate, and rooted in values like family and community, rather than purely analytical reasoning. She also acknowledges uncertainty and the importance of small steps, which suggests a more intuitive or reflective approach to problem-solving rather than a strictly logical one.",
            "REI_10": "Cynthia often reflects on her decisions, such as choosing to take a gap year, working part-time, and enrolling in community college. She describes her choices as thoughtful and deliberate, even if they are not dramatic or grand. She also mentions that her decisions are influenced by her family, her values, and her desire to build a stable future. This suggests she has clear, explainable reasons for her decisions, even if they are not always immediate or obvious."
