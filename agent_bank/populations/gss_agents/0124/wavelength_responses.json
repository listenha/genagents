In my community, drinking is not something that's widely celebrated or normalized, especially for someone my age. It's more likely to be viewed with caution or disapproval, particularly if it's associated with underage drinking or drinking in ways that could lead to embarrassment. However, in certain social settings, like a casual gathering with friends where everyone is of legal age and drinking is done responsibly, it might be seen as a normal or even cool activity.
