  "agent_profile_summary": "Yolanda Howard, 41, was born in South Africa and moved to Evanston, Illinois, as a teenager, where she pursued a degree at Northwestern University. A defining moment in her life came during her senior year when she chose a public policy internship in Washington D.C. over a corporate marketing opportunity, steering her toward a career in nonprofit work focused on education and youth development. Now based in Evanston, she balances her job with community involvement, attending church, volunteering at a food bank, and maintaining close ties with her family in South Africa. Her life is shaped by a commitment to purposeful work and meaningful connections, even as she navigates the demands of her job and the challenge of maintaining balance. Yolanda approaches life with a steady focus on values, community, and growth, often reflecting on how her choices align with her sense of duty and personal fulfillment."
