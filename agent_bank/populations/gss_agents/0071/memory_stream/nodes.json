Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nYolanda Howard: Sure, let's start from the beginning. I was born and raised in South Africa, in a small town in the Eastern Cape. My parents were both educators, though they only had high school diplomas. They instilled in me a strong sense of values and hard work from a young age. Even though we lived modestly, my parents always managed to find ways to enrich our lives culturally and spiritually. My family structure remained intact until I was 16, when my parents moved us to Evanston, Illinois, where I attended Northwestern University. I found the transition quite challenging, but it also opened up new opportunities for me.\n\n",

What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nYolanda Howard: There was a pivotal moment during my senior year at Northwestern. I had been offered two internships, one in marketing and another in public policy. Both were excellent opportunities, but they led very different paths. The marketing internship was in a bustling city, promising fast-paced growth and a chance to build my skills in corporate settings. The public policy internship was in Washington D.C., focusing on social justice and advocacy. After much deliberation, I chose the public policy path. It wasn't just about the work; it was about aligning my values with my career. That decision led me to a fulfilling career in nonprofit work, where I can make a tangible impact on communities.\n\n",

Rent is the biggest expense, followed by groceries and transportation. I try to keep my spending on non-essentials to a minimum, so I allocate money for hobbies like painting and gardening. Health insurance is also a significant monthly cost, but thankfully, my employer offers a good plan. Last month, I spent a bit more on groceries because I started cooking more meals at home instead of eating out, which has helped me save some money in the long run.\n\n",

I try to stick to a strict budget for groceries and utilities, and I've been trying to reduce dining out to save more.
