They often have their own way of showing affection, which may not be as direct as dogs, but it is still present.

They existed long before human civilization and their extinction was a significant, albeit random, event in the history of life. This aligns more with the idea that history is random, as their existence and extinction were not part of a linear path toward human progress. However, they are also part of a broader evolutionary narrative, which could imply some form of progression. Given the randomness of their extinction and the lack of direct connection to civilization, I lean more toward the 'history is random' side."

However, when it's done in a way that feels forced, excessive, or tied to social pressure, it can definitely feel cringe. My own perspective is shaped by the mindfulness and balance I value, so I see drinking as something that can be neutral or even positive when approached with awareness, but it's not inherently cool or cringe."

While it could hint at a longing for home (homesickness), it also carries a subtle beauty and calm that might align with a sense of wonder or curiosity about a new environment. Given my own experiences of moving from Vienna to Portland, and my appreciation for both the comfort of home and the beauty of new places, I see this clue as leaning more toward wanderlust than homesickness.
