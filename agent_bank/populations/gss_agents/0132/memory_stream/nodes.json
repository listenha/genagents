Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nElizabeth Buchanan: I was born in Vienna, Austria, to a family that valued education and culture deeply. My father was a professor of philosophy, and my mother was a translator. We moved to the United States when I was nine, settling in Portland, Oregon, where I grew up. Life wasn't easy at first\u2014we had to adjust to a new language, new customs, and a different way of life. My parents worked hard to give me and my younger brother a good education, and I was always encouraged to pursue my interests. I was fascinated by languages and Eastern philosophies from a young age, which is why I eventually converted to Buddhism in my early twenties. I went to college in Oregon, studied comparative religion, and later earned my graduate degree in cultural studies. After college, I married my husband, David, who is a software developer. We have two children, and I've chosen to stay home with them while also volunteering at a local community center. It's been a different kind of work, but I find purpose in it. Looking back, my journey has been one of adaptation, growth, and finding balance between my roots and the life I've built here.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nElizabeth Buchanan: Yes, there was a moment that felt like a crossroads, though I didn't realize it at the time. I was around twenty-two, finishing my undergraduate degree in comparative religion. I had been raised in a very structured, academic environment, and I had always been expected to follow a traditional path\u2014perhaps becoming a professor or a researcher. But I was also deeply drawn to the spiritual and philosophical aspects of Buddhism, which I had studied on my own for years. I had the opportunity to take a semester abroad in Kyoto, Japan, to study at a Buddhist monastery. It was a chance to immerse myself in the practice, to live simply, and to reflect on my purpose. My parents were hesitant\u2014they worried about the stability of such a path, and I was worried about leaving my brother behind, who was still in high school. But I went. That semester changed everything. I returned with a clearer sense of who I was and what I wanted. I didn't go back to the academic path I had been on. Instead, I pursued a graduate degree in cultural studies, focusing on the intersection of Eastern philosophies and Western societies. That decision led me to meet my husband, who was working on a tech project that involved cultural adaptation in global software design. I think that crossroads was the moment I truly began to define my own path, rather than following someone else's expectations.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nElizabeth Buchanan: I think it was a conscious choice, but not in the way most people might expect. I wasn't making a decision in a moment of clarity or certainty\u2014I was making a decision in the midst of uncertainty. I had spent so much of my life following expectations, whether my parents', my culture's, or even my own academic ambitions. But when I was in Kyoto, I realized that I didn't want to be someone who just studied these things from a distance. I wanted to live them. So I made the choice to shift my focus, even though I didn't know exactly where it would take me. I think that's what makes it so meaningful to me\u2014it wasn't a sudden revelation, but a slow, deliberate turning away from one path and toward another, even when the new path wasn't fully visible yet.\n\n",

My parents were supportive in their own way, but they were also deeply rooted in their own expectations for me. I remember talking to a professor of mine, Dr. Langston, who had a way of asking questions that made you look at your own assumptions. He once asked me, 'What would you do if you weren't afraid of being wrong?' That question stuck with me. I think if I had been more open to guidance like that, or if I had found a mentor who understood the spiritual path as deeply as I did, it might have made the transition easier. But in the end, I think I needed to go through that uncertainty on my own. It was a lonely path, but it was mine.\n\n",

We met through a mutual friend during my graduate studies\u2014actually, he was working on a project that involved designing user interfaces for cultural institutions, and I was assisting with the research side of it. We connected over our shared interest in how different cultures interact with technology. We married a few years after I finished my degree, and we have two children: a daughter, Clara, who's seven, and a son, Liam, who's four. I chose to stay home with them full-time, which has been both challenging and deeply fulfilling. I also volunteer at a local community center, where I help organize cultural exchange programs\u2014something that ties back to my roots and my studies. It's a way for me to give back, to help others find the same kind of connection and understanding that I did when I was younger.\n\n",

The crossroads I faced in Kyoto was a pivotal moment, not just in terms of my career, but in how I began to define my own values and purpose. I realize now that even the uncertainty I felt back then was part of the process of growing into the person I am. It's also humbling to think about how much my parents and professors influenced me, even when I didn't fully recognize their impact at the time. Now, as I raise my children and volunteer in the community, I feel a deep connection to the lessons I've learned throughout my life.

One of them is Aiko, a fellow student from my time in Kyoto. She was the one who encouraged me to stay for the full semester and really helped me navigate the cultural and spiritual aspects of life there. We remained in touch, and even though we live on opposite sides of the world now, she's someone I can always count on for deep conversations and support. Then there's my friend Rachel, who I met during my graduate studies here in Portland. She's a social worker, and she's been a huge influence on my decision to volunteer at the community center. She's the one who first introduced me to the idea of cultural exchange programs, and she's always pushing me to think about how I can use my background to help others.

It's a mix of older homes and some newer developments, with a lot of trees and green spaces. There's a community garden nearby where I sometimes volunteer, and it's become a little hub for people to gather, share food, and talk about things that matter. The area has a diverse population\u2014there are a lot of artists, teachers, and professionals who have chosen to live here because of the sense of community.

One of the things I appreciate most is the sense of timelessness\u2014the older homes have a character that feels rooted in history, and the community feels like it's been built with care. That said, there are moments when I feel the weight of the slower pace. As someone who once lived in a fast-paced academic environment and later in the tech world through my husband's work, I sometimes miss the energy of a more dynamic setting. But I've come to realize that the slower rhythm here allows me to be more present with my children, to notice the small things\u2014the way the light filters through the trees in the morning, or how the community garden has become a place where people from different backgrounds come together. It's not without its struggles\u2014like any neighborhood, there are issues with affordability and gentrification that I watch with concern.

She walks to school with a friend, which I think helps her feel more connected to her peers. Liam, who's in preschool, has a slightly more flexible schedule, but we try to get him up and out by 8:30.

About a year ago, I started experiencing more frequent migraines, which I hadn't dealt with in a long time. At first, I thought it was stress-related, and it was, but it turned out that I had developed a mild case of sinusitis that was contributing to the pain. I worked with a naturopath and made some changes to my diet and sleep habits, which helped manage it. Around the same time, I also had a minor flare-up of the back issues I've had since my graduate studies. I was doing a lot of bending and lifting with the kids, and one day I felt a sharp pain in my lower back. I saw my chiropractor, and with some adjustments and physical therapy, I was able to get back on track. These experiences made me more aware of how interconnected my physical health is with my emotional and spiritual well-being. I've since made a point to schedule regular check-ups and to take more time for rest, even if it means saying no to things that don't align with my health priorities.

There were days when the migraines left me feeling drained, and I had to cancel plans or take a step back from certain responsibilities. The back pain, too, made some tasks more challenging, like bending down to help the kids with their homework or carrying groceries. But what I've learned is that these moments aren't setbacks\u2014they're reminders to slow down and reassess. I've had to become more intentional about pacing myself, asking for help when I need it, and not trying to do everything at once. It's not always easy, but I've come to see that taking care of my health isn't just about avoiding problems\u2014it's about creating space to be fully present for my family and the work I do. In that way, it's actually strengthened my ability to care for my children and contribute to the community, because I'm more aware now of what my body and mind need to function at their best.\n\n",

There have been challenges, of course\u2014health issues, the ongoing demands of raising two young children, and the ever-present tension between wanting to contribute to the community and needing to rest. But there's also been a quiet strength that has grown within me, a kind of resilience that comes from learning to listen to myself more deeply. I've found comfort in the routines I've built, like the morning meditations with the kids or the Sunday family meals, and I've come to see these as acts of love and care, not just habits. I've also felt a renewed sense of purpose in my work at the community center, especially as I've started to see the impact of the cultural exchange programs we've organized. It's humbling to realize how much I've grown over the past year\u2014not just as a mother or a volunteer, but as someone who is more in tune with her own needs and values.

There were periods when I questioned whether I was doing enough, whether I was being the kind of mother, wife, and community member I wanted to be. But I've come to see those feelings not as weaknesses, but as signs that I care deeply about the people and values in my life. I've started to approach anxiety with more compassion, using mindfulness and meditation to ground myself when I feel overwhelmed.

He's taken on more responsibilities at home, whether it's helping with the kids' homework, cooking dinners, or even joining me at the community center for events. It's been a beautiful reminder of how partnership can look in everyday life\u2014not just in grand gestures, but in the small, consistent ways we show up for each other. Clara and Liam have also been growing in ways that are both heartwarming and humbling. Clara is becoming more independent, more curious about the world, and more aware of the values we're trying to instill in her. Liam, though still young, has a way of reminding me of the importance of presence\u2014how he can be so completely engaged in the moment, whether it's building a tower with blocks or watching the clouds pass by.

How about you?\n\nElizabeth Buchanan: Spirituality has been a cornerstone of my life, shaping not just my beliefs but the way I move through the world. When I was younger, I was raised in a very academic, almost rigid environment, where religion was more of a cultural backdrop than a lived experience. But when I was in Kyoto, studying at the monastery, I felt something shift inside me. It wasn't just about the rituals or the teachings\u2014it was about the way of being, the quiet presence, the deep respect for all things. That's when I truly began to understand what Buddhism meant to me. It's not about escaping life's difficulties, but about embracing them with awareness and compassion. Now, as a mother, I see how that practice has influenced the way I parent, how I approach challenges, and how I try to model mindfulness for my children. I don't always get it right, but I believe that spirituality is about showing up, even when it's hard, and finding meaning in the ordinary. It's a path I continue to walk, not because I have all the answers, but because it helps me stay grounded in the midst of life's constant change.\n\n",

For me, it's more about staying connected with specific people in meaningful ways. I have a small group of friends and family who I keep in touch with through occasional messages or video calls, especially my parents in Vienna and Aiko from Kyoto.

I think part of that comes from the mindfulness practices I've integrated into my daily life, especially the breathing exercises I do with the kids in the mornings. It's taught me to pause, even for just a moment, before reacting to stress. I've also become more aware of how my emotional state is tied to my physical health, so when I take care of my body\u2014through rest, movement, and nourishing food\u2014it has a ripple effect on my mind. I've started journaling more, not just for reflection, but as a way to release things I might otherwise hold onto. And I've learned to ask for help more openly, whether it's from David, Rachel, or even the other volunteers at the community center. It's not that I don't still feel stress or worry\u2014it's just that I now have tools to navigate it, and I'm more willing to lean on others when I need to.

David and I have a modest income, mostly from his job as a software developer, and I don't earn a traditional salary, so we have to be careful with every dollar. The cost of childcare is the largest single expense\u2014Liam is in a daycare that's not cheap, and Clara has after-school activities that add up. Groceries are another big one, especially since I try to cook meals with fresh, whole ingredients, which can be more expensive than processed foods. We also had to replace the water heater, which came out of our savings. It's not always easy, but we've learned to live within our means, prioritize what's essential, and find creative ways to stretch our budget. For example, we carpool with other parents to save on gas, and I've started growing some of our own herbs in the small garden behind our house.

Typically, we average between $2,800 and $3,000 per month. The increase was mainly due to the unexpected water heater repair, which cost about $600, and a few additional expenses related to Clara's after-school activities. Normally, our biggest expenses are childcare, groceries, and utilities. David's salary covers most of our needs, but we also rely on some savings and the occasional community assistance program for things like school supplies or cultural events.

Renting has been a good choice for us, especially since we're still figuring out our long-term plans.

Tell me all about how your bills have fluctuated over the past year.\n\nElizabeth Buchanan: Over the past year, our bills have had their usual ups and downs, depending on the season and what's going on with the kids. In the winter, our heating bill tends to go up, and we've had to be more careful with our energy use, especially since we're trying to keep our carbon footprint low. In the summer, we use more electricity for the air conditioner, but we've also started using fans and natural ventilation to cut costs. School-related expenses also fluctuate\u2014when the kids are in session, we have more costs for after-school activities, school supplies, and transportation. Then there are the holidays, which bring their own set of expenses, like gifts, special meals, and sometimes even travel. Last Christmas, for example, we had a small family trip to visit my parents in Vienna, which added a few hundred dollars to our budget. On the flip side, there are months where things are quieter\u2014like in the summer when the kids are on break, and we don't have as many scheduled activities.

But it's not just about the practical tasks\u2014it's about creating a nurturing environment where my children can grow, learn, and feel loved. At the community center, I help organize cultural exchange programs, teach language classes, and facilitate discussions on topics like mindfulness and intercultural understanding.

While David's work as a software developer is his primary source of income, I've taken on a few side projects that align with my interests in cultural exchange and mindfulness. For example, I occasionally lead small meditation workshops for local parents and teachers, and I've been collaborating with a few neighbors to start a community garden that also serves as a space for intercultural dialogue.

I think of them as part of the same journey\u2014whether I'm teaching a language class, helping a neighbor plant herbs, or simply being present for my children, it all feels like work that matters. It's not about the hours or the paycheck, but about the impact, however small, that I can have on the people and community around me.\n\n",

Talking about my stress, coping strategies, and how I manage my household has reminded me of the importance of balance\u2014not just in my daily routines, but in how I approach challenges with both my mind and my heart. I've come to see that emotional resilience is not something I have to achieve alone; it's something that grows through the love and presence of my family, the kindness of my friends, and the small, intentional choices I make every day. At the same time, managing our household budget and expenses has shown me how much I value simplicity and intentionality in life. It's not about having more, but about being mindful of what truly matters\u2014our health, our time together, and the ways we can contribute to each other and our community. These reflections have deepened my gratitude for the life I have, even in its imperfections, and have reminded me that I am not just surviving, but learning to thrive in the way that feels most authentic to me.",

It's not a huge amount, but it's enough to cover our basic needs and some of the things that matter most to us\u2014like cultural experiences, family time, and keeping our home comfortable. I think of it as a kind of quiet abundance, not because we have more than we need, but because we've learned to value what we have and make it work for us. It's not always easy, but I feel grateful for the stability we've built, even if it's not the kind of wealth that's measured in numbers alone.\n\n",

I've been in this role\u2014of homemaker, volunteer, and cultural educator\u2014for nearly seven years now, since we moved here to Irvington and I started volunteering at the center. The benefits of this work aren't the kind you find on a company brochure, but they are real and deeply meaningful. I get to spend time with my children every day, which is the greatest gift I can imagine. I also get to connect with others in the community, to share ideas, and to create spaces where people can learn from one another. There's no paid vacation or sick leave in the traditional sense, but I do have the freedom to rest when I need to, to slow down, and to be present in the way that truly matters. I think of the benefits as being more about time, connection, and purpose\u2014things that can't always be measured in dollars or hours, but that shape the kind of life I want to live for my family and my community.\n\n",

I don't have a manager in the traditional sense, but there's a small group of people who lead the center, and I work closely with them on planning events and programs. I have a lot of trust and admiration for them\u2014they're passionate about what they do, and they've been incredibly supportive of my ideas, especially when it comes to cultural exchange and mindfulness. As for my coworkers, they're like family. We've been through a lot together\u2014late nights organizing events, long days in the garden, and the occasional moment of frustration when things don't go as planned. But what keeps us going is the shared belief that what we do matters. I feel seen and valued here, not just for what I contribute, but for who I am. It's a different kind of relationship than I had in more traditional workplaces, but it's one that feels more authentic, more connected to the heart of what I want to do in life.\n\n",

Unlike traditional jobs with set hours and strict deadlines, my days are shaped by the needs of my family and the rhythms of the community center. Some weeks I might be more involved with events and programs, which can mean longer hours on certain days, while other weeks are quieter, allowing me more time to rest or focus on personal practice. I also have the freedom to adjust my schedule as needed\u2014whether it's staying late at the center to finish a project or leaving early if I need to be home for the kids. That flexibility is both a gift and a responsibility. It means I have to be intentional about how I use my time, but it also allows me to be present in the ways that matter most.

I've learned to appreciate what we have, to find joy in the simple things, and to be present for the people who matter most. There are moments when I worry about the future, especially with the rising costs of living and the unpredictable nature of life with two young children. But I've also come to see that financial stability isn't just about numbers\u2014it's about the freedom to choose how we live, to prioritize what's important, and to build a life that feels meaningful.

My mother, on the other hand, worked as a translator, which was more flexible but also less predictable. She often had to take on multiple projects at once, which meant her income could fluctuate.

What I noticed growing up was that their work wasn't just about earning a living\u2014it was also about their passion. My father loved teaching, and my mother found deep satisfaction in the way language could connect people.

Their most important activities were deeply tied to their passions. My father's duties involved teaching, writing, and engaging in philosophical debates\u2014both in the classroom and in the broader academic community. He had a way of making complex ideas accessible, and I remember how he would come home from work and sit with us, discussing everything from ancient Greek thought to modern existentialism. My mother, on the other hand, spent her days translating texts between languages, often working on projects that bridged cultures. She had a particular love for translating religious and literary works, and I think that's where my own interest in language and spirituality began. What I admired most about both of them was how they approached their work not just as a means of survival, but as a way of contributing to the world in a meaningful way. They taught me that even the most intellectual or quiet forms of work can have a deep impact, and that's something I carry with me in everything I do today.\n\n",

Their work wasn't about making a lot of money\u2014it was about contributing to something larger than themselves. My father taught philosophy, which meant he spent a lot of time in lectures, writing papers, and engaging with students and colleagues in deep discussions. He also published books and articles, which was both a professional duty and a personal passion. My mother, on the other hand, worked with texts\u2014translating everything from historical documents to literary works. She had a way of making language feel alive, and I remember her talking about how each word carried a kind of weight, a history, and a meaning that couldn't always be captured directly. She often worked from home, which gave her a lot of flexibility, but also meant she had to be disciplined to meet deadlines. What I learned from both of them was that work doesn't have to be about prestige or salary\u2014it can be about purpose, about the way you show up for the world, and about the quiet, steady impact you have on others, even if it's not always seen or celebrated.\n\n",
