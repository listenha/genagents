She works as a high school teacher and participates in committees at her school, indicating an interest in academic and community challenges. Her approach to handling stress through yoga and meditation also suggests she is capable of managing complex situations. Therefore, it is less likely that she would rate herself as 'not good' at solving complicated problems.",

She also mentions that she finds her job rewarding and fulfilling, which suggests she is comfortable with logical analysis and problem-solving. Therefore, it's less likely that she would identify herself as not being good at solving problems that require careful logical analysis.",
            "REI_3": "Based on the interview, Molly appears to have a balanced approach to life, valuing both personal connections and professional responsibilities. While she mentions being a teacher, which involves analytical thinking, she also emphasizes the importance of community and personal connections. This suggests she might not strongly identify as an analytical thinker but also isn't likely to completely dismiss analytical thinking. Therefore, a moderate score of 3 seems fitting, but since the range only goes from 1 to 5, a 3 is closest to the middle and slightly favoring the non-analytical side.",

She mentions that she leans on her partner and friends for support during stressful times, indicating a preference for less deliberative decision-making processes.

She mentions that she tries to manage her stress with yoga and meditation, and she talks about how she recognizes when she needs a break and reaches out for support.

Therefore, it's less likely she would choose the lower end of the scale.",
            "REI_6": "Based on Molly's responses, she appears to be a thoughtful and reflective person who values education and is deeply involved in her community. However, she doesn't explicitly mention being exceptionally good at logical thinking. Given her detailed descriptions of her experiences and her balanced approach to life, it suggests she is competent but not overly confident in her logical abilities compared to most people. Therefore, she is more likely to choose a moderate score.",
            "REI_7": "Based on the information provided in the interview, Molly describes herself as someone who enjoys exploring new places, engaging in outdoor activities, and valuing her relationships and community. While she mentions her love for education and her role as a teacher, which involves some logical thinking, her emphasis on personal connections and the value she places on her faith and family suggests she may not prioritize logical thinking over other aspects of her life. However, given her role as a teacher, which does involve logical reasoning, and her ability to plan and organize her life (e.g., planning a trip to Ireland), she is likely to lean towards the middle of the scale.",

Additionally, she values her faith and family, suggesting she considers various aspects when making decisions. This indicates she is not purely logical but uses a combination of methods.
