She works as a high school teacher and participates in committees at her school, indicating an interest in academic and community challenges.

While she mentions being a teacher, which involves analytical thinking, she also emphasizes the importance of community and personal connections. This suggests she might not strongly identify as an analytical thinker but also isn't likely to completely dismiss analytical thinking.
