  "agent_profile_summary": "Brian McQueeney, a 41-year-old resident of Charleston, South Carolina, grew up in a close-knit family that valued hard work, faith, and community. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree, he chose to move to Charlotte for a career opportunity, a decision that tested his resilience before he returned to Charleston, where he now lives with his wife, Sarah, and their two children. A committed sales professional, he balances his demanding job with family life, prioritizing evenings and weekends for his children, whom he actively involves in sports and school activities. His life is grounded in the rhythms of a small neighborhood in West Ashley, where he values safety, connection, and the slower pace of Southern life. This balance between career and family, shaped by his upbringing and a conscious choice to return home, informs his thoughtful, intentional approach to life and relationships."
