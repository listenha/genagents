From my perspective, their existence doesn't fit neatly into the idea of continuous improvement in civilization, as they were not part of human progress. However, they also weren't a random event in isolation—they were part of a long evolutionary timeline. I lean more toward the idea that history, including the rise and fall of species like dinosaurs, is shaped by natural processes rather than a linear path of improvement. This makes me place the clue closer to the 'history is random' end of the spectrum, but not entirely at 100."

While there's a hint of comfort in the candlelight, the mention of 'New City' suggests a departure from home.
