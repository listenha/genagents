Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nLauren Kallas: I was born and raised in Chicago, in a neighborhood that was pretty diverse even back then. My parents were both working-class, and they divorced when I was pretty young, so I grew up in a single-parent household with my mom. She worked full-time as a receptionist, and she always made sure I had what I needed, even if we weren't rolling in money. I remember being a pretty quiet kid, more interested in books than in playing outside. I was raised Catholic, but I haven't been religious since I was in high school. I always felt like I didn't quite fit in with the more traditional parts of the church, and I guess that's when I started questioning a lot of things. I went to college on a scholarship, eventually earning a graduate degree in social work. It wasn't easy\u2014I worked part-time through most of it, and I had to take out a lot of loans. But I wanted to help people, especially those who had it harder than I did. I've been working full-time now for a few years, and while I'm not where I want to be financially, I feel like I'm on the right path.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nLauren Kallas: There was definitely a crossroads, and it came during my junior year of college. I was working part-time at a community center, helping out with after-school programs for kids from low-income families. One of the kids, a boy named Marcus, had a really tough home life\u2014his mom was struggling with addiction, and he was bouncing between foster homes. I got really close to him, and I remember one day he just looked at me and said, 'You're the only one who ever really listens to me.' That hit me hard. I had always thought I was doing this to help people, but that moment made me realize how much of an impact even small acts of kindness and presence could have. Around the same time, I was offered a job at a nonprofit that paid better but didn't align with my passion for direct service. I had to choose between stability and staying true to my purpose. I chose the latter. It was scary, and I had to take on more debt, but I knew that if I walked away from that path, I might never forgive myself. That decision shaped who I am today\u2014it reinforced my belief that meaningful work is worth the struggle, even when the road is hard.\n\n",

What about you?\n\nLauren Kallas: I think it was a conscious choice, but not in the way most people might expect. I didn't sit down and make a list of pros and cons like I've seen in movies or books. It was more like a quiet realization that I couldn't walk away from the kind of work that made me feel alive, even if it meant sacrificing comfort. I remember lying awake at night, thinking about Marcus and the other kids I worked with, and I kept coming back to the same question: 'What kind of person do I want to be?' I didn't want to be someone who chose the easy path just because it was safer. I wanted to be someone who showed up, even when it was hard. So I made the choice\u2014not because I had all the answers, but because I knew I couldn't live with myself if I didn't.\n\n",

I remember talking to a professor of mine, Dr. Alvarez, who had been through similar struggles. She didn't just teach me about social work theory\u2014she lived it. She took me under her wing and encouraged me to keep going, even when I felt like I was barely keeping my head above water. She also connected me with a mentorship program at the local community center, which gave me the confidence to stick with my path. And then there was the support from the kids I worked with. They reminded me why I was doing this in the first place. Without those people\u2014without that network of support\u2014I don't know if I would have had the strength to make the choice I did. It's funny, though, because I think a lot of people underestimate how much a single person can impact another's life. Sometimes, all it takes is someone who believes in you when you can't believe in yourself.\n\n",

My mom is the most important person in it\u2014she's been my rock through everything. Even though we didn't have a lot growing up, she always made sure I felt loved and supported. We don't talk about the harder parts of our past much, but I know she's proud of me for the work I do. I also have a few cousins who live in the area, and we keep in touch. They're all in different stages of life\u2014some are still in school, others are working, but we always make time for each other during holidays or big events. I think family, for me, is about showing up, even when life gets complicated.

I didn't get to know him very well\u2014he wasn't around much, and when he was, it was more about duty than connection. I remember my mom trying to explain it to me, but I was too young to grasp the full weight of it.

That's why I've always tried to be present for the people in my life, especially the kids I work with. I want them to know that someone is there for them, no matter what.

It's a tight-knit community, but it's also one of the areas that's seen a lot of change over the years. There are still a lot of long-time residents, but there's also a growing population of young professionals and artists moving in, which has brought some new energy to the area. I live in a small apartment above a local bookstore, which is actually owned by an old friend of mine from college. It's a quiet place, and I like that\u2014it gives me a sense of stability. The neighborhood isn't perfect, though. There are still issues with crime and economic disparity, which is why I feel so strongly about the work I do.

I work full-time at a nonprofit that supports at-risk youth, so my days are pretty much the same\u2014meetings, case reviews, and sometimes direct work with kids or their families.

When I take care of myself, I show up more fully for them. But what makes it hard is the constant pressure to do more, to be more, even when I'm already stretched thin.

The biggest thing was a flare-up of the chronic migraines I started getting a few years ago. They used to come once in a while, but they've become more frequent and intense, especially during stressful periods at work. I remember one particularly bad week where I had three migraines in a row, and I had to take a few days off just to recover. It was frustrating because I felt like I was letting the kids I work with down, but I realized that if I wasn't well, I couldn't be fully present for them. I also started seeing a therapist for the first time, which has been really helpful in managing the stress and emotional weight of my job. It's not something I ever thought I needed before, but I've come to see mental health as just as important as physical health.

When I was dealing with those migraines, I had to cancel a few meetings and even miss a few days at work. It was hard because I felt like I was failing the kids I was trying to help. But what I've come to realize is that showing up for them doesn't mean being perfect\u2014it means being present, even if that means taking a step back sometimes. I've also had to adjust how I manage my time and energy, which has been a learning process. I used to think I had to be strong all the time, but now I see that strength also comes from knowing when to ask for help. I've started setting clearer boundaries at work, and I've learned to say no to things that don't align with my well-being.

The work I do is deeply meaningful, but it also takes a toll. I've been trying to be more intentional about how I care for myself, which has helped, but there are still moments when I feel overwhelmed by the weight of it all.

I've started to let go of some of the guilt I used to feel when I had to take a step back or say no to something. That's been hard, but it's also been healing.

For a long time, I thought it was just part of the job\u2014being hyper-aware of the challenges people face, the weight of responsibility, the pressure to do more with less. But over the past year, I've started to see it for what it is: a constant undercurrent of worry that I can't always shake. It shows up in little ways\u2014tightness in my chest when I'm overwhelmed, trouble sleeping even when I'm not working late, or feeling like I'm constantly on edge, even when I'm sitting still. I used to push through it, thinking I had to be strong for the kids I work with, but I've come to realize that acknowledging my own struggles doesn't make me any less capable. In fact, it makes me more human. I've started seeing a therapist, and it's been a slow but important process of learning how to sit with my thoughts instead of running from them.

I don't follow a lot of accounts, and when I do, it's usually ones that share stories about community work or mental health, because those are the things that resonate with me.

But I've never posted about my struggles publicly or sought out emotional support through those platforms. I prefer to talk things out face-to-face, even if it's just a phone call.

Groceries are another thing\u2014since I try to eat well and cook at least one meal from scratch each week, that adds up, especially when I'm buying fresh produce and whole foods.

My schedule is pretty consistent\u2014Monday through Friday, starting at 8:30 a.m. and ending around 5 p.m., but I often stay late when I need to wrap up a project or meet with a client. The work is demanding, and I've learned to pace myself, but there are days when I feel like I'm running on fumes. Still, I keep going because I know how much it means to the kids I work with. I remember Marcus, the boy I told you about earlier\u2014he's now in college, and he sends me updates every once in a while. Reading those messages is what keeps me going, even on the hardest days.\n\n",

I've been fully committed to my work at Bright Futures Chicago, and while I used to take on part-time gigs in college to help make ends meet, I've found that focusing on one role allows me to be more present for the kids and families I serve. There were a few times when I considered freelancing or taking on extra shifts at the bookstore where I live, but I always ended up saying no. I think it's because I know how much this work demands\u2014not just in terms of time, but also emotionally. I don't want to spread myself too thin, especially when I know how much it means to be fully there for the people I care about.

Talking about my stress levels and the emotional toll of my work reminded me of how much I've been carrying, not just professionally, but also personally. It's been a journey to learn how to manage that stress\u2014whether through journaling, therapy, or simply taking a moment to breathe. At the same time, discussing my monthly budget and expenses brought up the reality of living on a tight financial margin, which adds another layer of pressure. I've always believed that the work I do is worth it, but it's not without its sacrifices. I've had to make tough choices about where to allocate my money, and sometimes it feels like I'm constantly choosing between paying my bills and investing in myself. But I'm learning that even small steps\u2014like setting aside money for therapy or buying a book\u2014can make a difference. These questions made me feel both vulnerable and grounded, like I was finally giving myself permission to acknowledge the weight I carry without feeling like I have to fix everything all at once. I'm still figuring it out, but I'm starting to see that taking care of my mental health and financial stability isn't just about surviving\u2014it's about living with intention, even when the path isn't easy.",

I try to live within my means, and I've gotten pretty good at tracking my expenses, but there are still days when I feel like I'm constantly choosing between paying my bills and investing in myself.

The benefits package isn't anything extravagant, but it's enough to get by. I have health insurance, which is a huge relief, especially with the migraines and back pain I've been dealing with. I also get a few weeks of paid vacation and sick time each year, which I try to use wisely. I know how easy it is to burn out in this line of work, so I make sure to take those days when I need to, even if it means stepping away from the chaos for a little while.

I have a good relationship with my manager, Ms. Thompson. She's been in the field for a long time, and she knows the weight of this work. She doesn't always have the answers, but she's always willing to listen and offer guidance when I need it. I think she sees me as someone who's committed, even if I don't always have the easiest time with the emotional toll.

We all have different styles, but there's a shared understanding that this job isn't just about the tasks we do; it's about the people we're trying to help. I have a few close coworkers, like Jamal, who I mentioned earlier. He's been a huge support, not just professionally but personally. We've had long conversations about the struggles of this work, and I think that kind of connection is rare in a place like this.

But I also know that this kind of flexibility can be a double-edged sword\u2014when you're always on call, it's hard to truly disconnect. I've had to learn how to set boundaries, even if it's just knowing when to say no to extra work so I can take care of myself.

She had a way of making people feel at ease, even when they were in pain or distress.
