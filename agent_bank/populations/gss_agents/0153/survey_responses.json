She also reflects on how she 'didn't want to be someone who chose the easy path just because it was safer' and how she values being present for others. While she is clearly introspective and thoughtful, she also shows a strong desire to connect with others, especially the kids she works with. However, she does not describe herself as outgoing or expressive in social settings, which suggests a more reserved nature.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Lauren Kallas has shown a deep commitment to her work with at-risk youth, often placing trust in the people she serves and the community she is part of. She describes her relationships with her mother, coworkers, and the kids she works with in a way that suggests she values and trusts these connections. She also reflects on the importance of showing up for others, which implies a level of trust in the people around her.

She describes having to learn how to manage her emotional well-being, set boundaries, and prioritize self-care. While she has made progress in coping strategies, she also admits to days when she feels overwhelmed and emotionally drained. This suggests she does not see herself as someone who handles stress effortlessly, but rather as someone who is still learning and growing in this area.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Lauren mentions a love for reading and describes how she finds solace in books, which is a form of artistic or intellectual engagement. However, she does not mention any other artistic interests like music, painting, or creative writing.

            "BFI-10_6": "Lauren describes herself as someone who values meaningful connections, but she also reflects on her tendency to carry emotional weight and prioritize being present for others over personal needs. She mentions her work with at-risk youth and her focus on deep, one-on-one relationships rather than large social circles. While she is described as being supportive and connected to her community, she also shows signs of introspection and emotional reserve, which suggests she may not identify strongly with being outgoing or sociable in the traditional sense.",

She emphasizes the importance of being present, listening, and ensuring that the kids she works with have access to resources. She also reflects on the emotional and mental weight of her job and the importance of showing up for others. This suggests she is committed to doing her job thoroughly, even if it is emotionally taxing. She also mentions the impact of her decisions and the importance of being fully present, which aligns with someone who sees themselves as thorough.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Lauren has discussed her struggles with anxiety, describing it as a constant undercurrent of worry that she has been working to manage. She acknowledges feeling overwhelmed by the emotional weight of her work and has sought therapy to address it. While she has made progress in learning to cope, she still describes days when anxiety feels like a 'heavy fog.' This suggests she would likely rate herself somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Lauren reflects on her life with a deep sense of introspection and emotional awareness, often drawing on personal experiences and relationships to understand herself and others. While she is grounded and practical in her approach to work and life, she also shows a capacity for reflection, empathy, and imagining the perspectives of others, such as the children she works with. This suggests a moderate to high level of imagination, but not an overtly creative or fantastical one."

She also mentions that she 'didn't want to be someone who chose the easy path just because it was safer' and that she 'showed up, even when it was hard.' These statements suggest that she is thoughtful and introspective, but not necessarily reserved in a negative or shy way. She is engaged in her work and relationships, and she reflects deeply on her choices and emotions. However, she does not seem to be someone who actively seeks attention or thrives in highly social environments.

This suggests she would not rate herself highly on this scale.",

            "REI_5": "Lauren describes her work as emotionally demanding and acknowledges that she sometimes feels overwhelmed, especially when dealing with the challenges faced by the kids she works with. She also mentions struggling with anxiety and the emotional toll of her job, which suggests she may not always reason well under pressure. However, she also shows resilience and a strong sense of purpose, which might help her manage stress. Still, her self-reported experiences of feeling 'running on fumes' and needing to 'slow down' suggest she may lean toward agreeing with the statement.",

She often reflects on her feelings, relationships, and the emotional impact of her work. While she is thoughtful and reflective, she doesn't emphasize logical reasoning or problem-solving as a core part of her identity. Instead, she focuses on empathy, resilience, and community.

            "REI_9": "Lauren describes her decision-making as being guided by emotional and relational factors, such as her connection to Marcus, her commitment to her community, and her values of presence and kindness. While she does show some reflective and thoughtful behavior, her approach to life and work seems more rooted in empathy, intuition, and personal values than in strict logic or analytical reasoning. She often speaks about the emotional weight of her work and the importance of being present, which suggests a more intuitive or values-driven approach to problem-solving.",
            "REI_10": "Lauren reflects deeply on her decisions, especially in moments of personal and professional significance, such as choosing to stay in social work despite financial challenges. She often explains her choices with thoughtful reasoning, such as her decision to prioritize purpose over stability, and she articulates her motivations clearly.

She often references storytelling (e.g., the story of Marcus), her internal reflections, and her ability to connect with others on a meaningful level.

            "REI_6": "Lauren describes her decision-making as more intuitive and emotionally driven, especially when it comes to her career and personal choices. She reflects on moments of decision as being guided by feelings, values, and relationships rather than a calculated, logical process.

She also talks about her emotional struggles and how she has learned to be more open about them. This suggests she is not particularly reserved and is more inclined to express herself, even when it's difficult.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Lauren demonstrates a strong sense of connection and commitment to others, particularly in her work with at-risk youth.

She describes having migraines, back pain, and emotional exhaustion, and has had to learn new coping strategies like mindfulness and therapy. While she has made progress in managing her stress, she still feels the weight of her responsibilities and the emotional toll of her work.

She mentions taking time for herself, practicing mindfulness, and having a small, intentional social circle. While she is clearly engaged with others—especially those she works with—she also shows a need for balance and introspection, which suggests she may not identify strongly as outgoing or sociable in the traditional sense.",

She mentions feeling overwhelmed by the emotional toll of her work and has acknowledged that she used to push through anxiety without addressing it. This suggests she is more likely to identify with the higher end of the scale, as she has described feeling on edge and emotionally drained, even when not actively working.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Lauren Kallas reflects on her life with a strong sense of purpose, community, and emotional depth. She often references her experiences with children, her work in social services, and her personal growth.
