She also reflects on how she 'didn't want to be someone who chose the easy path just because it was safer' and how she values being present for others. While she is clearly introspective and thoughtful, she also shows a strong desire to connect with others, especially the kids she works with. However, she does not describe herself as outgoing or expressive in social settings, which suggests a more reserved nature.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Lauren Kallas has shown a deep commitment to her work with at-risk youth, often placing trust in the people she serves and the community she is part of. She describes her relationships with her mother, coworkers, and the kids she works with in a way that suggests she values and trusts these connections. She also reflects on the importance of showing up for others, which implies a level of trust in the people around her.

She describes having to learn how to manage her emotional well-being, set boundaries, and prioritize self-care. While she has made progress in coping strategies, she also admits to days when she feels overwhelmed and emotionally drained. This suggests she does not see herself as someone who handles stress effortlessly, but rather as someone who is still learning and growing in this area.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Lauren mentions a love for reading and describes how she finds solace in books, which is a form of artistic or intellectual engagement. However, she does not mention any other artistic interests like music, painting, or creative writing.

            "BFI-10_6": "Lauren describes herself as someone who values meaningful connections, but she also reflects on her tendency to carry emotional weight and prioritize being present for others over personal needs. She mentions her work with at-risk youth and her focus on deep, one-on-one relationships rather than large social circles. While she is described as being supportive and connected to her community, she also shows signs of introspection and emotional reserve, which suggests she may not identify strongly with being outgoing or sociable in the traditional sense.",

She emphasizes the importance of being present, listening, and ensuring that the kids she works with have access to resources. She also reflects on the emotional and mental weight of her job and the importance of showing up for others. This suggests she is committed to doing her job thoroughly, even if it is emotionally taxing. She also mentions the impact of her decisions and the importance of being fully present, which aligns with someone who sees themselves as thorough.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Lauren has discussed her struggles with anxiety, describing it as a constant undercurrent of worry that she has been working to manage. She acknowledges feeling overwhelmed by the emotional weight of her work and has sought therapy to address it. While she has made progress in learning to cope, she still describes days when anxiety feels like a 'heavy fog.' This suggests she would likely rate herself somewhere in the middle to higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Lauren reflects on her life with a deep sense of introspection and emotional awareness, often drawing on personal experiences and relationships to understand herself and others. While she is grounded and practical in her approach to work and life, she also shows a capacity for reflection, empathy, and imagining the perspectives of others, such as the children she works with. This suggests a moderate to high level of imagination, but not an overtly creative or fantastical one."

            "BFI-10_1": "Lauren describes herself as someone who was 'quiet' as a child and 'more interested in books than in playing outside.' She also mentions that she 'didn't want to be someone who chose the easy path just because it was safer' and that she 'showed up, even when it was hard.' These statements suggest that she is thoughtful and introspective, but not necessarily reserved in a negative or shy way. She is engaged in her work and relationships, and she reflects deeply on her choices and emotions. However, she does not seem to be someone who actively seeks attention or thrives in highly social environments. Her personality seems more aligned with being reflective and deliberate rather than outgoing or expressive.",
            "BFI-10_2": "Lauren describes herself as someone who is deeply connected to others, showing up for people even when it's hard. She has a strong sense of empathy and responsibility, especially toward the kids she works with. She also emphasizes the importance of community, relationships, and being present for others, which suggests a general tendency to trust people. While she has faced challenges and emotional strain, she has not expressed a general distrust of others. Instead, she focuses on the positive impact of showing up for people, which aligns with a higher level of trust.",
            "BFI-10_3": "Lauren Kallas describes herself as someone who is deeply committed to her work, often staying late and taking on emotional and physical challenges to support others. She reflects on her dedication, the sacrifices she's made, and the importance of showing up for others. She also acknowledges her own struggles with burnout but frames them as challenges she is actively working to overcome, not as signs of laziness. Her behavior and self-perception are far more aligned with someone who is hardworking and driven.",
            "BFI-10_4": "Lauren has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, migraines, and the emotional toll of her work with at-risk youth. She has described feeling overwhelmed and having to learn how to manage stress through mindfulness, therapy, and setting boundaries. While she has made progress, she still acknowledges that she has days where she feels 'running on fumes' and that stress is a constant part of her life. This suggests she would not rate herself highly on this scale.",
            "BFI-10_5": "Lauren mentions enjoying books and reading, which is a form of artistic or intellectual engagement. However, she does not explicitly mention other artistic interests such as music, visual arts, or creative hobbies. Her focus appears to be more on community service, mental health, and personal reflection rather than artistic expression. This suggests she may not strongly identify with having many artistic interests.",
            "BFI-10_6": "Lauren describes herself as someone who values meaningful connections but also emphasizes her introspective nature, such as her preference for quiet moments, reading, and deep reflection. While she is clearly connected to others—especially her mom, coworkers, and the kids she works with—she does not portray herself as someone who thrives in large social settings or seeks out frequent social interaction. Her work involves deep, one-on-one engagement rather than being the center of attention in groups.",
            "BFI-10_7": "Lauren Kallas demonstrates a strong sense of empathy, compassion, and understanding throughout the interview. She reflects on her own struggles, acknowledges the challenges others face, and consistently emphasizes the importance of being present and supportive for those in need.

            "BFI-10_8": "Lauren Kallas demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and commitment in her work as a case manager. She consistently shows up for the kids she works with, takes on emotional and logistical challenges, and reflects on the importance of being present and thorough in her role. She also mentions the impact of her work and the importance of showing up fully, which aligns with someone who sees themselves as doing a thorough job.",
            "BFI-10_9": "Lauren has openly discussed her struggles with anxiety, particularly in the context of her demanding job and the emotional weight of working with at-risk youth. She described feeling 'constantly on edge' and having 'a constant undercurrent of worry.' These reflections suggest she experiences nervousness or anxiety regularly, aligning more closely with the higher end of the scale.",
            "BFI-10_10": "Lauren Kallas describes herself as someone who found solace in books as a child, and she often reflects on her experiences through storytelling and introspection. She also shows a deep emotional awareness and a tendency to think about the broader implications of her work and life choices, which suggests a rich inner world and imagination. While she is grounded and practical in her approach to life, her reflective nature and emotional depth indicate a strong imaginative capacity."
