!<INPUT 0>!

=====

Task: You are playing a Wavelength-style game. For each game header, a spectrum is defined between two opposites: [LEFT] — [RIGHT]. A clue is given: [CUE]. 

Based on your personality, experiences, and perspective, place a marker on the spectrum (0-100) where you think each clue belongs. 0 means it's completely on the [LEFT] side, 100 means it's completely on the [RIGHT] side.

As you answer, I want you to take the following steps for each game header: 
Step 1) Describe what each end of the spectrum represents for this clue. What would it mean for the clue to be at 0 (completely [LEFT])? What would it mean for it to be at 100 (completely [RIGHT])? ("Range Interpretation")
Step 2) Write a few sentences explaining your reasoning for where you place the marker on this spectrum. Consider your personal experiences, values, and perspective. ("Reasoning")
Step 3) Provide your numerical response (0-100) based on your reasoning. Use your intuitive judgment - don't overthink it. ("Response")

Here are the game headers: 

!<INPUT 1>!

Output format -- output your response in json, where you provide the following: 

{"1": {"Q": "<repeat the game header you are answering>",
       "Range Interpretation": {
            "0 (<LEFT>)": "a few sentences about what it means for the clue to be at 0 (completely on the left side)",
            "100 (<RIGHT>)": "a few sentences about what it means for the clue to be at 100 (completely on the right side)"},
       "Reasoning": "<reasoning on where you place the marker and why>",
       "Response": <a single !<INPUT 2>! value (0-100) that represents where you place the marker on the spectrum>},
 "2": {"Q": "<repeat the game header you are answering>",
       "Range Interpretation": {
            "0 (<LEFT>)": "a few sentences about what it means for the clue to be at 0 (completely on the left side)",
            "100 (<RIGHT>)": "a few sentences about what it means for the clue to be at 100 (completely on the right side)"},
       "Reasoning": "<reasoning on where you place the marker and why>",
       "Response": <your numerical response (0-100) for this game header>},
  ...}
