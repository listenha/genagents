# 📄 Scoring Guide for the Big Five Personality Inventory (BFI-10)

This guide explains the transformation rules necessary to calculate the five core personality scores (Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness) from the 10-item BFI-10 (Rammstedt & John, 2007).

## Step 1: Reverse Scoring 🔄

The BFI-10 uses a 5-point Likert scale:

* **1** = Disagree Strongly
* **2** = Disagree a Little
* **3** = Neither Agree nor Disagree
* **4** = Agree a Little
* **5** = Agree Strongly

To ensure a higher final score always indicates **a higher level of the trait**, items phrased in a negative direction must be **reverse-scored**.

### Items to be Reverse-Scored

Identify the following five items from the BFI-10 (Items 1, 3, 4, 5, 7):

| Item No. | Item Text | Trait |
| :---: | :--- | :---: |
| **1** | is reserved. | Extraversion |
| **3** | tends to be lazy. | Conscientiousness |
| **4** | is relaxed, handles stress well. | Neuroticism |
| **5** | has few artistic interests. | Openness |
| **7** | tends to find fault with others. | Agreeableness |

If a participant's response to one of these five items is $X$, the new score ($X'$) used for calculation is transformed as follows:

| Raw Score ($X$) | New (Reverse) Score ($X'$) |
| :-------------: | :------------------------: |
| 1 | **5** |
| 2 | **4** |
| 3 | **3** |
| 4 | **2** |
| 5 | **1** |

### Items Scored Normally

**The remaining five items** (2, 6, 8, 9, 10) are scored normally. The raw score for these items is used directly in the calculation (Raw Score = Final Score).

## Step 2: Calculation and Interpretation ➕

### Calculation

Each of the five personality dimensions (E, A, C, N, O) is scored by **averaging the two relevant item scores** (using the reverse-scored value $X'$ where needed).

| Trait | Items Used | Formula |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Extraversion (E)** | 1 (Rev.), 6 | $(\text{Item } 1' + \text{Item } 6) / 2$ |
| **Agreeableness (A)** | 2, 7 (Rev.) | $(\text{Item } 2 + \text{Item } 7') / 2$ |
| **Conscientiousness (C)** | 3 (Rev.), 8 | $(\text{Item } 3' + \text{Item } 8) / 2$ |
| **Neuroticism (N)** | 4 (Rev.), 9 | $(\text{Item } 4' + \text{Item } 9) / 2$ |
| **Openness (O)** | 5 (Rev.), 10 | $(\text{Item } 5' + \text{Item } 10) / 2$ |

### Score Range

The final score for each of the five dimensions is a mean, and therefore ranges from **1 to 5**.

### Evaluation

* **Scores closer to 5** indicate a **high level** of that specific trait (e.g., high Extraversion).
* **Scores closer to 1** indicate a **low level** of that specific trait (e.g., low Conscientiousness).
* Scores are typically interpreted by comparing them to **normative data** to understand where an individual falls relative to the general population.
