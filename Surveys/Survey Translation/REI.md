# 📄 Scoring Guide for the Rational-Experiential Inventory (REI) – Rational Ability Subscale

This guide explains the two-step process required to transform raw responses from the 10-item Rational Ability Subscale of the REI (Pacini & Epstein, 1999) into an interpretable total score.

## Step 1: Reverse Scoring 🔄

The subscale uses a 5-point Likert scale where respondents select a score from 1 to 5:

* **1** = Disagree Strongly
* **2** = Disagree a Little
* **3** = Neither
* **4** = Agree a Little
* **5** = Agree Strongly

To ensure a higher final score always indicates **higher self-perceived Rational Ability**, certain items that are phrased to indicate *low* ability must be **reverse-scored**.

### Items to be Reverse-Scored

Identify the following items from the 10-item Rational Ability Subscale:

| Item Number | Item Text |
| :---: | :--- |
| **1** | I'm not that good at figuring out complicated problems. |
| **2** | I am not very good at solving problems that require careful logical analysis. |
| **3** | I am not a very analytical thinker. |
| **4** | Reasoning things out carefully is not one of my strong points. |
| **5** | I don't reason well under pressure. |

If a participant's response to one of these five items is $X$, the new score ($X'$) used for calculation is transformed as follows:

| Raw Score ($X$) | New (Reverse) Score ($X'$) |
| :-------------: | :------------------------: |
| 1 | **5** |
| 2 | **4** |
| 3 | **3** |
| 4 | **2** |
| 5 | **1** |

### Items Scored Normally

**All other items** (6, 7, 8, 9, 10) are scored normally. The raw score for these items is used directly in the summation (Raw Score = Final Score).

## Step 2: Summation and Interpretation ➕

### Calculation

The final score for Rational Ability (RA Score) is calculated by **summing the final scores (original or reverse-scored)** for all 10 items.

$$\text{RA Score} = \sum_{i=1}^{5} \text{Item}_{i}' + \sum_{i=6}^{10} \text{Item}_{i}$$

*(Note: Items with a prime symbol, like $1'$, denote the reverse-scored value.)*

### Score Range

The theoretical range for the Rational Ability Subscale score is:

| Measure | Calculation | Score | Interpretation |
| :-----: | :---------: | :---: | :------------: |
| **Minimum** | $10 \times 1$ | 10 | Lowest Self-Perceived Ability |
| **Maximum** | $10 \times 5$ | 50 | Highest Self-Perceived Ability |

### Evaluation

* A score **closer to 50** indicates a **strong belief in one's rational ability** (high capability for logical analysis and careful reasoning).
* A score **closer to 10** indicates a **low belief in one's rational ability** (perceived difficulty with analytical thinking).
* For formal interpretation, the score should be compared against **established normative data** (mean and standard deviation) from the REI validation studies.
