# 📄 Scoring Guide for the Basic Empathy Scale for Adults (BES-A) – Cognitive Subscale

This guide explains the two-step process required to transform raw responses from the 9-item Cognitive Empathy (CE) subscale of the BES-A (Carré et al., 2013) into an interpretable total score.

## Step 1: Reverse Scoring 🔄

The Cognitive Subscale uses a 5-point Likert scale where respondents select a score from 1 to 5:

* **1** = Disagree Strongly
* **2** = Disagree a Little
* **3** = Neither
* **4** = Agree a Little
* **5** = Agree Strongly

To ensure a higher final score always indicates **higher cognitive empathy**, certain items must be **reverse-scored**. These are the items that are phrased in a **negative** direction, meaning agreeing with them reflects a *low* level of empathy.

### Items to be Reverse-Scored

Identify the following items from the 9-item Cognitive Subscale:

| Item Number | Item Text |
| :---: | :--- |
| **2** | I find it hard to know when my friends are frightened. |
| **8** | I am not usually aware of my friends' feelings. |
| **9** | I have trouble figuring out when my friends are happy. |

If a participant's response to one of these three items is $X$, the new score ($X'$) used for calculation is transformed as follows:

| Raw Score ($X$) | New (Reverse) Score ($X'$) |
| :-------------: | :------------------------: |
| 1 | **5** |
| 2 | **4** |
| 3 | **3** |
| 4 | **2** |
| 5 | **1** |

### Items Scored Normally

**All other items** (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) are scored normally. The raw score for these items is used directly in the summation (Raw Score = Final Score).

## Step 2: Summation and Interpretation ➕

### Calculation

The final score for Cognitive Empathy (CE Score) is calculated by **summing the final scores (original or reverse-scored)** for all 9 items.

$$\text{CE Score} = \text{Item } 1 + \text{Item } 2' + \text{Item } 3 + \text{Item } 4 + \text{Item } 5 + \text{Item } 6 + \text{Item } 7 + \text{Item } 8' + \text{Item } 9'$$

*(Note: Items with a prime symbol, like $2'$, denote the reverse-scored value.)*

### Score Range

The theoretical range for the Cognitive Empathy Subscale score is:

| Measure | Calculation | Score | Interpretation |
| :-----: | :---------: | :---: | :------------: |
| **Minimum** | $9 \times 1$ | 9 | Lowest Empathy |
| **Maximum** | $9 \times 5$ | 45 | Highest Empathy |

### Evaluation

* A score **closer to 45** indicates a **high level of cognitive empathy** (strong ability to understand and identify others' perspectives and feelings).
* A score **closer to 9** indicates a **low level of cognitive empathy** (difficulty in understanding others' internal states).
* For formal interpretation, the score should be compared against **established normative data** (mean and standard deviation) from the BES-A validation studies.
